26137460,BMI as a Predictor for Potential Difficult Tracheal Intubation in Males,"Introduction: Difficult tracheal intubation is a common source of mortality and morbidity in surgical and critical care settings. The incidence reported of difficult tracheal intubation is 0.1%-13% and reaches 14% in the obese population. The objective of our retrospective study was to investigate and compare the utility of body mass index (BMI) as indicator of difficult tracheal intubation in males and females. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent abdominal surgeries with American Society of Anesthesiologists I to V under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation. The following information was obtained from medical records for analysis: gender, age, height, weight, BMI, length of patient stay in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, past medical history of sleep apnea, Mallampati score, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification assigned by the anesthesia care provider performing the endotracheal intubation. Results: Of 4303 adult patients, 1970 (45.8%) men and 2333 (54.2%) women were enrolled in the study. Within this group, a total of 1673 (38.9%) patients were morbidly obese. The average age of the study group was 51.4 ± 15.8 and the average BMI was 29.7 ± 8.2 kg/m(2). The overall incidence of the encountered difficult intubations was 5.23% or 225 subjects. Thus, our results indicate that BMI is a reliable predictor of difficult tracheal intubation predominantly in the male population; another strong predictor, with a positive linear correlation, being the Mallampati score. Conclusion: In conclusion, our data shows that BMI is a reliable indicator of potential difficult tracheal intubation only in male surgical patients.",1,1
27252905,Predictors of Difficult Intubation Among Malay Patients in Indonesia,"Background: Failure to maintain an adequate airway can lead to brain damage and death. To reduce the risk of difficulty in maintaining an airway during general anesthesia, there are several known predictors of difficult intubation. People with a Malay background have different craniofacial structures in comparison with other individuals. Therefore, different predictors should be used for patients of Malay race. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx (DVL) in Malay patients based on several predictors, such as the modified Mallampati test (MMT), thyromental distance (TMD), and hyomental distance ratio (HMDR). Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study included 277 consecutive patients requiring general anesthesia. All subjects were evaluated using the MMT, TMD, and HMDR, and the cut-off points for the airway predictors were Mallampati III and IV, < 6.5 cm, and < 1.2, respectively. During direct laryngoscopy, the laryngeal view was graded using the Cormack-Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult visualization. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for each predictor were calculated both as sole and combined predictors. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of DVL. Results: Difficulty in visualizing the larynx was found in 28 (10.1%) patients. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for the three airway predictors were as follows: MMT: 0.614, 10.7%, and 99.2%; HMDR: 0.743, 64.2%, and 74%; and TMD: 0.827, 82.1%, and 64.7%. The combination providing the best prediction in our study involved the MMT, HMDR, and TMD with an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.835, 60.7%, and 88.8%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the MMT, HMDR, and TMD were independent predictors of DVL. Conclusions: The TMD, with a cut-off point of 65 mm, had superior diagnostic value compared with the HMDR and Mallampati score. Therefore, the TMD could be used in Malay patients to predict the difficulty of larynx visualization during laryngoscopy.",1,1
2015145,Comparison of two methods for predicting difficult intubation,"Two methods of predicting difficult laryngoscopy were compared prospectively. Mallampati class and Wilson risk-sum were determined before operation and laryngeal view graded in 675 patients. Both tests identified five of 12 difficult laryngoscopies; twice as many patients were predicted to be difficult by Mallampati classification than by Wilson risk-sum. Inter-observer variation was minimal using Wilson risk-sum, but considerable for Mallampati classification. We prefer the Wilson risk-sum for assessment of the airway, while noting that both tests have poor sensitivities.",1,1
19293691,"Prediction and outcomes of impossible mask ventilation: a review of 50,000 anesthetics","Background: There are no existing data regarding risk factors for impossible mask ventilation and limited data regarding its incidence. The authors sought to determine the incidence, predictors, and outcomes associated with impossible mask ventilation. Methods: The authors performed an observational study over a 4-yr period. For each adult patient undergoing a general anesthetic, preoperative patient characteristics, detailed airway physical exam, and airway outcome data were collected. The primary outcome was impossible mask ventilation defined as the inability to exchange air during bag-mask ventilation attempts, despite multiple providers, airway adjuvants, or neuromuscular blockade. Secondary outcomes included the final, definitive airway management technique and direct laryngoscopy view. The incidence of impossible mask ventilation was calculated. Independent (P < 0.05) predictors of impossible mask ventilation were identified by performing a logistic regression full model fit. Results: Over a 4-yr period from 2004 to 2008, 53,041 attempts at mask ventilation were recorded. A total of 77 cases of impossible mask ventilation (0.15%) were observed. Neck radiation changes, male sex, sleep apnea, Mallampati III or IV, and presence of beard were identified as independent predictors. The receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve for this model was 0.80 +/- 0.03. Nineteen impossible mask ventilation patients (25%) also demonstrated difficult intubation, with 15 being intubated successfully. Twelve patients required an alternative intubation technique, including two surgical airways and two patients who were awakened and underwent successful fiberoptic intubation. Conclusions: Impossible mask ventilation is an infrequent airway event that is associated with difficult intubation. Neck radiation changes represent the most significant clinical predictor of impossible mask ventilation in the patient dataset.",1,1
24106353,Comparison of Mallampati test with lower jaw protrusion maneuver in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation,"Background: Failure to maintain a patent airway is one of the commonest causes of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Many protocols, algorithms, and different combinations of tested methods for airway assessment have been developed to predict difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. The reported incidence of a difficult intubation varies from 1.5% to 13%. The objective of this study was to compare Mallampati test (MT) with lower jaw protrusion (LJP) maneuver in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Materials and methods: Seven hundred and sixty patients were included in the study. All the patients underwent MT and LJP maneuver for their airway assessment. After a standardized technique of induction of anesthesia, primary anesthetist performed laryngoscopy and graded it according to the grades described by Cormack and Lehane. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for both these tests with 95% confidence interval (CI) using conventional laryngoscopy as gold standard. Area under curve was also calculated for both, MT and LJP maneuver. A P < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: LJP maneuver had higher sensitivity (95.9% vs. 27.1%), NPV (98.7% vs. 82.0%), and accuracy (90.1% vs. 80.3%) when compared to MT in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Both tests, however, had similar specificity and PPV. There was marked difference in the positive and negative likelihood ratio between LJP and MT. Similarly, the area under the curve favored LJP maneuver over MT. Conclusion: The results of this study show that LJP maneuver is a better test to predict difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. We recommend the addition of this maneuver to the routine preoperative evaluation of airway.",1,1
25252511,To compare the accuracy of prayer's sign and Mallampatti test in predicting difficult intubation in diabetic patients,"Objective: To determine the accuracy of Prayer's sign and Mallampatti test in predicting difficult endotracheal intubation in diabetic patients. Methods: The cross-sectional study was performed at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, over a period from January 2009 to April 2010, and comprised 357 patients who required endotracheal intubation for elective surgical procedures. Prayer's sign and Mallampatti tests were performed for the assessment of airway by trained observers. Ease or difficulty of laryngoscopy after the patient was fully anaesthetised with standard technique were observed and laryngoscopic view of first attempt was rated according to Cormack-Lehan grade of intubation. SPSS 15 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 357 patients, 125 (35%) were classified as difficult to intubate. Prayer's sign showed significantly lower accuracy, positive and negative predictive values than Mallampatti test. The sensitivity of Prayer's sign was lower 29.6 (95% Confidence Interval, 21.9-38.5) than Mallampatti test 79.3 (95% confidence interval, 70.8-85.7) while specificity of both the tests was not found to be significantly different. Conclusion: Prayer's sign is not acceptable as a single best bedside test for prediction of difficult intubation.",1,1
12514157,Predicting difficult orotracheal intubation in pharyngo-laryngeal disease: preliminary results of a composite index,"Purpose: Prediction of difficulty in orotracheal intubation (DI) in patients undergoing laryngeal microsurgery should help reduce the morbidity-mortality associated with this clinical situation. To establish a simple score to predict this difficulty, we studied 11 variables and their association with DI in these patients. Methods: The study included 181 patients. The variables evaluated were: Mallampati grade, thyromental distance, mouth opening, temporomandibular joint movement, tooth morphology, maxillary deficiency, head and neck movement, receding mandible, body mass index, and clinical symptoms of laryngeal and supraglottic disease. To establish the score, regression coefficients of the statistically significant variables were used on adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results: DI was present in 50 patients (28%) and orotracheal intubation was impossible in four (2%). Except for obesity, all the variables evaluated were predictive of DI. A simple predictive test was established based on logistic regression analysis including all the variables except temporomandibular joint movement. To determine the optimum cut-off for the new test, a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied. A score > or = 5 in the proposed test provided a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 76%. Conclusion: The index we describe is aimed at predicting DI in a very specific population with a high risk of this complication. This index uses a series of variables which may be measured easily during the preoperative period and provides an excellent predictive capacity with a high sensitivity and specificity when the index is > or = 5.",1,1
18349184,The importance of increased neck circumference to intubation difficulties in obese patients,"Background: Using the intubation difficulty scale (IDS), we sought to confirm that obese patients are more difficult to intubate than lean patients. We assessed classical bedside tests and included neck circumference. Methods: We prospectively compared the incidence of difficult tracheal intubation in 70 obese [body mass index (BMI) > or = 30 kg/m(2)] and 61 lean patients (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)). The IDS scores, categorized as difficult intubation (IDS > 5) or not (IDS < or = 5), and the patient data, were compared between lean and obese patients. Preoperative measurements [BMI, neck circumference (at the level of the thyroid cartilage), width of mouth opening, sternomental distance, and thyromental distance], medical history of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and several scores (Mallampati, Wilson, El Ganzouri) were recorded. The view during direct laryngoscopy was graded, and the IDS was recorded. We then compared patients with IDS < or = 5 and > 5, concerning each item. Results: The results indicate that difficult tracheal intubation is more frequent in obese than in lean patients (14.3% vs 3%; P = 0.03). In the patients with IDS > 5, thyromental distance, BMI, large neck circumference, and higher Mallampati score were the only predictors of potential intubation problems. Conclusion: We found that problematic intubation was associated with thyromental distance, increasing neck circumference, BMI, and a Mallampati score of > or = 3. Neck circumference should be assessed preoperatively to predict difficult intubation.",1,1
8795315,Difficult intubation: thyromental distance and the atlanto-occipital gap,Ten patients with a history of difficult intubation and 10 control patients were examined clinically and radiologically. It was shown that thyromental distance can be measured reliably clinically and further support is given to its usefulness as a predictor of difficult intubation. We were unable to demonstrate a conclusive link between thyromental distance and atlanto-occipital or atlanto-axial gaps. A review of X rays in other collections may add to the understanding of these factors in difficult intubation.,1,1
25177576,Risk Factors Assessment of the Difficult Intubation using Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS),"Background: The major responsibility of anaesthesiologist is to maintain adequate gas exchange in his patients in all circumstances and this require that patency of upper airway is constantly maintained. Problems with upper airway management are among the most frequent causes of anaesthetic mishaps. Using intubation difficulty scale (IDS) we made an attempt to objectively assess the predictors of difficult intubation. We assessed classical bedside tests such as modified Mallampati test, Thyromental distance test and also neck extension test. Methods: We prospectively observed 400 patients undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, for each patient intubation difficulty score was recorded during intubation. Risk factors assessment of difficult intubation done using IDS. Risk factor assessed includes modified mallampati class III and IV, thyromental distance ≤ 6cm and neck extension < 5cm. Patients were categorised as Easy intubation (IDS, 0 to 2), slightly difficult intubation (IDS, 3 to 4) and difficult intubation (IDS 5). Preoperative airway assessment was done by thyromental distance measurement, neck extension measurement and modified mallampati test. Data was analysed using Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) for each test computed. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The incidence of difficult intubation was 8% and there were no failure to intubate the trachea. The AUC were as follows: modified Mallampati test 0.473 (p<0.005), Thyromental distance test 0.753 (p<0.005) and neck extension test 0.768 (p<0.005). Conclusion: The results indicate that neck extension test is strongest predictor of difficult intubation (IDS≥5) in comparison to Thyromental test and modified mallampati test.",1,1
19457894,"Avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents may increase the risk of difficult tracheal intubation: a cohort study of 103,812 consecutive adult patients recorded in the Danish Anaesthesia Database","Background: Previous studies indicate that avoiding neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may be a risk factor for difficult tracheal intubation (DTI). We investigated whether avoiding NMBA was associated with DTI. Methods: A cohort of 103,812 consecutive patients planned for tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy was retrieved from the Danish Anaesthesia Database. We used an intubation score based upon the number of attempts, change from direct laryngoscopy to a more advanced technique, or intubation by a different operator. We retrieved data on age, sex, ASA physical status classification, priority of surgery, time of surgery, previous DTI, modified Mallampati score, BMI, and the use of NMBA. Using logistic regression, we assessed whether avoiding NMBA was associated with DTI. Results: The frequency of DTI was 5.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.0-5.3]%. In a univariate analysis, avoiding NMBA was associated with DTI, odds ratio (OR) 1.52 (95% CI: 1.43-1.61)%, P<0.0001. Using multivariate analysis, avoiding NMBA was associated with DTI, OR 1.48 (95% CI: 1.39-1.58), P<0.0001. Among patients intubated using NMBA, a multivariate analysis identified patients anaesthetized with only non-depolarizing NMBA to be more at risk for DTI than those anaesthetized with depolarizing NMBA alone. Conclusions: Avoiding NMBA may increase the risk of DTI. However, confounding by indication may be a problem in this observational study and systematic reviews with meta-analysis or more randomized clinical trials are needed.",1,1
9602574,Preoperative assessment for difficult intubation in general and ENT surgery: predictive value of a clinical multivariate risk index,"Several clinical multifactorial indexes have been described for predicting difficult laryngoscopy or intubation, or both, mostly in general surgery, and less frequently in ENT surgery. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a single clinical index for prediction of difficulty in tracheal intubation in both ENT and general surgery. We studied a population of 1200 consecutive ENT and general surgical patients. Clinical criteria were tested using univariate and multivariate analysis. Difficult intubation was defined as requiring unusual techniques. Logistic regression identified seven criteria as independent predictors of difficult tracheal intubation; previous history of difficult intubation; pathologies associated with difficult intubation; clinical symptoms of pathological airway; inter-incisor gap and mandible luxation; thyromental distance; head and neck movement; and Mallampati's modified test. Point values were assigned to each of these factors in proportion to regression coefficients representing the relative weight of each predictive intubation difficulty factor, the sum comprising the score. The best predictive threshold was chosen using a receiver operating characteristic curve. We then prospectively studied and validated the score in a population of 1090 consecutive ENT and general surgery patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictions were 94% and 96% in general surgery, 90% and 93% in non-cancer ENT surgery, and 92% and 66% in ENT cancer surgery, respectively.",1,1
7576671,A study of radiologic imaging techniques and airway grading to predict a difficult endotracheal intubation,"Study objectives: To study whether a detailed radiographic examination of neck and upper airway can help identify normal looking patients in whom endotracheal intubation may be difficult; determine whether such parameters as identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be identified in a soft tissue radiograph; and to study the correlation between oropharyngeal appearance, based on Mallampati's classification, and laryngoscopic findings in a large number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation. Design: Prospective. Setting: University medical center. Patients: 20 adult patients in whom an unanticipated difficult endotracheal intubation was encountered, and a control group of 20 patients in whom endotracheal intubation was easily accomplished. Interventions: Difficult-to-intubate patients were identified according to prospectively established criteria. Control subjects, in whom the trachea was easily intubated, were matched for age, gender, height, weight, and oropharyngeal appearance. Measurements and main results: In all 40 study patients, a soft tissue radiograph and an MRI scan of the neck were obtained. We measured 21 parameters from both radiographic studies. There were no significant differences between the two groups in 20 of 21 measured parameters on MRI scans and soft tissue radiographs. Only one measurement--the distance between the uppermost visible part of the airway and the posterior pharyngeal wall (measured from MRI scans only)--between the two groups achieved statistical significance. The values recorded from MRI and soft tissue radiographs were not significantly different. Airway grading system first suggested by Mallampati had a fair correlation with laryngoscopy findings associated with a difficult endotracheal intubation. Conclusions: No significant difference between the two groups could be identified on soft tissue radiography or MRI scans.",1,1
20118795,Predicting difficult laryngoscopy in acromegaly: a comparison of upper lip bite test with modified Mallampati classification,"Upper lip bite test (ULBT) is a simple test for predicting difficult intubation. However, it has not been evaluated in acromegalic patients. The primary aim of this study was to compare ULBT with modified Mallampati classification (MMPC) to predict difficult laryngoscopy in acromegalic patients. Over a 5-year period, 64 acromegalic and 63 nonacromegalic patients presenting for excision of pituitary tumor were enrolled. Preoperative airway assessment was done using MMPC and the ULBT. Under anesthesia, laryngoscopic view was assessed using Cormack-Lehane (CL) grading. MMPC III/IV and ULBT grade III were considered predictive of difficult laryngoscopy that was defined as Cormack-Lehane grades III or IV. Difficult intubation was defined as more than 2 direct laryngoscopy attempts involving change of blade or use of bougie/fiberoptic bronchoscope/intubating laryngeal mask airway. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of both tests in predicting difficult laryngoscopy were calculated. Incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in acromegalics were 24% and 11%, respectively. MMPC and ULBT predicted difficulty in 61% and 14% acromegalics, respectively. However, only 26% and 44% of the laryngoscopies predicted to be difficult by MMMC and ULBT, respectively, were actually difficult. MMPC failed to predict 33% of difficult laryngoscopies whereas ULBT failed to predict 73%. Neither test predicted difficulty in 33% laryngoscopies that turned out to be difficult. Twenty-seven percent of the difficult laryngoscopies were correctly predicted by both tests. In acromegalic group, MMPC was more sensitive, whereas ULBT was more specific. Sensitivity and accuracy of both tests were less in acromegalic patients compared with nonacromegalic controls.",1,1
24403616,Difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in the Indian population: An assessment of anatomical and clinical risk factors,"Background and aim: Differences in patient characteristics due to race or ethnicity may influence the incidence of difficult airway. Our purpose was to determine the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation, as well as the anatomical features and clinical risk factors that influence them, in the Indian population. Methods: In 330 adult patients receiving general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation, airway characteristics and clinical factors were determined and their association with difficult laryngoscopy (Cormack and Lehane grade 3 and 4) was analysed. Intubation Difficulty Scale score was used to identify degree of difficult laryngoscopy. Results: The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation was 9.7% and 4.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that increasing age and weight, male gender, modified Mallampati class (MMC) 3 and 4 in sitting and supine positions, inter-incisor distance (IID) ≤3.5 cm, thyromental (TMD) and sternomental distance, ratio of height and TMD, short neck, limited mandibular protrusion, decreased range of neck movement, history of snoring, receding mandible and cervical spondylosis were associated with difficult laryngoscopy. Multivariate analysis identified four variables that were independently associated with difficult laryngoscopy: MMC class 3 and 4, range of neck movement <80°, IID ≤ 3.5 cm and snoring. Conclusions: We found an incidence of 9.7% and 4.5% for difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation, respectively, in Indian patients with apparently normal airways. MMC class 3 and 4, range of neck movement <80°, IID ≤ 3.5 cm and snoring were independently related to difficult laryngoscopy. There was a high incidence (48.5%) of minor difficulty in intubation.",1,1
20049576,Rapid sequence induction for appendectomies: a retrospective case-review analysis,"Purpose: Rapid sequence induction (RSI) with cricoid pressure is suggested to decrease the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. However, the effectiveness of RSI has been questioned, and the technique may lead to airway and hemodynamic complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of RSI use in patients with acute appendicitis, the types of drugs administered, and the occurrence of any complications. Methods: After approval by the Ethics Committee, the charts of patients undergoing appendectomy in a one-year period were examined retrospectively. Information was retrieved on Mallampati airway evaluation, airway device used, preoxygenation, RSI, and drugs at induction. Reported complications were noted, including airway difficulties, hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) and hypertension (>160 mmHg) in the 20-min period after induction. Results: General anesthesia with tracheal intubation was used in 248 of 250 cases reviewed. The Mallampati airway evaluation, preoxygenation, and RSI were recorded as performed in 95, 94, and 81% of cases, respectively. Opioids, propofol, and neuromuscular blocking agents were given in 98, 98, and 99% of patients, respectively. Succinylcholine use was common (80%), with 96% of these patients receiving rocuronium precurarization. Difficult intubation with successful alternate technique was encountered in three patients (1.2%). Hypotension and hypertension occurred in 27% and 8% of patients, respectively. There were no documented cases of aspiration. Oxygen desaturation was mentioned in one case at induction and in three cases at emergence. Conclusion: An RSI with opioid, induction agent, and succinylcholine is the technique of choice for appendectomies at our institution. The frequency of airway complications is too low to recommend a change in practice.",1,1
21293546,Mallampati test as a predictor of laryngoscopic view,"Aim: To determine the accuracy of the modified Mallampati test for predicting difficult tracheal intubation. Design: A cross-sectional, clinical, observational, non-blinded study. A quality analysis of anesthetic care. Setting: Operating theatres and department of anesthesiology in a university hospital. Material and methods: Following the local ethics committee approval and patients' informed consent to anesthesia, all adult patients (> 18 yrs) presenting for any type of non-emergency surgical procedures under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were enrolled. Prior to anesthesia, Samsoon and Young's modification of the Mallampati test (modified Mallampati test) was performed. Following induction, the anesthesiologist described the laryngoscopic view using the Cormack-Lehane scale. Classes 3 or 4 of the modified Mallampati test were considered a predictor of difficult intubation. Grades 3 or 4 of the Cormack-Lehane classification of the laryngoscopic view were defined as impaired glottic exposure. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, relative risk, likelihood ratio and accuracy of the modified Mallampati test were calculated on 2x2 contingency tables. Results: Of the total 1,518 patients enrolled, 48 had difficult intubation (3.2%). We failed to detect as many as 35.4% patients in whom glottis exposure during direct laryngoscopy was inadequate (sensitivity 0.646). Compared to the original article by Mallampati, we found lower specificity (0.824 vs. 0.995), lower positive predictive value (0.107 vs. 0.933), higher negative predictive value (0.986 vs. 0.928), lower likelihood ratio (3.68 vs. 91.0) and accuracy (0.819 vs. 0.929). Conclusion: When used as a single examination, the modified Mallampati test is of limited value in predicting difficult intubation.",1,1
21610502,"Short thyromental distance is a surrogate for inadequate head extension, rather than small submandibular space, when indicating possible difficult direct laryngoscopy","Context: Airway research in anaesthesia shows that the thyromental distance (TMD) as a predictor of difficult intubation is subject to variable sensitivity and specificity. Recently, its value in this regard has been questioned with calls for a redefinition of its role. Objective(s): To define the role of TMD as a predictor of possible difficult laryngoscopy. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: A tertiary university teaching hospital. Patients or other participants: Two hundred and thirty-five consecutive patients (137 men), planned for endotracheal intubation anaesthesia, were enrolled in the study. Those who were edentulous, or had facial asymmetry, teeth protrusion, limited mouth opening, history of head and/or neck radiation therapy or any disorder, were excluded. Nobody was excluded once enrolled. Intervention(s): Preoperative straight-line morphometric measurements of the mandible and submandibular space (SMS) were taken by a measuring device and used to form a three-dimensional model of SMS. Sagittal dimensions of the SMS that determine the TMD were derived using trigonometric laws. Main outcome measures: Direct laryngoscopic view, assessed by a senior anaesthetist and classified according to Cormack/Lehane classification. Results: Thirty-two patients were reported to have 'limited laryngoscopic view'. The TMD had a sensitivity of 19% and a specificity of 97% as a predictor of laryngoscopic view. Among the factors that determine the magnitude of TMD, only the degree of head extension was significantly different between the two laryngoscopy groups. The other two factors (sagittal angulomental distance, representing mandibular growth, and sagittal angulothyroid distance, representing laryngeal descent in the neck) did not differ between the two groups. Also, the SMS volume did not differ between the two laryngoscopy groups. Conclusion: The role of the TMD in prediction of difficult laryngoscopy should be redefined from a variable representing the SMS volume to one acting as a surrogate for inadequate head extension.",1,1
21081769,Accurate classification of difficult intubation by computerized facial analysis,"Background: Bedside airway evaluation is conduced before anesthesia, but all current methods perform modestly, with low sensitivity and positive predictive value. We hypothesized that subjective features of patients' anatomies improve anesthesiologists' ability to predict difficult intubation, and derived a computer model to do so, based on analysis of photographs of patients' faces. Methods: Eighty male patients were divided into 2 equal cohorts for model derivation and validation. Each cohort consisted of 20 easy and 20 challenging intubations, defined as >1 attempt by an operator with at least 12 months of anesthesia experience, grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view, need for a second operator, or nonelective use of an alternative airway device. Photographs of each subject's face were analyzed by software that resolves each face into 61 facial proportions derived from an algorithm that models the face as a single point in a 50-dimensional eigenspace. Each parameter was tested for discriminatory ability by logistic regression, and combinations of 11 variables with P ≤ 0.1, plus Mallampati class and thyromental distance, were tested exhaustively by all possible binomial quadratic logistic regression models. Candidate models were cross-validated by maximizing the product of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves obtained in the derivation and validation cohorts. Results: The best model included 3 facial parameters and thyromental distance. It correctly classified 70 of 80 subjects (P < 10(-8)). In contrast, the best combination of Mallampati class and thyromental distance correctly classified 47 of 80 (P = 0.073). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve for the computer model were 90%, 85%, and 0.899, respectively. Conclusions: Computerized analysis of facial structure and thyromental distance can classify easy versus difficult intubation with accuracy significantly outperforming popular clinical predictive tests.",1,1
26166379,Prospective validation of the modified LEMON criteria to predict difficult intubation in the ED,"Background: Evidence to predict difficult intubation remains scarce in the emergency department (ED) setting. A previously defined clinical decision rule, the modified LEMON criteria, may provide a reliable and reproducible means of identifying difficult intubations. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the external validity of the modified LEMON criteria in the EDs. Methods: We conducted a 13-center prospective observational study, the second Japanese Emergency Airway Network study. We prospectively collected data on all patients undergoing intubations in the ED from February 2012 through September 2014. The primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the modified LEMON criteria for predicting difficult intubation (≥2 attempts by emergency attending physicians or anesthesiologists). Results: The database recorded a total of 4034 encounters (capture rate, 96%) in the EDs. Of these, 3313 patients (84%) underwent the intubation attempt with a direct laryngoscope and 610 patients (16%) with a video laryngoscope. The proportion of difficult intubation was 5.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7%-6.2%) in the direct laryngoscope group and 7.4% (95% CI, 5.6%-9.7%) in the video laryngoscope group. The sensitivity was 85.7% (95% CI, 79.3%-90.4%) with direct laryngoscope and 94.9% (95% CI, 83.5%-98.6%) with video laryngoscope. The specificity was 47.6% (95% CI, 47.2%-47.9%) and 40.3% (95% CI, 39.4%-40.6%), respectively. The negative predictive value was 98.2% (95% CI, 97.5%-98.8%) and 99.0% (95% CI, 96.6%-99.7%), respectively. Conclusions: In this multicenter prospective study, we found a high sensitivity and a negative predictive value of the modified LEMON criteria for predicting difficult intubation. The modified LEMON might assist ED providers in better identifying difficult intubations.",1,1
2265048,Factor analysis in difficult tracheal intubation: laryngoscopy-induced airway obstruction,"We have studied eight patients with a history of difficult tracheal intubation, using x-ray laryngoscopy and local anaesthesia, a curved Macintosh blade and a standard intubating position. The view obtained was better than recorded previously during general anaesthesia in two patients, and in a third the x-ray showed that positioning the blade tip beneath the epiglottis would have improved vision, suggesting that reproducibility of the assessment may not be consistent. The ""ease of intubation"" and ""complementary"" angles may be helpful in the assessment of such patients. A ""peardrop"" effect is described whereby during laryngoscopy, the epiglottis became pressed against the posterior pharyngeal wall as a result of tongue compression. In the absence of muscle paralysis, removal of the blade caused immediate correction. However, during anaesthesia with neuromuscular block it is suggested that this not only occurs more readily but, may not correct when the blade is removed. Iatrogenic airway obstruction during moderately difficult tracheal intubation may be common and should be anticipated.",0,0
17430592,Tumoral and non-tumoral trachea stenoses: evaluation with three-dimensional CT and virtual bronchoscopy,"Background: We evaluated the ability of 3D-CT and virtual bronchoscopy to estimate trachea stenosis in comparison to conventional axial CT and fiberoptic bronchoscopy, with a view to assist thoracic surgeons in depicting the anatomical characteristics of tracheal strictures. Methods: Spiral CT was performed in 16 patients with suspected tracheal stenoses and in 5 normal subjects. Tracheal stenoses due to an endoluminal neoplasm were detected in 13 patients, whilst post-intubation tracheal stricture was observed in the other 3 patients. Multiplanar reformatting (MPR), volume rendering techniques (VRT) and virtual endoscopy (VE) for trachea evaluation were applied and findings were compared to axial CT and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The accuracy of the procedure in describing the localization and degree of stenosis was tested by two radiologists in a blinded controlled trial. Results: The imaging modalities tested showed the same stenoses as the ones detected by flexible bronchoscopy and achieved accurate and non-invasive morphological characterization of the strictures, as well as additional information about the extraluminal extent of the disease. No statistically significant difference was observed between the bronchoscopic findings and the results of axial CT estimations (P = 1.0). No statistically significant differences were observed between bronchoscopic findings and the MPR, VRT and VE image evaluations (P = 0.705, 0.414 and 0.414 respectively). Conclusion: CT and computed generated images may provide a high fidelity, noninvasive and reproducible evaluation of the trachea compared to bronchoscopy. They may play a role in assessment of airway patency distal to high-grade stenoses, and represent a reliable alternative method for patients not amenable to conventional bronchoscopy.",0,0
11698324,Case report: a normal capnogram despite esophageal intubation,"Purpose: To report a case of accidental esophageal intubation which could not be detected by capnography. Clinical features: A 43-yr-old man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible underwent mandibulectomy, radical neck dissection, reconstruction of the mandible and radiation therapy. He was scheduled for revision surgery to the mandible. He had a limited mouth opening and neck movement after operation and radiation. After the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) was inserted, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane, and fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation attempted, but it was impossible to insert the fibrescope into the trachea because of a deformed larynx. While equipment for tracheostomy was prepared, one last attempt was made to insert the tube blindly into the trachea. The capnograph showed apparently normal carbon dioxide waveforms, and the reservoir bag inflated and deflated regularly. However, immediately after inflation of the cuff of the tracheal tube the reservoir bag movement stopped and CO(2) waveforms disappeared. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed that the tube was in fact in the esophagus. It was then noticed that the patient was still breathing spontaneously through the cuffed airway. The patient was awakened and tracheostomy performed. It was considered that egress of the expired gas was partially prevented by the cuffed airway, pooled in the oral cavity, aspirated down the esophagus during inspiration (likely to be due to negative intrathoracic pressure) and pushed out through the tube during expiration; inflation of the cuff prevented the gas entering the esophagus. Conclusion: Under such exceptional circumstances, apparently normal carbon dioxide waveforms were observed despite esophageal intubation in a spontaneously breathing patient.",0,0
23325943,One lung ventilation in a patient with an upper and lower airway abnormality,"One-lung ventilation for a thoracotomy procedure was achieved with the help of a endobronchial blocker in a young girl with limited mouth opening, minimal neck extension, and a distorted tracheo-bronchial anatomy. As the patient would not cooperate for an awake nasotracheal intubation despite adequate preperation, an inhalational anesthetic was used to make the patient unconscious, taking care that spontaneous breathing was maintained. Nasotracheal intubation was done with the help of a fiberoptic bronchoscope. A wire-guided Arndt endobronchial blocker was placed coaxially through the endotracheal tube using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. This case report highlights that in a scenario of both upper and lower airway distortion, a bronchial blocker positioned through a nasotracheal tube under fiberoptic guidance might be the best option when one-lung ventilation is required.",0,0
25403231,Role of anterior neck soft tissue quantifications by ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy,"Background: The aim of this study was to determine if ultrasound (US) measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at hyoid bone (DSHB), thyrohyoid membrane (DSEM), and anterior commissure (DSAC) levels can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopy. Material/methods: We included 203 patients age 20-65 years scheduled to undergo general anesthesia in this prospective observational study. Correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the roles of screening tests [interincisor gap (IIG), thyromental distance (TMD), modified Mallampati score (MMS)] and US measurements (DSHB, DSEM, DSAC) in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Results: There were 28 out of 203 patients categorized as difficult laryngoscopy. DSHB, DSEM, DSAC, and MMS were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group (P<0.0001). There was a strong positive correlation between DSEM and DSHB (r=0.74); moderate positive correlations between DSEM and DSAC (r=0.60), DSHB and DSAC (r=0.69); small positive correlations between MMS and DSHB (r=0.32), MMS and DSEM (r=0.27), MMS and DSAC (r=0.32), all P values £0.0001; very small positive correlation between TMD and IIG (r=0.18, P=0.0089); small negative correlation between IIG and MMS (r=-0.27, P=0.0001); and very small negative correlations between MMS and TMD (r=-0.20, P=0.004), IIG and DSAC (r=-0.18, P=0.011), IIG and DSHB (r=-0.15, P=0.034). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of MMS, DSHB, DSEM, and DSAC were significantly larger compared with the reference line (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Anterior neck soft tissue thicknesses measured by US at hyoid bone, thyrohyoid membrane, and anterior commissure levels are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. Combinations of those screening tests or risk factors with US measurements might increase the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
19317709,A simple fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope for paediatric difficult intubation: a manikin study,"The fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope is a new airway device. We compared the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope with the Bullard laryngoscope, Macintosh laryngoscope and fibreoptic bronchoscope in a manikin with a simulated Cormack and Lehane Grade 4 laryngoscopic view. Eighteen anaesthetists intubated the manikin's trachea using these devices and the success rate of intubation was measured. They were then asked to rate the subjective difficulty of intubation. The success rate (95% confidence interval) was 100% (94.6-100) with the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope, 88.9% (80.5-97.3) using the Bullard laryngoscope, 37.0% (24.1-49.9) with the Macintosh laryngoscope, and 22.2% (11.1-33.3) using the fibreoptic bronchoscope. Tracheal intubation using the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope or Bullard laryngoscope is easier than that using the Macintosh laryngoscope or fibreoptic bronchoscope by subjective difficulty score. All of the intubations were successful with the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope without practice. These results suggest that fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope may be a useful tool for paediatric difficult intubation.",0,0
6625347,Flow-volume curves reflect pharyngeal airway abnormalities in sleep apnea syndrome,"Twenty-nine patients with disorders of excessive somnolence were evaluated with standard nocturnal polysomnography, fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and flow-volume curves. Twenty-two had evidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by polysomnography and most had abnormal flow-volume curves, supporting earlier observations. Three of 7 patients without obstructive sleep apnea also had abnormal curves. Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy was performed in the OSA group while awake to evaluate the upper airway. Sixteen patients of the OSA group demonstrated pharyngeal obstruction; 14 of those with visualized airway obstruction had flow-volume abnormalities. In the 6 patients of the OSA group with no significant visual obstruction, 5 had normal curves. The flow-volume curve appears to correlate with direct visual assessment of upper airway patency during wakefulness in those patients demonstrating obstruction during sleep.",0,0
19672184,Bedside prediction of airway length in adults and children,"Background: Malpositioning of the endotracheal tube within the airway leads to serious complications such as endobronchial intubation. Prediction of the correct depth of an endotracheal tube is important and should be individualized. The manubriosternal joint (MSJ) is on the same horizontal plane with the tracheal carina. We compared the straight length from the upper incisor to the MSJ in the fully extended position (incisor-MSJ extension length) with the length from the upper incisor to the carina after intubation with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope through the endotracheal tube in the neutral position (incisor-carina neutral length). Methods: One hundred adults and 50 children were studied. Induction of anesthesia was achieved with 1.5 mg/kg propofol and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium IV. The incisor-MSJ extension length was measured after adequate mask ventilation. After intubation, the endotracheal tube was positioned properly at the upper incisor teeth, and the incisor-carina neutral length was measured with the fiberoptic bronchoscope at the carina. Results: The correlation between the incisor-MSJ extension length and the incisor-carina neutral length is significant (P < 0.001) in both adults and children. A formula for the regression line in adults (children) can be obtained as the incisor-carina neutral length (cm) = 0.868 (1.009) x the incisor-MSJ extension length (cm) + 4.260 (0.468) with a high coefficient of determination; r(2) = 0.88 (0.98). Conclusions: The airway length from the upper incisor to the carina in the neutral position can be predicted by the straight length from the upper incisor to the MSJ in the fully extended position.",0,0
26696483,[A clinical review of 3 cases of children with bronchial tumor],"Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of bronchial tumors in 3 children to improve the diagnosis of pediatric bronchial tumor. Methods: Three cases of children bronchial malignant tumors diagnosed by rigid bronchoscopy were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The 3 children were males, aged from 6 to 10 years old, and presented with cough, sputum, and fever symptoms for 1 day to 3 months. Chest CT scan and airway remodeling examinations indicated the children's main bronchi were blocked and then the diagnoses of bronchial foreign bodies were made. However bronchial tumors were found in the 3 children by rigid bronchoscopy and were determined as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, respectively. Conclusions: Children with bronchial tumor often present with cough, wheezing and other respiratory symptoms that are not specific to bronchial tumor. When a child complaint of repeated cough and wheezing symptoms with unknown cause, not only bronchial foreign body and also bronchial tumor should be considered.",0,0
27068119,Acute emergency care and airway management of caustic ingestion in adults: single center observational study,"Background: Caustic ingestions are rare but potentially life-threatening events requiring multidisciplinary emergency approaches. Although particularly respiratory functions may be impaired after caustic ingestions, studies involving acute emergency care are scarce. The goal of this study was to explore acute emergency care with respect to airway management and emergency department (ED) infrastructures. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated adult patients after caustic ingestions admitted to our university hospital over a 10-year period (2005-2014). Prognostic analysis included age, morbidity, ingested agent, airway management, interventions (endoscopy findings, computed tomography (CT), surgical procedures), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay in hospital and hospital mortality. Results: Twenty-eight patients with caustic ingestions were included in the analysis of which 18 (64%) had suicidal intentions. Ingested agents were caustic alkalis (n = 22; 79%) and acids (n = 6; 21%). ICU admission was required in 20 patients (71%). Fourteen patients (50%) underwent tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, of which 3 (21%) presented with difficult airways. Seven patients (25%) underwent tracheotomy including one requiring awake tracheotomy due to progressive upper airway obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 21 patients (75%) and 11 (39%) underwent CT examination. Five patients (18%) required emergency surgery with a mortality of 60%. Overall hospital mortality was 18% whereas the need for tracheal intubation (P = 0.012), CT-diagnostic (P = 0.001), higher EGD score (P = 0.006), tracheotomy (P = 0.048), and surgical interventions (P = 0.005) were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: Caustic ingestions in adult patients require an ED infrastructure providing 24/7-availability of expertise in establishing emergent airway safety, endoscopic examination (EGD and bronchoscopy), and CT diagnostic, intensive care and emergency esophageal surgery. We recommend that - even in patients with apparently stable clinical conditions - careful monitoring of respiratory functions should be considered as long as diagnostic work-up is completed.",0,0
8795326,Midazolam co-induction and laryngeal mask insertion,"We have studied the effect of alfentanil and midazolam+alfentanil on the conditions for laryngeal mask airway insertion in patients receiving propofol for induction of anaesthesia. Ninety unpremedicated. ASA 1 or 2 adult patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups: group P received propofol only (2.5 mg.kg-1); group PA received alfentanil (10 micrograms.kg-1) followed by propofol (1.25 mg.kg-1); group PMA received midazolam (0.04 mg.kg-1) and alfentanil (10 micrograms.kg-1) followed by propofol (1.25 mg.kg-1). Further boluses of propofol (0.25 mg.kg-1 every 15 s) were given if the initial dose was inadequate for induction of anaesthesia. Patients in the midazolam+alfentanil group required less propofol (p < 0.001), had better mouth opening (p < 0.001) and fewer undesired responses to laryngeal mask airway insertion (p < 0.001) than the other two groups.",0,0
18310841,Anesthesia management of awake craniotomy performed under asleep-awake-asleep technique using laryngeal mask airway: report of two cases,"Asleep-awake-asleep technique of anesthesia is used during awake craniotomy with or without securing airway. We assessed this technique using laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in two patients. Patients underwent awake craniotomy for epilepsy surgery and the removal of a frontotemporal glioma. After anesthesia induction, airway was secured using LMA. Anesthesia was maintained using oxygen, nitrous oxide and sevoflurane, supplemented with an infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Twenty minutes before corticography, anesthesia was discontinued and LMA removed. Both patients were awake and cooperative during the neurological assessment and surgery on eloquent areas. The LMA was reinserted before the closure of the dura and remained in place until the end of surgery. Both patients had no recall of events under anesthesia, although experienced mild pain and discomfort during awake phase of surgery. Both expressed complete satisfaction over the anesthetic management. Asleep-awake-asleep technique using LMA offers airway protection. The painful aspect of surgery can be performed under anesthesia, hence minimizing the duration of stress and pain. Patients remained awake and cooperative throughout the time of neurological testing.",0,0
25940662,Myhre-LAPs syndrome and intubation related airway stenosis: keys to diagnosis and critical therapeutic interventions,"Objectives: Myhre-LAPS syndrome is a recently recognized disease caused by a mutation in the SMAD4 gene. This results in a range of pathology including laryngotracheal stenosis, arthropathy, prognathism and short stature, or LAPS syndrome. We aim to delineate the role of intubation in development of airway stenosis in these patients as well as provide insight into diagnosis and management of this syndrome. Herein we present four patients with Myhre-LAPS syndrome complicated by airway stenosis and perform a systematic review of all cases of Myhre-LAPS syndrome with reported airway pathology. Study design: Retrospective review Methods: All patients diagnosed with Myhre-LAPS syndrome and airway stenosis at a single institution from 1981 to 2014 were reviewed. Results: Four patients (4F, median age 42) were identified that met inclusion criteria. Initial presenting signs included progressive shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion and respiratory distress. All four (100%) patients had multi-level airway stenosis most commonly in the subglottic and glottic regions and all patients had undergone at least one endotracheal intubation prior to presentation. One patient with a history of nasal tracheal intubation presented with nasal obstruction and was found to have choanal as well as subglottic stenosis. Two of the four (50%) patients are tracheostomy tube dependent, 1/4 (25%) died of a fatal cardiac arrhythmia and 1/4 (25%) has had 6 endoscopic treatments for subglottic stenosis in 4 years with rapid symptom recurrence. Conclusions: Myhre-LAPS syndrome is characterized by progressive systemic fibrosis and patients are diagnosed by characteristic findings of prognathism, short stature, abnormal facies, and thick skin among other abnormalities. Airway management is complicated by recurrent, refractory subglottic stenosis often preceded by elective intubation as well as maxillary hypoplasia, trismus, and limited neck extension. Endotracheal intubation and surgical intervention should be approached with caution in these patients and multidisciplinary care teams are necessary to address all manifestations of this syndrome.",0,0
26556848,Difficult Airway Society 2015 guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults,"These guidelines provide a strategy to manage unanticipated difficulty with tracheal intubation. They are founded on published evidence. Where evidence is lacking, they have been directed by feedback from members of the Difficult Airway Society and based on expert opinion. These guidelines have been informed by advances in the understanding of crisis management; they emphasize the recognition and declaration of difficulty during airway management. A simplified, single algorithm now covers unanticipated difficulties in both routine intubation and rapid sequence induction. Planning for failed intubation should form part of the pre-induction briefing, particularly for urgent surgery. Emphasis is placed on assessment, preparation, positioning, preoxygenation, maintenance of oxygenation, and minimizing trauma from airway interventions. It is recommended that the number of airway interventions are limited, and blind techniques using a bougie or through supraglottic airway devices have been superseded by video- or fibre-optically guided intubation. If tracheal intubation fails, supraglottic airway devices are recommended to provide a route for oxygenation while reviewing how to proceed. Second-generation devices have advantages and are recommended. When both tracheal intubation and supraglottic airway device insertion have failed, waking the patient is the default option. If at this stage, face-mask oxygenation is impossible in the presence of muscle relaxation, cricothyroidotomy should follow immediately. Scalpel cricothyroidotomy is recommended as the preferred rescue technique and should be practised by all anaesthetists. The plans outlined are designed to be simple and easy to follow. They should be regularly rehearsed and made familiar to the whole theatre team.",0,0
22020885,Management of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema,"Objectives/hypothesis: To develop and validate a clinical algorithm for management of patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema (AIIA). Study design: Prospective cohort observational study. Methods: Over 1 year, 40 patients with AIIA were evaluated by otolaryngology, underwent laryngoscopy, and were followed until disease resolution. The need for airway intervention, disposition for appropriate level of care, and other parameters were analyzed. Results: Treatment started within 61.5 minutes of presentation to the emergency department (ED). Mean duration until resolution of edema was 29 hours. Twenty (50%) patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and six (15%) required intubation. Seventeen (42.5%) were monitored and discharged from the ED. Floor-of-mouth edema was present in 19 (47.5%), and massive tongue edema was found in four (10%) patients. The aryepiglottic fold was involved in 20 (50%) patients on laryngoscopy. Older patients (P = .048) with subjective dyspnea (P = .003) and dysphonia (P = .001) were most likely to require ICU admission. Upper lip swelling had a negative correlation with airway edema identifiable on laryngoscopy alone (P = .008). Dysphonia (n = 16) predicted airway edema upon laryngoscopy (P = .001). All 40 patients were triaged successfully without the need for readmission or escalation of level of care. Conclusions: The management protocol was successful in 40 consecutive patients to the appropriate level of care. History and physical examination may predict airway findings identified on laryngoscopy and help guide management when treatment by otolaryngology is not immediately available. A subset of patients will require acute airway intervention and can be identified at initial presentation.",0,0
26419094,[Comparison of Seven Intubation Devices in Difficult Airway Model],"Background: The efficacy in tracheal intubation may differ between different video-optical devices, in particular in patients with difficult airways. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of video-laryngoscopes and fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) in tracheal intubation on a mannequin with several difficult airways, including limited mouth opening, cervical spine rigidity and tongue edema. Methods: Residents performed tracheal intubation on a mannequin using Macintosh laryngoscope (Mac), rigid indirect-optical intubation devices and FOB. The laryngeal view, the success rate of tracheal intubation, and the time to intubate trachea were recorded. Results: With limited mouth opening and cervical spine rigidity, video-optical intubation devices showed a significantly higher success rate of tracheal intubation than the Mac or FOB. In contrast, with tongue edema, the success rate of tracheal intubation was lower when Mac-type videolaryngoscopes were used. Conclusions: Videolaryngoscopes can generally be useful in patients with all difficult airways, but may be difficult in some circumstances (such as tongue edema). The FOB provided good laryngeal view in all cases, but the success rate of tracheal intubation was low and the time to intubate trachea was long.",0,0
22426568,Tracheobronchomalacia in children: review of diagnosis and definition,"Tracheobronchomalacia is characterised by excessive airway collapsibility due to weakness of airway walls and supporting cartilage. The standard definition requires reduction in cross-sectional area of at least 50% on expiration. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the normal range of central airway collapse among children of varying ages, ethnicities and genders, with and without coexisting pulmonary disease. Consequently, the threshold for pathological collapse is considered somewhat arbitrary. Available methods for assessing the airway dynamically--bronchoscopy, radiography, cine fluoroscopy, bronchography, CT and MR--have issues with reliability, the need for intubation, radiation dose and contrast administration. In addition, there are varying means of eliciting the diagnosis. Forced expiratory manoeuvres have been employed but can exaggerate normal physiological changes. Furthermore, radiographic evidence of tracheal compression does not necessarily translate into physiological or functional significance. Given that the criteria used to make the diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia are poorly validated, further studies with larger patient samples are required to define the threshold for pathological airway collapse.",0,0
19825049,Difficult and failed intubation in 3430 obstetric general anaesthetics,"A retrospective audit was performed of all obstetric general anaesthetics in our hospital over an 8 year period to determine the incidence of difficult and failed intubation. Data was collected from a number of sources to ensure accuracy. A total of 3430 rapid sequence anaesthetics were given. None of the patients had a failed or oesophageal intubation (95% CI, 0-1:1143). There were 23 difficult intubations (95% CI, 1:238-1:100). This was anticipated in nine cases, requiring awake fibreoptic intubation in three cases. Consultants or specialist registrars were involved in the management of all cases. We attribute the low incidence of airway complications to the above average rate of general anaesthesia in our hospital, senior cover and specialised anaesthetic operating department assistants.",0,0
18956939,A new grading of Pierre Robin sequence,"Objective: Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) involves the triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate. Neonates with PRS suffer from two problems--airway obstruction and feeding difficulties--but the severity of these problems varies greatly. The resultant varying definitions of PRS have resulted in inconsistent management of those babies given the diagnosis. This in turn makes comparison of published data and communication between clinicians difficult. Historically at Birmingham Children's Hospital, the cleft team only identified babies presenting with cleft palate and severe respiratory distress as ""true"" PRS. These babies were admitted to the high-dependency neonatal ward for airway assessment and management. Babies with a mild degree of respiratory obstruction but who were managed successfully at home were not classified as having PRS despite needing considerable input from the Cleft Clinical Nurse Specialist. A system of classifying babies with PRS based on the severity of their symptoms and signs and treatment required was therefore devised and is described in this paper. Results: Since implementation, this new classification of babies with PRS into three grades has clarified care pathways and enhanced communication between the Cleft Clinical Nurse Specialists and other health professionals involved with the care of these babies.",0,0
24418184,Office-based lower airway endoscopy (OLAE) in pediatric patients: a high-value procedure,"Objectives: Office-based lower airway endoscopy (OLAE) is not a widespread practice in children due to concerns about its safety and efficacy. In 2003, we reported on OLAE in 105 children presenting with airway symptoms and found it both safe and effective as a diagnostic tool. The current study is a follow-up to the 2003 study that reports on an additional 122 pediatric patients who received OLAE with special attention to the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Methods: A retrospective review at a tertiary-quaternary pediatric institution of 122 consecutive pediatric patients in which an airway lesion, by history and initial physical exam, was determined to be present at the level of the supraglottic larynx to the carina. In all patients, airway endoscopy was performed in the office using flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL) and the endoscope was passed beyond the glottis to assess the lower airway, including the subglottis, trachea, and carina. The diagnoses were recorded and the number of times each diagnosis was encountered as well as the percent of patients who had each diagnosis was calculated. All cases requiring operating room procedures for further diagnosis or therapy were assessed for office-based and operating room diagnostic agreement. The ease of performing the lower airway assessment and the ease with which the subglottis, trachea, and carina were visualized were graded. An assessment for complications was also performed. Results: There were no complications with OLAE in any of the 122 patients. The percent of patients rated as having good visualization of anatomic structures were: 97% for visualization of the subglottis, 98% for visualization of the trachea, and 92% for visualization of the carina. In 93% of the cases the procedure was easily performed. There was excellent correlation between OLAE and operative endoscopy. Conclusion: OLAE continues to be a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of lower airway pathology in pediatric patients.",0,0
