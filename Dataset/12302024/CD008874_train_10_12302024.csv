26137460,BMI as a Predictor for Potential Difficult Tracheal Intubation in Males,"Introduction: Difficult tracheal intubation is a common source of mortality and morbidity in surgical and critical care settings. The incidence reported of difficult tracheal intubation is 0.1%-13% and reaches 14% in the obese population. The objective of our retrospective study was to investigate and compare the utility of body mass index (BMI) as indicator of difficult tracheal intubation in males and females. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent abdominal surgeries with American Society of Anesthesiologists I to V under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation. The following information was obtained from medical records for analysis: gender, age, height, weight, BMI, length of patient stay in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, past medical history of sleep apnea, Mallampati score, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification assigned by the anesthesia care provider performing the endotracheal intubation. Results: Of 4303 adult patients, 1970 (45.8%) men and 2333 (54.2%) women were enrolled in the study. Within this group, a total of 1673 (38.9%) patients were morbidly obese. The average age of the study group was 51.4 ± 15.8 and the average BMI was 29.7 ± 8.2 kg/m(2). The overall incidence of the encountered difficult intubations was 5.23% or 225 subjects. Thus, our results indicate that BMI is a reliable predictor of difficult tracheal intubation predominantly in the male population; another strong predictor, with a positive linear correlation, being the Mallampati score. Conclusion: In conclusion, our data shows that BMI is a reliable indicator of potential difficult tracheal intubation only in male surgical patients.",1,1
27252905,Predictors of Difficult Intubation Among Malay Patients in Indonesia,"Background: Failure to maintain an adequate airway can lead to brain damage and death. To reduce the risk of difficulty in maintaining an airway during general anesthesia, there are several known predictors of difficult intubation. People with a Malay background have different craniofacial structures in comparison with other individuals. Therefore, different predictors should be used for patients of Malay race. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx (DVL) in Malay patients based on several predictors, such as the modified Mallampati test (MMT), thyromental distance (TMD), and hyomental distance ratio (HMDR). Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study included 277 consecutive patients requiring general anesthesia. All subjects were evaluated using the MMT, TMD, and HMDR, and the cut-off points for the airway predictors were Mallampati III and IV, < 6.5 cm, and < 1.2, respectively. During direct laryngoscopy, the laryngeal view was graded using the Cormack-Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult visualization. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for each predictor were calculated both as sole and combined predictors. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of DVL. Results: Difficulty in visualizing the larynx was found in 28 (10.1%) patients. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for the three airway predictors were as follows: MMT: 0.614, 10.7%, and 99.2%; HMDR: 0.743, 64.2%, and 74%; and TMD: 0.827, 82.1%, and 64.7%. The combination providing the best prediction in our study involved the MMT, HMDR, and TMD with an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.835, 60.7%, and 88.8%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the MMT, HMDR, and TMD were independent predictors of DVL. Conclusions: The TMD, with a cut-off point of 65 mm, had superior diagnostic value compared with the HMDR and Mallampati score. Therefore, the TMD could be used in Malay patients to predict the difficulty of larynx visualization during laryngoscopy.",1,1
2015145,Comparison of two methods for predicting difficult intubation,"Two methods of predicting difficult laryngoscopy were compared prospectively. Mallampati class and Wilson risk-sum were determined before operation and laryngeal view graded in 675 patients. Both tests identified five of 12 difficult laryngoscopies; twice as many patients were predicted to be difficult by Mallampati classification than by Wilson risk-sum. Inter-observer variation was minimal using Wilson risk-sum, but considerable for Mallampati classification. We prefer the Wilson risk-sum for assessment of the airway, while noting that both tests have poor sensitivities.",1,1
19293691,"Prediction and outcomes of impossible mask ventilation: a review of 50,000 anesthetics","Background: There are no existing data regarding risk factors for impossible mask ventilation and limited data regarding its incidence. The authors sought to determine the incidence, predictors, and outcomes associated with impossible mask ventilation. Methods: The authors performed an observational study over a 4-yr period. For each adult patient undergoing a general anesthetic, preoperative patient characteristics, detailed airway physical exam, and airway outcome data were collected. The primary outcome was impossible mask ventilation defined as the inability to exchange air during bag-mask ventilation attempts, despite multiple providers, airway adjuvants, or neuromuscular blockade. Secondary outcomes included the final, definitive airway management technique and direct laryngoscopy view. The incidence of impossible mask ventilation was calculated. Independent (P < 0.05) predictors of impossible mask ventilation were identified by performing a logistic regression full model fit. Results: Over a 4-yr period from 2004 to 2008, 53,041 attempts at mask ventilation were recorded. A total of 77 cases of impossible mask ventilation (0.15%) were observed. Neck radiation changes, male sex, sleep apnea, Mallampati III or IV, and presence of beard were identified as independent predictors. The receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve for this model was 0.80 +/- 0.03. Nineteen impossible mask ventilation patients (25%) also demonstrated difficult intubation, with 15 being intubated successfully. Twelve patients required an alternative intubation technique, including two surgical airways and two patients who were awakened and underwent successful fiberoptic intubation. Conclusions: Impossible mask ventilation is an infrequent airway event that is associated with difficult intubation. Neck radiation changes represent the most significant clinical predictor of impossible mask ventilation in the patient dataset.",1,1
24106353,Comparison of Mallampati test with lower jaw protrusion maneuver in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation,"Background: Failure to maintain a patent airway is one of the commonest causes of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Many protocols, algorithms, and different combinations of tested methods for airway assessment have been developed to predict difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. The reported incidence of a difficult intubation varies from 1.5% to 13%. The objective of this study was to compare Mallampati test (MT) with lower jaw protrusion (LJP) maneuver in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Materials and methods: Seven hundred and sixty patients were included in the study. All the patients underwent MT and LJP maneuver for their airway assessment. After a standardized technique of induction of anesthesia, primary anesthetist performed laryngoscopy and graded it according to the grades described by Cormack and Lehane. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for both these tests with 95% confidence interval (CI) using conventional laryngoscopy as gold standard. Area under curve was also calculated for both, MT and LJP maneuver. A P < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: LJP maneuver had higher sensitivity (95.9% vs. 27.1%), NPV (98.7% vs. 82.0%), and accuracy (90.1% vs. 80.3%) when compared to MT in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Both tests, however, had similar specificity and PPV. There was marked difference in the positive and negative likelihood ratio between LJP and MT. Similarly, the area under the curve favored LJP maneuver over MT. Conclusion: The results of this study show that LJP maneuver is a better test to predict difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. We recommend the addition of this maneuver to the routine preoperative evaluation of airway.",1,1
2265048,Factor analysis in difficult tracheal intubation: laryngoscopy-induced airway obstruction,"We have studied eight patients with a history of difficult tracheal intubation, using x-ray laryngoscopy and local anaesthesia, a curved Macintosh blade and a standard intubating position. The view obtained was better than recorded previously during general anaesthesia in two patients, and in a third the x-ray showed that positioning the blade tip beneath the epiglottis would have improved vision, suggesting that reproducibility of the assessment may not be consistent. The ""ease of intubation"" and ""complementary"" angles may be helpful in the assessment of such patients. A ""peardrop"" effect is described whereby during laryngoscopy, the epiglottis became pressed against the posterior pharyngeal wall as a result of tongue compression. In the absence of muscle paralysis, removal of the blade caused immediate correction. However, during anaesthesia with neuromuscular block it is suggested that this not only occurs more readily but, may not correct when the blade is removed. Iatrogenic airway obstruction during moderately difficult tracheal intubation may be common and should be anticipated.",0,0
17430592,Tumoral and non-tumoral trachea stenoses: evaluation with three-dimensional CT and virtual bronchoscopy,"Background: We evaluated the ability of 3D-CT and virtual bronchoscopy to estimate trachea stenosis in comparison to conventional axial CT and fiberoptic bronchoscopy, with a view to assist thoracic surgeons in depicting the anatomical characteristics of tracheal strictures. Methods: Spiral CT was performed in 16 patients with suspected tracheal stenoses and in 5 normal subjects. Tracheal stenoses due to an endoluminal neoplasm were detected in 13 patients, whilst post-intubation tracheal stricture was observed in the other 3 patients. Multiplanar reformatting (MPR), volume rendering techniques (VRT) and virtual endoscopy (VE) for trachea evaluation were applied and findings were compared to axial CT and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The accuracy of the procedure in describing the localization and degree of stenosis was tested by two radiologists in a blinded controlled trial. Results: The imaging modalities tested showed the same stenoses as the ones detected by flexible bronchoscopy and achieved accurate and non-invasive morphological characterization of the strictures, as well as additional information about the extraluminal extent of the disease. No statistically significant difference was observed between the bronchoscopic findings and the results of axial CT estimations (P = 1.0). No statistically significant differences were observed between bronchoscopic findings and the MPR, VRT and VE image evaluations (P = 0.705, 0.414 and 0.414 respectively). Conclusion: CT and computed generated images may provide a high fidelity, noninvasive and reproducible evaluation of the trachea compared to bronchoscopy. They may play a role in assessment of airway patency distal to high-grade stenoses, and represent a reliable alternative method for patients not amenable to conventional bronchoscopy.",0,0
11698324,Case report: a normal capnogram despite esophageal intubation,"Purpose: To report a case of accidental esophageal intubation which could not be detected by capnography. Clinical features: A 43-yr-old man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible underwent mandibulectomy, radical neck dissection, reconstruction of the mandible and radiation therapy. He was scheduled for revision surgery to the mandible. He had a limited mouth opening and neck movement after operation and radiation. After the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) was inserted, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane, and fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation attempted, but it was impossible to insert the fibrescope into the trachea because of a deformed larynx. While equipment for tracheostomy was prepared, one last attempt was made to insert the tube blindly into the trachea. The capnograph showed apparently normal carbon dioxide waveforms, and the reservoir bag inflated and deflated regularly. However, immediately after inflation of the cuff of the tracheal tube the reservoir bag movement stopped and CO(2) waveforms disappeared. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed that the tube was in fact in the esophagus. It was then noticed that the patient was still breathing spontaneously through the cuffed airway. The patient was awakened and tracheostomy performed. It was considered that egress of the expired gas was partially prevented by the cuffed airway, pooled in the oral cavity, aspirated down the esophagus during inspiration (likely to be due to negative intrathoracic pressure) and pushed out through the tube during expiration; inflation of the cuff prevented the gas entering the esophagus. Conclusion: Under such exceptional circumstances, apparently normal carbon dioxide waveforms were observed despite esophageal intubation in a spontaneously breathing patient.",0,0
23325943,One lung ventilation in a patient with an upper and lower airway abnormality,"One-lung ventilation for a thoracotomy procedure was achieved with the help of a endobronchial blocker in a young girl with limited mouth opening, minimal neck extension, and a distorted tracheo-bronchial anatomy. As the patient would not cooperate for an awake nasotracheal intubation despite adequate preperation, an inhalational anesthetic was used to make the patient unconscious, taking care that spontaneous breathing was maintained. Nasotracheal intubation was done with the help of a fiberoptic bronchoscope. A wire-guided Arndt endobronchial blocker was placed coaxially through the endotracheal tube using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. This case report highlights that in a scenario of both upper and lower airway distortion, a bronchial blocker positioned through a nasotracheal tube under fiberoptic guidance might be the best option when one-lung ventilation is required.",0,0
25403231,Role of anterior neck soft tissue quantifications by ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy,"Background: The aim of this study was to determine if ultrasound (US) measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at hyoid bone (DSHB), thyrohyoid membrane (DSEM), and anterior commissure (DSAC) levels can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopy. Material/methods: We included 203 patients age 20-65 years scheduled to undergo general anesthesia in this prospective observational study. Correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the roles of screening tests [interincisor gap (IIG), thyromental distance (TMD), modified Mallampati score (MMS)] and US measurements (DSHB, DSEM, DSAC) in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Results: There were 28 out of 203 patients categorized as difficult laryngoscopy. DSHB, DSEM, DSAC, and MMS were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group (P<0.0001). There was a strong positive correlation between DSEM and DSHB (r=0.74); moderate positive correlations between DSEM and DSAC (r=0.60), DSHB and DSAC (r=0.69); small positive correlations between MMS and DSHB (r=0.32), MMS and DSEM (r=0.27), MMS and DSAC (r=0.32), all P values £0.0001; very small positive correlation between TMD and IIG (r=0.18, P=0.0089); small negative correlation between IIG and MMS (r=-0.27, P=0.0001); and very small negative correlations between MMS and TMD (r=-0.20, P=0.004), IIG and DSAC (r=-0.18, P=0.011), IIG and DSHB (r=-0.15, P=0.034). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of MMS, DSHB, DSEM, and DSAC were significantly larger compared with the reference line (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Anterior neck soft tissue thicknesses measured by US at hyoid bone, thyrohyoid membrane, and anterior commissure levels are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. Combinations of those screening tests or risk factors with US measurements might increase the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
