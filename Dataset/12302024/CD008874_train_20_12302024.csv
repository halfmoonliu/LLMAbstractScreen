26137460,BMI as a Predictor for Potential Difficult Tracheal Intubation in Males,"Introduction: Difficult tracheal intubation is a common source of mortality and morbidity in surgical and critical care settings. The incidence reported of difficult tracheal intubation is 0.1%-13% and reaches 14% in the obese population. The objective of our retrospective study was to investigate and compare the utility of body mass index (BMI) as indicator of difficult tracheal intubation in males and females. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent abdominal surgeries with American Society of Anesthesiologists I to V under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation. The following information was obtained from medical records for analysis: gender, age, height, weight, BMI, length of patient stay in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, past medical history of sleep apnea, Mallampati score, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification assigned by the anesthesia care provider performing the endotracheal intubation. Results: Of 4303 adult patients, 1970 (45.8%) men and 2333 (54.2%) women were enrolled in the study. Within this group, a total of 1673 (38.9%) patients were morbidly obese. The average age of the study group was 51.4 ± 15.8 and the average BMI was 29.7 ± 8.2 kg/m(2). The overall incidence of the encountered difficult intubations was 5.23% or 225 subjects. Thus, our results indicate that BMI is a reliable predictor of difficult tracheal intubation predominantly in the male population; another strong predictor, with a positive linear correlation, being the Mallampati score. Conclusion: In conclusion, our data shows that BMI is a reliable indicator of potential difficult tracheal intubation only in male surgical patients.",1,1
27252905,Predictors of Difficult Intubation Among Malay Patients in Indonesia,"Background: Failure to maintain an adequate airway can lead to brain damage and death. To reduce the risk of difficulty in maintaining an airway during general anesthesia, there are several known predictors of difficult intubation. People with a Malay background have different craniofacial structures in comparison with other individuals. Therefore, different predictors should be used for patients of Malay race. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx (DVL) in Malay patients based on several predictors, such as the modified Mallampati test (MMT), thyromental distance (TMD), and hyomental distance ratio (HMDR). Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study included 277 consecutive patients requiring general anesthesia. All subjects were evaluated using the MMT, TMD, and HMDR, and the cut-off points for the airway predictors were Mallampati III and IV, < 6.5 cm, and < 1.2, respectively. During direct laryngoscopy, the laryngeal view was graded using the Cormack-Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult visualization. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for each predictor were calculated both as sole and combined predictors. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of DVL. Results: Difficulty in visualizing the larynx was found in 28 (10.1%) patients. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for the three airway predictors were as follows: MMT: 0.614, 10.7%, and 99.2%; HMDR: 0.743, 64.2%, and 74%; and TMD: 0.827, 82.1%, and 64.7%. The combination providing the best prediction in our study involved the MMT, HMDR, and TMD with an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.835, 60.7%, and 88.8%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the MMT, HMDR, and TMD were independent predictors of DVL. Conclusions: The TMD, with a cut-off point of 65 mm, had superior diagnostic value compared with the HMDR and Mallampati score. Therefore, the TMD could be used in Malay patients to predict the difficulty of larynx visualization during laryngoscopy.",1,1
2015145,Comparison of two methods for predicting difficult intubation,"Two methods of predicting difficult laryngoscopy were compared prospectively. Mallampati class and Wilson risk-sum were determined before operation and laryngeal view graded in 675 patients. Both tests identified five of 12 difficult laryngoscopies; twice as many patients were predicted to be difficult by Mallampati classification than by Wilson risk-sum. Inter-observer variation was minimal using Wilson risk-sum, but considerable for Mallampati classification. We prefer the Wilson risk-sum for assessment of the airway, while noting that both tests have poor sensitivities.",1,1
19293691,"Prediction and outcomes of impossible mask ventilation: a review of 50,000 anesthetics","Background: There are no existing data regarding risk factors for impossible mask ventilation and limited data regarding its incidence. The authors sought to determine the incidence, predictors, and outcomes associated with impossible mask ventilation. Methods: The authors performed an observational study over a 4-yr period. For each adult patient undergoing a general anesthetic, preoperative patient characteristics, detailed airway physical exam, and airway outcome data were collected. The primary outcome was impossible mask ventilation defined as the inability to exchange air during bag-mask ventilation attempts, despite multiple providers, airway adjuvants, or neuromuscular blockade. Secondary outcomes included the final, definitive airway management technique and direct laryngoscopy view. The incidence of impossible mask ventilation was calculated. Independent (P < 0.05) predictors of impossible mask ventilation were identified by performing a logistic regression full model fit. Results: Over a 4-yr period from 2004 to 2008, 53,041 attempts at mask ventilation were recorded. A total of 77 cases of impossible mask ventilation (0.15%) were observed. Neck radiation changes, male sex, sleep apnea, Mallampati III or IV, and presence of beard were identified as independent predictors. The receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve for this model was 0.80 +/- 0.03. Nineteen impossible mask ventilation patients (25%) also demonstrated difficult intubation, with 15 being intubated successfully. Twelve patients required an alternative intubation technique, including two surgical airways and two patients who were awakened and underwent successful fiberoptic intubation. Conclusions: Impossible mask ventilation is an infrequent airway event that is associated with difficult intubation. Neck radiation changes represent the most significant clinical predictor of impossible mask ventilation in the patient dataset.",1,1
24106353,Comparison of Mallampati test with lower jaw protrusion maneuver in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation,"Background: Failure to maintain a patent airway is one of the commonest causes of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Many protocols, algorithms, and different combinations of tested methods for airway assessment have been developed to predict difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. The reported incidence of a difficult intubation varies from 1.5% to 13%. The objective of this study was to compare Mallampati test (MT) with lower jaw protrusion (LJP) maneuver in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Materials and methods: Seven hundred and sixty patients were included in the study. All the patients underwent MT and LJP maneuver for their airway assessment. After a standardized technique of induction of anesthesia, primary anesthetist performed laryngoscopy and graded it according to the grades described by Cormack and Lehane. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for both these tests with 95% confidence interval (CI) using conventional laryngoscopy as gold standard. Area under curve was also calculated for both, MT and LJP maneuver. A P < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: LJP maneuver had higher sensitivity (95.9% vs. 27.1%), NPV (98.7% vs. 82.0%), and accuracy (90.1% vs. 80.3%) when compared to MT in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Both tests, however, had similar specificity and PPV. There was marked difference in the positive and negative likelihood ratio between LJP and MT. Similarly, the area under the curve favored LJP maneuver over MT. Conclusion: The results of this study show that LJP maneuver is a better test to predict difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. We recommend the addition of this maneuver to the routine preoperative evaluation of airway.",1,1
25252511,To compare the accuracy of prayer's sign and Mallampatti test in predicting difficult intubation in diabetic patients,"Objective: To determine the accuracy of Prayer's sign and Mallampatti test in predicting difficult endotracheal intubation in diabetic patients. Methods: The cross-sectional study was performed at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, over a period from January 2009 to April 2010, and comprised 357 patients who required endotracheal intubation for elective surgical procedures. Prayer's sign and Mallampatti tests were performed for the assessment of airway by trained observers. Ease or difficulty of laryngoscopy after the patient was fully anaesthetised with standard technique were observed and laryngoscopic view of first attempt was rated according to Cormack-Lehan grade of intubation. SPSS 15 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 357 patients, 125 (35%) were classified as difficult to intubate. Prayer's sign showed significantly lower accuracy, positive and negative predictive values than Mallampatti test. The sensitivity of Prayer's sign was lower 29.6 (95% Confidence Interval, 21.9-38.5) than Mallampatti test 79.3 (95% confidence interval, 70.8-85.7) while specificity of both the tests was not found to be significantly different. Conclusion: Prayer's sign is not acceptable as a single best bedside test for prediction of difficult intubation.",1,1
12514157,Predicting difficult orotracheal intubation in pharyngo-laryngeal disease: preliminary results of a composite index,"Purpose: Prediction of difficulty in orotracheal intubation (DI) in patients undergoing laryngeal microsurgery should help reduce the morbidity-mortality associated with this clinical situation. To establish a simple score to predict this difficulty, we studied 11 variables and their association with DI in these patients. Methods: The study included 181 patients. The variables evaluated were: Mallampati grade, thyromental distance, mouth opening, temporomandibular joint movement, tooth morphology, maxillary deficiency, head and neck movement, receding mandible, body mass index, and clinical symptoms of laryngeal and supraglottic disease. To establish the score, regression coefficients of the statistically significant variables were used on adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results: DI was present in 50 patients (28%) and orotracheal intubation was impossible in four (2%). Except for obesity, all the variables evaluated were predictive of DI. A simple predictive test was established based on logistic regression analysis including all the variables except temporomandibular joint movement. To determine the optimum cut-off for the new test, a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied. A score > or = 5 in the proposed test provided a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 76%. Conclusion: The index we describe is aimed at predicting DI in a very specific population with a high risk of this complication. This index uses a series of variables which may be measured easily during the preoperative period and provides an excellent predictive capacity with a high sensitivity and specificity when the index is > or = 5.",1,1
18349184,The importance of increased neck circumference to intubation difficulties in obese patients,"Background: Using the intubation difficulty scale (IDS), we sought to confirm that obese patients are more difficult to intubate than lean patients. We assessed classical bedside tests and included neck circumference. Methods: We prospectively compared the incidence of difficult tracheal intubation in 70 obese [body mass index (BMI) > or = 30 kg/m(2)] and 61 lean patients (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)). The IDS scores, categorized as difficult intubation (IDS > 5) or not (IDS < or = 5), and the patient data, were compared between lean and obese patients. Preoperative measurements [BMI, neck circumference (at the level of the thyroid cartilage), width of mouth opening, sternomental distance, and thyromental distance], medical history of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and several scores (Mallampati, Wilson, El Ganzouri) were recorded. The view during direct laryngoscopy was graded, and the IDS was recorded. We then compared patients with IDS < or = 5 and > 5, concerning each item. Results: The results indicate that difficult tracheal intubation is more frequent in obese than in lean patients (14.3% vs 3%; P = 0.03). In the patients with IDS > 5, thyromental distance, BMI, large neck circumference, and higher Mallampati score were the only predictors of potential intubation problems. Conclusion: We found that problematic intubation was associated with thyromental distance, increasing neck circumference, BMI, and a Mallampati score of > or = 3. Neck circumference should be assessed preoperatively to predict difficult intubation.",1,1
8795315,Difficult intubation: thyromental distance and the atlanto-occipital gap,Ten patients with a history of difficult intubation and 10 control patients were examined clinically and radiologically. It was shown that thyromental distance can be measured reliably clinically and further support is given to its usefulness as a predictor of difficult intubation. We were unable to demonstrate a conclusive link between thyromental distance and atlanto-occipital or atlanto-axial gaps. A review of X rays in other collections may add to the understanding of these factors in difficult intubation.,1,1
25177576,Risk Factors Assessment of the Difficult Intubation using Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS),"Background: The major responsibility of anaesthesiologist is to maintain adequate gas exchange in his patients in all circumstances and this require that patency of upper airway is constantly maintained. Problems with upper airway management are among the most frequent causes of anaesthetic mishaps. Using intubation difficulty scale (IDS) we made an attempt to objectively assess the predictors of difficult intubation. We assessed classical bedside tests such as modified Mallampati test, Thyromental distance test and also neck extension test. Methods: We prospectively observed 400 patients undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, for each patient intubation difficulty score was recorded during intubation. Risk factors assessment of difficult intubation done using IDS. Risk factor assessed includes modified mallampati class III and IV, thyromental distance ≤ 6cm and neck extension < 5cm. Patients were categorised as Easy intubation (IDS, 0 to 2), slightly difficult intubation (IDS, 3 to 4) and difficult intubation (IDS 5). Preoperative airway assessment was done by thyromental distance measurement, neck extension measurement and modified mallampati test. Data was analysed using Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) for each test computed. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The incidence of difficult intubation was 8% and there were no failure to intubate the trachea. The AUC were as follows: modified Mallampati test 0.473 (p<0.005), Thyromental distance test 0.753 (p<0.005) and neck extension test 0.768 (p<0.005). Conclusion: The results indicate that neck extension test is strongest predictor of difficult intubation (IDS≥5) in comparison to Thyromental test and modified mallampati test.",1,1
2265048,Factor analysis in difficult tracheal intubation: laryngoscopy-induced airway obstruction,"We have studied eight patients with a history of difficult tracheal intubation, using x-ray laryngoscopy and local anaesthesia, a curved Macintosh blade and a standard intubating position. The view obtained was better than recorded previously during general anaesthesia in two patients, and in a third the x-ray showed that positioning the blade tip beneath the epiglottis would have improved vision, suggesting that reproducibility of the assessment may not be consistent. The ""ease of intubation"" and ""complementary"" angles may be helpful in the assessment of such patients. A ""peardrop"" effect is described whereby during laryngoscopy, the epiglottis became pressed against the posterior pharyngeal wall as a result of tongue compression. In the absence of muscle paralysis, removal of the blade caused immediate correction. However, during anaesthesia with neuromuscular block it is suggested that this not only occurs more readily but, may not correct when the blade is removed. Iatrogenic airway obstruction during moderately difficult tracheal intubation may be common and should be anticipated.",0,0
17430592,Tumoral and non-tumoral trachea stenoses: evaluation with three-dimensional CT and virtual bronchoscopy,"Background: We evaluated the ability of 3D-CT and virtual bronchoscopy to estimate trachea stenosis in comparison to conventional axial CT and fiberoptic bronchoscopy, with a view to assist thoracic surgeons in depicting the anatomical characteristics of tracheal strictures. Methods: Spiral CT was performed in 16 patients with suspected tracheal stenoses and in 5 normal subjects. Tracheal stenoses due to an endoluminal neoplasm were detected in 13 patients, whilst post-intubation tracheal stricture was observed in the other 3 patients. Multiplanar reformatting (MPR), volume rendering techniques (VRT) and virtual endoscopy (VE) for trachea evaluation were applied and findings were compared to axial CT and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The accuracy of the procedure in describing the localization and degree of stenosis was tested by two radiologists in a blinded controlled trial. Results: The imaging modalities tested showed the same stenoses as the ones detected by flexible bronchoscopy and achieved accurate and non-invasive morphological characterization of the strictures, as well as additional information about the extraluminal extent of the disease. No statistically significant difference was observed between the bronchoscopic findings and the results of axial CT estimations (P = 1.0). No statistically significant differences were observed between bronchoscopic findings and the MPR, VRT and VE image evaluations (P = 0.705, 0.414 and 0.414 respectively). Conclusion: CT and computed generated images may provide a high fidelity, noninvasive and reproducible evaluation of the trachea compared to bronchoscopy. They may play a role in assessment of airway patency distal to high-grade stenoses, and represent a reliable alternative method for patients not amenable to conventional bronchoscopy.",0,0
11698324,Case report: a normal capnogram despite esophageal intubation,"Purpose: To report a case of accidental esophageal intubation which could not be detected by capnography. Clinical features: A 43-yr-old man with osteogenic sarcoma of the mandible underwent mandibulectomy, radical neck dissection, reconstruction of the mandible and radiation therapy. He was scheduled for revision surgery to the mandible. He had a limited mouth opening and neck movement after operation and radiation. After the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) was inserted, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane, and fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation attempted, but it was impossible to insert the fibrescope into the trachea because of a deformed larynx. While equipment for tracheostomy was prepared, one last attempt was made to insert the tube blindly into the trachea. The capnograph showed apparently normal carbon dioxide waveforms, and the reservoir bag inflated and deflated regularly. However, immediately after inflation of the cuff of the tracheal tube the reservoir bag movement stopped and CO(2) waveforms disappeared. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed that the tube was in fact in the esophagus. It was then noticed that the patient was still breathing spontaneously through the cuffed airway. The patient was awakened and tracheostomy performed. It was considered that egress of the expired gas was partially prevented by the cuffed airway, pooled in the oral cavity, aspirated down the esophagus during inspiration (likely to be due to negative intrathoracic pressure) and pushed out through the tube during expiration; inflation of the cuff prevented the gas entering the esophagus. Conclusion: Under such exceptional circumstances, apparently normal carbon dioxide waveforms were observed despite esophageal intubation in a spontaneously breathing patient.",0,0
23325943,One lung ventilation in a patient with an upper and lower airway abnormality,"One-lung ventilation for a thoracotomy procedure was achieved with the help of a endobronchial blocker in a young girl with limited mouth opening, minimal neck extension, and a distorted tracheo-bronchial anatomy. As the patient would not cooperate for an awake nasotracheal intubation despite adequate preperation, an inhalational anesthetic was used to make the patient unconscious, taking care that spontaneous breathing was maintained. Nasotracheal intubation was done with the help of a fiberoptic bronchoscope. A wire-guided Arndt endobronchial blocker was placed coaxially through the endotracheal tube using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. This case report highlights that in a scenario of both upper and lower airway distortion, a bronchial blocker positioned through a nasotracheal tube under fiberoptic guidance might be the best option when one-lung ventilation is required.",0,0
25403231,Role of anterior neck soft tissue quantifications by ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy,"Background: The aim of this study was to determine if ultrasound (US) measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at hyoid bone (DSHB), thyrohyoid membrane (DSEM), and anterior commissure (DSAC) levels can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopy. Material/methods: We included 203 patients age 20-65 years scheduled to undergo general anesthesia in this prospective observational study. Correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the roles of screening tests [interincisor gap (IIG), thyromental distance (TMD), modified Mallampati score (MMS)] and US measurements (DSHB, DSEM, DSAC) in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Results: There were 28 out of 203 patients categorized as difficult laryngoscopy. DSHB, DSEM, DSAC, and MMS were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group (P<0.0001). There was a strong positive correlation between DSEM and DSHB (r=0.74); moderate positive correlations between DSEM and DSAC (r=0.60), DSHB and DSAC (r=0.69); small positive correlations between MMS and DSHB (r=0.32), MMS and DSEM (r=0.27), MMS and DSAC (r=0.32), all P values £0.0001; very small positive correlation between TMD and IIG (r=0.18, P=0.0089); small negative correlation between IIG and MMS (r=-0.27, P=0.0001); and very small negative correlations between MMS and TMD (r=-0.20, P=0.004), IIG and DSAC (r=-0.18, P=0.011), IIG and DSHB (r=-0.15, P=0.034). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of MMS, DSHB, DSEM, and DSAC were significantly larger compared with the reference line (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Anterior neck soft tissue thicknesses measured by US at hyoid bone, thyrohyoid membrane, and anterior commissure levels are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. Combinations of those screening tests or risk factors with US measurements might increase the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
19317709,A simple fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope for paediatric difficult intubation: a manikin study,"The fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope is a new airway device. We compared the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope with the Bullard laryngoscope, Macintosh laryngoscope and fibreoptic bronchoscope in a manikin with a simulated Cormack and Lehane Grade 4 laryngoscopic view. Eighteen anaesthetists intubated the manikin's trachea using these devices and the success rate of intubation was measured. They were then asked to rate the subjective difficulty of intubation. The success rate (95% confidence interval) was 100% (94.6-100) with the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope, 88.9% (80.5-97.3) using the Bullard laryngoscope, 37.0% (24.1-49.9) with the Macintosh laryngoscope, and 22.2% (11.1-33.3) using the fibreoptic bronchoscope. Tracheal intubation using the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope or Bullard laryngoscope is easier than that using the Macintosh laryngoscope or fibreoptic bronchoscope by subjective difficulty score. All of the intubations were successful with the fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope without practice. These results suggest that fibreoptic assisted laryngoscope may be a useful tool for paediatric difficult intubation.",0,0
6625347,Flow-volume curves reflect pharyngeal airway abnormalities in sleep apnea syndrome,"Twenty-nine patients with disorders of excessive somnolence were evaluated with standard nocturnal polysomnography, fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and flow-volume curves. Twenty-two had evidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by polysomnography and most had abnormal flow-volume curves, supporting earlier observations. Three of 7 patients without obstructive sleep apnea also had abnormal curves. Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy was performed in the OSA group while awake to evaluate the upper airway. Sixteen patients of the OSA group demonstrated pharyngeal obstruction; 14 of those with visualized airway obstruction had flow-volume abnormalities. In the 6 patients of the OSA group with no significant visual obstruction, 5 had normal curves. The flow-volume curve appears to correlate with direct visual assessment of upper airway patency during wakefulness in those patients demonstrating obstruction during sleep.",0,0
19672184,Bedside prediction of airway length in adults and children,"Background: Malpositioning of the endotracheal tube within the airway leads to serious complications such as endobronchial intubation. Prediction of the correct depth of an endotracheal tube is important and should be individualized. The manubriosternal joint (MSJ) is on the same horizontal plane with the tracheal carina. We compared the straight length from the upper incisor to the MSJ in the fully extended position (incisor-MSJ extension length) with the length from the upper incisor to the carina after intubation with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope through the endotracheal tube in the neutral position (incisor-carina neutral length). Methods: One hundred adults and 50 children were studied. Induction of anesthesia was achieved with 1.5 mg/kg propofol and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium IV. The incisor-MSJ extension length was measured after adequate mask ventilation. After intubation, the endotracheal tube was positioned properly at the upper incisor teeth, and the incisor-carina neutral length was measured with the fiberoptic bronchoscope at the carina. Results: The correlation between the incisor-MSJ extension length and the incisor-carina neutral length is significant (P < 0.001) in both adults and children. A formula for the regression line in adults (children) can be obtained as the incisor-carina neutral length (cm) = 0.868 (1.009) x the incisor-MSJ extension length (cm) + 4.260 (0.468) with a high coefficient of determination; r(2) = 0.88 (0.98). Conclusions: The airway length from the upper incisor to the carina in the neutral position can be predicted by the straight length from the upper incisor to the MSJ in the fully extended position.",0,0
26696483,[A clinical review of 3 cases of children with bronchial tumor],"Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of bronchial tumors in 3 children to improve the diagnosis of pediatric bronchial tumor. Methods: Three cases of children bronchial malignant tumors diagnosed by rigid bronchoscopy were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The 3 children were males, aged from 6 to 10 years old, and presented with cough, sputum, and fever symptoms for 1 day to 3 months. Chest CT scan and airway remodeling examinations indicated the children's main bronchi were blocked and then the diagnoses of bronchial foreign bodies were made. However bronchial tumors were found in the 3 children by rigid bronchoscopy and were determined as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, respectively. Conclusions: Children with bronchial tumor often present with cough, wheezing and other respiratory symptoms that are not specific to bronchial tumor. When a child complaint of repeated cough and wheezing symptoms with unknown cause, not only bronchial foreign body and also bronchial tumor should be considered.",0,0
27068119,Acute emergency care and airway management of caustic ingestion in adults: single center observational study,"Background: Caustic ingestions are rare but potentially life-threatening events requiring multidisciplinary emergency approaches. Although particularly respiratory functions may be impaired after caustic ingestions, studies involving acute emergency care are scarce. The goal of this study was to explore acute emergency care with respect to airway management and emergency department (ED) infrastructures. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated adult patients after caustic ingestions admitted to our university hospital over a 10-year period (2005-2014). Prognostic analysis included age, morbidity, ingested agent, airway management, interventions (endoscopy findings, computed tomography (CT), surgical procedures), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay in hospital and hospital mortality. Results: Twenty-eight patients with caustic ingestions were included in the analysis of which 18 (64%) had suicidal intentions. Ingested agents were caustic alkalis (n = 22; 79%) and acids (n = 6; 21%). ICU admission was required in 20 patients (71%). Fourteen patients (50%) underwent tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, of which 3 (21%) presented with difficult airways. Seven patients (25%) underwent tracheotomy including one requiring awake tracheotomy due to progressive upper airway obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 21 patients (75%) and 11 (39%) underwent CT examination. Five patients (18%) required emergency surgery with a mortality of 60%. Overall hospital mortality was 18% whereas the need for tracheal intubation (P = 0.012), CT-diagnostic (P = 0.001), higher EGD score (P = 0.006), tracheotomy (P = 0.048), and surgical interventions (P = 0.005) were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: Caustic ingestions in adult patients require an ED infrastructure providing 24/7-availability of expertise in establishing emergent airway safety, endoscopic examination (EGD and bronchoscopy), and CT diagnostic, intensive care and emergency esophageal surgery. We recommend that - even in patients with apparently stable clinical conditions - careful monitoring of respiratory functions should be considered as long as diagnostic work-up is completed.",0,0
