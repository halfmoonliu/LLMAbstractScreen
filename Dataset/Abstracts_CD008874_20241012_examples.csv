19020139,The extended Mallampati score and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus are predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in the morbidly obese,"Background: The modified Mallampati (MMP) classification is a standard method of oropharyngeal evaluation for predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Previous studies have demonstrated that the predictive value of the MMP is improved when the patient's craniocervical junction is extended rather than neutral (Extended Mallampati Score, EMS). In the present study, we compared the predictive value of the MMP and EMS in the morbidly obese. Methods: We performed a prospective study of adult patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) > or = 40 over a 12-mo period comparing the MMP and EMS. The performance of the MMP, EMS, and other commonly used tests was compared for the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy, defined as a Cormack-Lehane grade of 3 or 4. Positioning and direct laryngoscopic techniques were not standardized. The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation was compared in patients with BMI > or = or < 40. Results: Three-hundred-forty-six patients with a BMI > or = 40 were evaluated with both the MMP and EMS and received direct laryngoscopy. On average, craniocervical extension decreased the MMP class (P < 0.0001). Compared to the MMP, the EMS improved specificity and predictive value while maintaining sensitivity. Compared to the MMP and other tests, an EMS class of 3 or 4 and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were the only statistically significant predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in the morbidly obese. There was no difference in the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy or intubation in the morbidly obese compared to patients with a BMI < 40. Conclusions: The EMS was superior to the MMP in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in the morbidly obese population. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus also warrants further investigation as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in this population. Finally, this study supports previous findings that morbid obesity is not itself a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy or intubation.",1,1
17962241,Predictive value of the El-Ganzouri multivariate risk index for difficult tracheal intubation: a comparison of Glidescope videolaryngoscopy and conventional Macintosh laryngoscopy,"Background: The predictive value of the El-Ganzouri risk index (EGRI) for difficult intubation has been evaluated using Macintosh laryngoscopy as reference standard. The Glidescope videolaryngoscope provides improved visualization of the glottis. We studied the predictive value of the EGRI using videolaryngoscopy as reference standard. Methods: Data from two subsequent groups of patients, intubated with Macintosh laryngoscopy (ML, n = 994) and videolaryngoscopy (VL, n = 843), were retrospectively analysed. The EGRI was taken as index test. The two types of laryngoscopy were adopted as reference for the presence of Cormack and Lehane grading III-IV. For both groups, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative post-test probabilities (PTP) were calculated for thresholds on the EGRI scale. Receiver operating characteristic curves and corresponding areas (AUC) were obtained. Results: Sensitivity and specificity were 69.7% and 66.3% at the cut-off value of 2 in the ML group, and 93.3% and 76.6% at the cut-off value of 3 in the VL group. Corresponding positive and negative PTP were 12.81% and 3.15% in the ML group, and 6.73% and 0.16% in the VL group. At the threshold of 4, positive and negative PTP were 31.34% and 4.85% in the ML group. At the threshold of 7, positive and negative PTP were 85.71% and 1.08% in the VL group. The AUC was 0.74 in the ML group and 0.91 in the VL group. Conclusions: The predictive value of the EGRI may have been underestimated due to limited accuracy of Macintosh laryngoscopy. Using videolaryngoscopy, the EGRI might be reconsidered as a decisional tool.",1,1
19700274,A retrospective analysis of airway management in obese patients at a teaching institution,"Study objective: To identify patient characteristics that influence the choice of awake fiberoptic intubation (AFI) versus intubation after general anesthesia in obese patients. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Memorial Hermann Hospital, Houston, TX. Measurements: Perioperative records of 283 obese patients [body mass index (BMI) >34 kg/m2] who underwent elective surgery between January 1991 and December 1999 were studied. Patients' data were divided into two groups according to method of induction and intubation: asleep direct laryngoscopy versus AFI. Patient demographics, BMI, Mallampati airway classification, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, hiatal hernia, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were compared between the two groups. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Main results: AFI was performed in 12 (4.2%) obese patients, and direct laryngoscopy was performed in 271 (95.8%) obese patients. Difficult intubation was reported in 21 (7.4%) cases, and there were no reported cases of failed intubations. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that AFI patients were more likely to have a BMI > or = 60 kg/m2 (P < 0.001), Mallampati class III or IV airway (P < 0.001), and be men (P = 0.004). These three factors were also statistically significant in the multivariate logistic regression. In particular, each one kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with a 7% increased likelihood of AFI. Men were approximately 4 times likelier than women to have an AFI. Compared with patients with a Mallampati Class I or II airway, those with Mallampati Classes III or IV were about 26 times as likelier to have an AFI. Conclusions: Patients selected for AFI were predominantly men, with a Mallampati Class III or IV airway, and BMI > or = 60 kg/m2.",1,1
10050224,Prevalence and prediction of difficult intubation in Chinese women,"We conducted a prospective, blind observational study to investigate the prevalence and prediction of difficult intubation in Chinese women. Two groups of Chinese women were studied (151 pregnant and 260 non-pregnant). The prevalence of difficult intubation was 1.99% in the pregnant and 1.54% in the non-pregnant group. The difference was not statistically significant. Predictive variables for difficult intubation, including modified Mallampati class, thyromental distance and atlanto-occipital extension, had high sensitivity but low positive predictive value when used alone. A shorter thyromental distance had to be used as the criterion for prediction in Chinese women. Combination of predictive variables could improve the positive predictive value.",1,1
18471331,Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in obstetric patients scheduled for Caesarean delivery,"Background and objective: Failed intubation is an important cause of anaesthetic-related maternal mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx from the following preoperative airway predictive indices, in isolation and combination: modified Mallampati test, the ratio of height to thyromental distance and the Upper-Lip-Bite test. Methods: We collected data on 400 consecutive parturients scheduled for elective Caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation and then assessed all three factors before surgery. An experienced anaesthesiologist, not apprised of the recorded preoperative airway assessment, performed the laryngoscopy and grading (as per Cormack and Lehane's classification). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Results: Difficult laryngoscopy (Grade 3 or 4) occurred in 35 patients (8.75%). The ratio of height to thyromental distance had a higher sensitivity, positive predictive value and fewer false negatives than the other variables tested. The ratio of height to thyromental distance of 21.24 provided the best cut-off point for predicting subsequent difficult laryngoscopy. The odds ratio (95% CI) of the ratio of height to thyromental distance, Mallampati class and the Upper-Lip-Bite test were 127.8 (44.8-364.5), 49.8 (20.3-121.8) and 6.6 (2.29-19.30), respectively. Conclusion: The ratio of height to thyromental distance may prove a useful screening test for predicting difficult laryngoscopy in obstetric population.",1,1
1755552,[Comparative value of clinical signs of difficult tracheal intubation in women],"A prospective study was designed to compare the value of clinical signs aimed to predict difficult intubation in women. A group of 663 women, scheduled for elective surgery, were assessed by an anaesthetist at the preanaesthetic visit. Following parameters were assessed: the degree of mouth opening, the chin-hyoid bone and the chin-thyroid cartilage distances, dental and facial abnormalities, age, weight. All patients were ranked on the Mallampati scale. Another anaesthetist carried out the anaesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation. The latter was deemed to have been difficult if special procedures had been required (use of a stylet, a fibroscope, or Sellick's manoeuvre). In accordance with these criteria 12.5% of women were difficult to intubate. Furthermore, he assessed the degree of glottic exposure, using a Macintosh blade and according to Cormack's classification. Six per cent of women were ranked C or D in Cormack's classification (C: the glottic aperture was not seen; D: the epiglottis was not seen). Finally 66% of women with difficult intubation and 84% of those with severely abnormal glottic exposure were ranked greater than 1 on the Mallampati scale. This scale had high sensitivity (0.84), but a specificity of only 0.66. Other clinical criteria (mouth opening, the chin-hyoid bone distance) had a lower sensitivities, but seemed more specific. Multivariate analysis showed that specificity could be improved (0.84) if the distance between the upper and lower incisor teeth (mouth opening) was associated with Mallampati's rank, without any loss in sensitivity. A simple chart is proposed to assess the risk of difficult intubation.",1,1
23277808,Predictors of difficult intubation defined by the intubation difficulty scale (IDS): predictive value of 7 airway assessment factors,"Background: The intubation difficulty scale (IDS) has been used as a validated difficulty score to define difficult intubation (DI). The purpose of this study is to identify airway assessment factors and total airway score (TAS) for predicting DI defined by the IDS. Methods: There were 305 ASA physical status 1-2 patients, aged 19-70 years, who underwent elective surgery with endotracheal intubation. During the pre-anesthetic visit, we evaluated patients by 7 preoperative airway assessment factors, including the following: Mallampati classification, thyromental distance, head & neck movement, body mass index (BMI), buck teeth, inter-incisor gap, and upper lip bite test (ULBT). After endotracheal intubation, patients were divided into 2 groups based on their IDS score estimated with 7 variables: normal (IDS < 5) and DI (IDS ≥ 5) groups. The incidence of TAS (> 6) and high score of each airway assessment factor was compared in two groups: odds ratio, confidence interval (CI) of 95%, with a significant P value ≤ 0.05. Results: The odds ratio of TAS (> 6), ULBT (class III), head & neck movement (< 90°), inter-incisor gap (< 4 cm), BMI (≥ 25 kg/m(2)) and Mallampati classification (≥ class III) were respectively 13.57 (95% CI = 2.99-61.54, P < 0.05), 12.48 (95% CI = 2.50-62.21, P < 0.05), 3.11 (95% CI = 0.87-11.13), 2.32 (95% CI = 0.75-7.19), 2.22 (95% CI = 0.81-6.06), and 1.22 (95% CI = 0.38-3.89). Conclusions: We suggest that TAS (> 6) and ULBT (class III) are the most useful factors predicting DI.",1,1
21610502,"Short thyromental distance is a surrogate for inadequate head extension, rather than small submandibular space, when indicating possible difficult direct laryngoscopy","Context: Airway research in anaesthesia shows that the thyromental distance (TMD) as a predictor of difficult intubation is subject to variable sensitivity and specificity. Recently, its value in this regard has been questioned with calls for a redefinition of its role. Objective(s): To define the role of TMD as a predictor of possible difficult laryngoscopy. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: A tertiary university teaching hospital. Patients or other participants: Two hundred and thirty-five consecutive patients (137 men), planned for endotracheal intubation anaesthesia, were enrolled in the study. Those who were edentulous, or had facial asymmetry, teeth protrusion, limited mouth opening, history of head and/or neck radiation therapy or any disorder, were excluded. Nobody was excluded once enrolled. Intervention(s): Preoperative straight-line morphometric measurements of the mandible and submandibular space (SMS) were taken by a measuring device and used to form a three-dimensional model of SMS. Sagittal dimensions of the SMS that determine the TMD were derived using trigonometric laws. Main outcome measures: Direct laryngoscopic view, assessed by a senior anaesthetist and classified according to Cormack/Lehane classification. Results: Thirty-two patients were reported to have 'limited laryngoscopic view'. The TMD had a sensitivity of 19% and a specificity of 97% as a predictor of laryngoscopic view. Among the factors that determine the magnitude of TMD, only the degree of head extension was significantly different between the two laryngoscopy groups. The other two factors (sagittal angulomental distance, representing mandibular growth, and sagittal angulothyroid distance, representing laryngeal descent in the neck) did not differ between the two groups. Also, the SMS volume did not differ between the two laryngoscopy groups. Conclusion: The role of the TMD in prediction of difficult laryngoscopy should be redefined from a variable representing the SMS volume to one acting as a surrogate for inadequate head extension.",1,1
23968655,"A combination of the modified Mallampati score, thyromental distance, anatomical abnormality, and cervical mobility (M-TAC) predicts difficult laryngoscopy better than Mallampati classification","Objective: Unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in anesthetized patients. A number of modules have been developed to predict difficult airways, but they are often complex in nature. We combined the modified Mallampati score (M), thyromental distance (T), anatomical abnormality (A), and cervical mobility (C) into a single scoring system with the acronym M-TAC, and evaluated it against Mallampati scoring. Methods: We prospectively analyzed 500 adult patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Preoperative airway assessments using M-TAC were performed, all of which were given a score. Anesthesiologists, blinded to the pre-anesthetic airway assessment, performed laryngoscopy and graded the laryngoscopic view as per Cormack and Lehane's classification. For the study purpose, difficult laryngoscopy was defined as Cormack and Lehane Grade 3 or 4 of laryngoscopic view. Results: An M-TAC score ≥ 4 had a significantly higher sensitivity (96% vs. 72%) and specificity (86% vs. 78%) with a high positive predictive value (44% vs. 28%) and a very low false negative value (2% vs. 15%) in comparison with Mallampati scoring (p < 0.05). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for predicting difficult laryngoscopy revealed an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI = 0.78-0.88) for Mallampati scoring and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.92-0.96) for M-TAC scoring system. Conclusion: The M-TAC scoring system has provided a higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in comparison with Mallampati classification.",1,1
25885730,Comparison between different tests and their combination for prediction of difficult intubation: An analytical study,"Context: There is an impelling need for accurate tests to predict difficult intubation, as failure to achieve endotracheal intubation causes significant morbidity and mortality in anesthetic practice. Aim: To calculate the validity of the different tests along with their combination and agreement when compared with endotracheal intubation in predicting difficult intubation. Settings and design: Operation theaters, analytical study. Materials and methods: Three hundred patients aged between 16 and 60 years of American society of anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I and II, scheduled for elective surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation were studied during January-July 2012. Mallampati grade (MP), sternomental distance (SMD), thyromental distance (TMD), and Delilkan and Calder test were recorded for every patient. Endotracheal intubation was performed by an experienced anesthesiologist blinded to the measurements and recorded grading of intubation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR), odds ratio (OR), and kappa coefficient of tests individually and in combination were calculated. Statistical analysis used: IBM SPSS software (version 16.0) and Epi-info software (version 3.2). Results: Difficult and failed intubation was 13.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Difficult intubation increased with age. TMD and Calder test showed highest sensitivity individually and Dellilkan's test showed least sensitivity. Among the combination of tests, MP with SMD and MP with Calder test had the highest sensitivity. Conclusion: Among individual test TMD and Calder are better predictive tests in terms of sensitivity. Combination of tests increases the chance of prediction of difficult intubation.",1,1
26206397,Changes in difficult airway predictors following mandibular setback surgery,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of surgical mandibular backward movements on the predictors of a difficult airway. Thirty-seven skeletal class III patients were included in this study. The Mallampati score, body mass index (BMI), maximal inter-incisal distance, and thyromental and sternomental distances of these patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 6 months and 2 years postoperatively. A sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) without genioplasty was performed in all patients by the same surgical team, and anaesthesia was provided by the same anaesthesiologist using nasotracheal intubation. The paired samples t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for statistical comparisons of the data. There were no statistically significant changes in BMI or sternomental and thyromental distances after SSRO. The maximal inter-incisal distance was significantly reduced at 6 months postoperatively (P<0.05), but no statistical difference was found between the values obtained preoperatively and at 2 years postoperative. A statistically significant increase in Mallampati score was observed postoperatively (P<0.05). Both the patient and practitioner should be aware of the risks associated with an increased postoperative Mallampati score in mandibular setback patients. The amount of mandibular setback in skeletal class III patients with a high preoperative Mallampati score should be limited to prevent potential postoperative airway problems.",0,0
10172477,How should an unconscious person with a suspected neck injury be positioned?,"Introduction: Awareness of the risk of spinal-cord damage in moving an unconscious person with a suspected neck injury into the ""lateral recovery position,"" coupled with the even greater risk of inadequate airway management if the person is not moved, has resulted in a suggested modification to the lateral recovery position for use in this circumstance. Hypothesis: It is proposed that the modification to the lateral recovery position reduces movement of the neck. In this modification, one of the patient's arms is raised above the head (in full abduction) to support the head and neck. The position is called the ""HAINES modified recovery position."" HAINES is an acronym for High Arm IN Endangered Spine. Methods: Neck movements in two healthy volunteers were measured by the use of video-image analysis and radiographic studies when the volunteers were rolled from the supine position to both the lateral recovery position and the HAINES modified recovery position. Results: For both subjects, the total degree of lateral flexion of the cervical spine in the HAINES modified recovery position was less than half of that measured during use of the lateral recovery position (while an open airway was maintained in each). Conclusion: An unconscious person with a suspected neck injury should be positioned in the HAINES modified recovery position. There is less neck movement (and less degree of lateral angulation) than when the lateral recovery position is used, and, therefore, HAINES use carries less risk of spinal-cord damage.",0,0
24871114,[Validity of airway predictors in outpatient medicine],"Isolation of the airway sometimes determines the survival or death of the patient. To anticipate the presence of a difficult airway (DA) there are a number of indicators that are validated for hospitals: Mallampati, sternum and thyromental distance, interdental distance and Cormack grade. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of these indicators in the ambulatory setting and to know the incidence of DA. This data was collected from 324 intubations. Most patients were males (65.2%). The average age of the population was 63 years and no significant difference in age between DA and DA was found. A DA presence of 20.7% was objectified and an alternative device utilization of 21.4%. The thyromental distance was abnormal in 59% of patients and sternomentonal distance in 56.4% but neither showed an association with the presence of DA (p = 0.681 and p = 0.415 respectively). Interdental distance was less than 3 cm if presence is associated with DA (p = 0.005). The sensitivity and specificity of all measures are low. According to our series the sternum and thyromental distance are not useful in the ambulatory setting, but interdental distance is useful for predicting a DA.",0,0
16246268,Purification of full-length human pregnane and xenobiotic receptor: polyclonal antibody preparation for immunological characterization,"Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR; or Steroid and Xenobiotic Receptor, SXR), a new member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is thought to modulate a network of genes that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism and elimination. To further explore the role of PXR in body's homeostatic mechanisms, we for the first time, report successful prokaryotic expression and purification of full-length PXR and preparation of polyclonal antibody against the whole protein. The full-length cDNA encoding a 434 amino acids protein was sub-cloned into prokaryotic expression vector, pET-30b and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for efficient over expression. The inclusion body fraction, containing the expressed recombinant protein, was purified first by solubilizing in sarcosine extraction buffer and then by affinity column chromatography using Ni-NTA His-Bind matrix. The efficacy of anti-PXR antibody was confirmed by immunocytology, Western blot analysis, EMSA and immunohistochemistry. The antibody obtained was capable of detecting human and mouse PXR with high specificity and sensitivity. Immunofluorescence staining of COS-1 cells transfected with human or mouse PXR showed a clear nuclear localization. Results from immunohistochemistry showed that level of PXR in liver sections is immunologically detectable in the nuclei. Similar to exogenously transfected PXR, Western blot analysis of cell extract from HepG2 and COLO320DM cells revealed a major protein band for endogenous PXR having the expected molecular weight of 50 kDa. Relevance of other immunodetectable bands with reference to PXR isoforms and current testimony are evaluated. Advantages of antibody raised against full-length PXR protein for functional characterization of receptor is discussed and its application for clinical purposes is envisaged.",0,0
25935297,Evaluation of heavy metals in hazardous automobile shredder residue thermal residue and immobilization with novel nano-size calcium dispersed reagent,"This study was conducted to synthesize and apply a nano-size calcium dispersed reagent as an immobilization material for heavy metal-contaminated automobile shredder residues (ASR) dust/thermal residues in dry condition. Simple mixing with a nanometallic Ca/CaO/PO4 dispersion mixture immobilized 95-100% of heavy metals in ASR dust/thermal residues (including bottom ash, cavity ash, boiler and bag filter ash). The quantity of heavy metals leached from thermal residues after treatment by nanometallic Ca/CaO/PO4 was lower than the Korean standard regulatory limit for hazardous waste landfills. The morphology and elemental composition of the nanometallic Ca/CaO-treated ASR residue were characterized by field emission scanning election microscopy combined with electron dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS). The results indicated that the amounts of heavy metals detectable on the ASR thermal residue surface decreased and the Ca/PO4 mass percent increased. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis indicated that the main fraction of enclosed/bound materials on ASR residue included Ca/PO4- associated crystalline complexes, and that immobile Ca/PO4 salts remarkably inhibited the desorption of heavy metals from ASR residues. These results support the potential use of nanometallic Ca/CaO/PO4 as a simple, suitable and highly efficient material for the gentle immobilization of heavy metals in hazardous ASR thermal residue in dry condition.",0,0

26790624,Teaching basic lung isolation skills on human anatomy simulator: attainment and retention of lung isolation skills,"Background: Lung isolation skills, such as correct insertion of double lumen endobronchial tube and bronchial blocker, are essential in anesthesia training; however, how to teach novices these skills is underexplored. Our aims were to determine (1) if novices can be trained to a basic proficiency level of lung isolation skills, (2) whether video-didactic and simulation-based trainings are comparable in teaching lung isolation basic skills, and (3) whether novice learners' lung isolation skills decay over time without practice. Methods: First, five board certified anesthesiologist with experience of more than 100 successful lung isolations were tested on Human Airway Anatomy Simulator (HAAS) to establish Expert proficiency skill level. Thirty senior medical students, who were naive to bronchoscopy and lung isolation techniques (Novice) were randomized to video-didactic and simulation-based trainings to learn lung isolation skills. Before and after training, Novices' performances were scored for correct placement using pass/fail scoring and a 5-point Global Rating Scale (GRS); and time of insertion was recorded. Fourteen novices were retested 2 months later to assess skill decay. Results: Experts' and novices' double lumen endobronchial tube and bronchial blocker passing rates showed similar success rates after training (P >0.99). There were no differences between the video-didactic and simulation-based methods. Novices' time of insertion decayed within 2 months without practice. Conclusion: Novices could be trained to basic skill proficiency level of lung isolation. Video-didactic and simulation-based methods we utilized were found equally successful in training novices for lung isolation skills. Acquired skills partially decayed without practice.",0,0
8093140,Excursions of the cervical spine during tracheal intubation: blind oral intubation compared with direct laryngoscopy,"The most appropriate technique for performing tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine injury is debatable. Recently, a new device enabling blind oral intubation (Augustine Guide) with the patient's head and neck in the neutral position has been introduced. The aim of this study was to compare the extent of upper cervical spine movement during intubation with this device compared to direct laryngoscopy. Twelve patients (Mallampati I and II), without a cervical spine injury, were intubated using the Augustine Guide and afterwards by direct laryngoscopy. Both procedures were viewed radiographically. Extension in the upper cervical spine was determined at the point of the maximum excursion. By evaluating the joints occiput-C3 together as a functional unit, blind oral intubation caused 17 degrees (median) less extension compared to direct laryngoscopy (p < 0.01). The median differences observed for the individual joints were: 7 degrees in occiput-C1 (p < 0.05), 5 degrees in C1-2 (p < 0.01) and 6 degrees in C2-3 (p < 0.01) respectively. Since we assume that intubation-induced excursions of the injured spine are even higher, blind oral intubation might be a safe alternative for airway management in this special group of trauma victims.",0,0
9203882,The use of paraglossal straight blade laryngoscopy in difficult tracheal intubation,"In 10 cases of unexpected difficult tracheal intubation using the Macintosh laryngoscope blade, the larynx could not be seen. In each case, a good view was achieved using the Miller blade lateral to the tongue, which enabled tracheal intubation under direct vision. The results achieved using narrow, low-profile straight laryngoscope blades with this technique are reviewed. The improved view obtained with this technique is a consequence of reduced tongue compression as compared with the Macintosh technique. This leads both to an improved line of sight, and to a reduced risk of backward displacement of the tongue and epiglottis. In addition, the molar or retromolar variation of the technique reduces the intrusion of maxillary structures into the line of sight, so that a better view of the larynx is achieved for a given degree of soft tissue compression. Paraglossal straight blade laryngoscopy may have an advantage over use of the Macintosh technique when intubation proves unexpectedly difficult. It is perhaps time to question standard teaching about the role of the curved blade in such patients or, more particularly, whether the technique of laryngoscopy as currently taught is optimal. The paraglossal straight blade technique needs to be practised in routine intubation before it can be used with confidence in difficult cases.",0,0
20535016,"A Phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine for sedation during awake fiberoptic intubation","GABA-mediated sedatives have respiratory depressant properties that may be detrimental in patients with difficult airways. In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter, Phase IIIb Food and Drug Administration study, safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine compared with placebo were evaluated as the primary sedative for awake fiberoptic intubation (AFOI). Patients were randomized to receive dexmedetomidine or saline. Patients were sedated with dexmedetomidine or rescue midazolam to achieve targeted sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥ 2) before topicalization and throughout AFOI. Primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients requiring rescue midazolam; secondary efficacy endpoints were total dose of rescue midazolam, percentage requiring additional rescue nonmidazolam medications, anesthesiologist's assessment of ease of subject care, and patient recall and satisfaction 24 hours postoperatively. Less rescue midazolam was required to maintain Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥2 (47.3% vs. 86.0%, P < 0.001), and supplemental midazolam dose was lower (1.07 ± 1.5 mg vs. 2.85 ± 3.0 mg, P < 0.001) with dexmedetomidine compared with placebo. More Mallampati Class IV patients treated with dexmedetomidine were successfully intubated without midazolam than with placebo (66.7% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.009). Dexmedetomidine decreased blood pressure and heart rate compared with placebo patients sedated with midazolam. Patients and anesthesiologists showed favorable satisfaction responses in both groups. Adverse events and patient recall were similar in both groups. Dexmedetomidine is effective as the primary sedative in patients undergoing AFOI. Some patients may require small supplemental doses of midazolam, in addition to dexmedetomidine, to achieve sufficient sedation for AFOI. Dexmedetomidine provides another AFOI option for sedation of patients with difficult airways.",0,0
