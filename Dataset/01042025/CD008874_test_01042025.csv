25885832,A clinical comparison of ketofol (ketamine and propofol admixture) versus propofol as an induction agent on quality of laryngeal mask airway insertion and hemodynamic stability in children,"Background: In spite of being the preferred induction agent for LMA insertion, propofol has many undesirable side effects including dose-related cardiorespiratory depression and local pain at injection site. Ketofol as a novel induction agent has been introduced recently with comparable efficacy and improved hemodynamic control. Objective: To investigate ketofol as a suitable induction agent alternative to propofol for insertion of LMA in children considering insertion conditions, hemodynamic stability, local pain at injection site, and recovery. Materials and methods: In this randomized, double-blind study, 100 children were randomly assigned into two groups of 50 patients each in which induction was performed with either propofol or ketofol. Providers were given one 20 ml syringe [represent either 2 mg/kg of propofol (P group) or 0.75 mg/kg of ketamine and 1.5 mg/kg of propofol (KP group)] and one 10 ml syringe for rescue if needed [represent 1 mg/kg of propofol (P group) or 0.25 mg/kg of ketamine and 0.5 mg/kg of propofol (KP group)]. After monitoring with bispectral index (BIS), general anesthesia was induced by infusion with a syringe perfuser at a constant rate of 250 ml/h with either of the two agents till the BIS values decreased to 40. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) were measured every 30 seconds up to 5 minutes after LMA placement. The time till BIS values decreased to 40 was measured. All children were evaluated for incidence of apnea, pain on injection, jaw relaxation, conditions for LMA insertion, and complications such as muscle rigidity, hallucinations, and excessive secretions. Results: Induction time (time to reach BIS of 40) was faster in the KP group (150 ± 23.5 seconds) than in the P group (205 ± 37.4 seconds). The incidence of injection pain was significantly lower in the KP group (10%) than in the P group (80%). Excellent jaw relaxation and full mouth opening were higher in the KP group [45 patients (90%)] than in the P group [38 patients (76%)]. Excellent LMA insertion conditions were observed in 45 patients (90%) in the KP group and 38 patients (76%) in the P group. The KP group showed preserved hemodynamic stability (mean blood pressure, heart rate) with less incidence and duration of apnea compared to the P group. Conclusion: ketofol is a safe and effective alternative induction agent for LMA insertion in children with rapid onset of action and lower incidence of injection pain. It provided better LMA insertion conditions, improved hemodynamic stability with less prolonged apnea when compared with propofol.",0,0
17379129,Dexmedetomidine for conscious sedation in difficult awake fiberoptic intubation cases,"Currently used methods of sedation for fiberoptic intubation such as benzodiazepines, propofol, or opioids have their limitations. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has been used clinically for its sympatholytic, analgesic, and sedative properties. We report on 4 patients with particularly difficult airways who underwent successful awake fiberoptic intubation with DEX. Dexmedetomidine was used to provide a moderate level of conscious sedation without causing respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability during fiberoptic intubation.",0,0
23020699,A randomised crossover trial comparing a single-use polyvinyl chloride laryngeal mask airway with a single-use silicone laryngeal mask airway,"We compared insertion rates of single-use polyvinyl chloride laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) vs single-use silicone LMAs in 72 anaesthetised patients. Both airways were produced by Flexicare Medical. Laryngeal mask airway insertion was successful on the first attempt in 68/72 (94%) polyvinyl chloride LMAs vs 64/72 (89%) silicone LMAs (p = 0.39). Overall insertion rates were 72/72 (100%) for the polyvinyl chloride LMAs and 71/72 (99%) for the silicone LMAs (p = 1.0). Mean (SD) insertion times were similar for polyvinyl chloride and silicone LMAs: 24.3 (5.1)s vs 24.8 (7.8)s (p = 0.64). Laryngeal mask airway position, as assessed using a fibrescope, was not different (p = 0.077). The median (IQR [range]) leak pressure was 16 (12-20 [6-30]) cmH(2) O for the polyvinyl LMA and 18 (13-22 [6-30]) cmH(2) O or the silicone LMA (p = 0.037). In conclusion, we did not find any important differences between polyvinyl chloride and silicone laryngeal mask airways.",0,0
15715633,An unusual cause of difficult intubation in a patient with a large cervical anterior osteophyte: a case report,"This report describes a case in which a large anterior osteophyte on the C2 and C3 vertebrae, due to ankylosing spondylitis, resulted in distortion of the anatomy of the upper airway and difficult intubation. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a progressive inflammatory disease, characterized by stiffening of the joints and ligaments. Stiffness of the cervical spine, atlanto-occipital, temporomandibular and cricoarytenoid joints may cause difficult intubation (1). This report describes a case in which a large anterior osteophyte on the C2 and C3 vertebrae, associated with AS, resulted in distortion of the anatomy of the upper airway and difficult intubation.",0,0
17976512,[Invasive papillary carcinoma of the thyroid associated with a voluminous laryngocele],"Objectives: To determine the value of computed tomography scan in the associated laryngeal and thyroid pathology. Material and methods: The giant laryngocele caused acute obstruction of the upper respiratory airway. Clinically, presenting symptoms includes lateral neck mass, dysphagia, cough, dyspnea. A neck CT scan is a special X-ray study that is used to examine structures located in the neck and upper chest. Results: On computed tomography (CT), a mixed (external) laryngocele appears as a well-marginated fluid-filled cystic mass in the lower submandibular space at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane. In this case, computed tomography of the neck showed an associated lesion between the larynx and the invasive thyroid tumor. The laryngocele was treated by extramucous lateral thyrotomy and the carcinoma removed through subtotal thyroidectomy. Conclusions: CT scan demonstrated its great value in the evaluation of the patient with a neck mass.",0,0
26685121,Hybrid selective surface hydrophilization and froth flotation separation of hazardous chlorinated plastics from E-waste with novel nanoscale metallic calcium composite,"Treatment by a nanometallic Ca/CaO composite has been found to selectively hydrophilize the surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), enhancing its wettability and thereby promoting its separation from E-waste plastics by means of froth flotation. The treatment considerably decreased the water contact angle of PVC, by about 18°. The SEM images of the PVC plastic after treatment displayed significant changes in their surface morphology compared to other plastics. The SEM-EDS results reveal that a markedly decrease of [Cl] concentration simultaneously with dramatic increase of [O] on the surface of the PCV samples. XPS results further confirmed an increase of hydrophilic functional groups on the PVC surface. Froth flotation at 100rpm mixing speed was found to be optimal, separating 100% of the PVC into a settled fraction of 96.4% purity even when the plastics fed into the reactor were of nonuniform size and shape. The total recovery of PVC-free plastics in E-waste reached nearly 100% in the floated fraction, significantly improved from the 20.5wt% of light plastics that can be recovered by means of conventional wet gravity separation. The hybrid method of nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment and froth flotation is effective in the separation of hazardous chlorinated plastics from E-waste plastics.",0,0
25664060,A comparison of upper airway parameters in postpartum patients: vaginal delivery vs. caesarean section,"Mallampati class has been shown to increase during labour. The influence of delivery mode on this change is not known yet. The aim of our study is to investigate the changes of upper airway parameters in parturients after caesarean section and vaginal delivery. Ninety parturients undergoing elective caesarean section and ninety parturients with vaginal delivery were enrolled. The parameters of Modified Mallampati test (MMT), inter-incisor distance, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, neck circumference were measured before labour (T0) and 1 h (T1), 6 h (T6) and 24 h (T24) after delivery. Overall, 39 parturients (45.3%) with increases in MMT class in the vaginal delivery group within 24 h After childbirth, were more than that in the caesarean section group [24 parturients (26.7%), P=0.01]. In the vaginal delivery group, the incidence of the increases in MMT class at T1 and T6 were similar, which were higher than that at T24 (P=0.015). In the caesarean section group, the incidence of MMT class increases at T6 was significantly higher than that at T1 (P=0.015) and T24 (P=0.015). Our findings indicate that increase in Mallamapti class may be more significant and may take place earlier in parturients undergoing vaginal delivery than in those undergoing elective caesarean section.",0,0
8030813,"Thyroidectomy in patients with marked thyroid enlargement: airway management, morbidity, and outcome","The medical records of 91 patients who underwent thyroidectomy from 1990 to 1993 were reviewed to evaluate airway management and operative morbidity in patients with marked thyroid enlargement. Twenty-nine patients with marked thyroid enlargement were identified: 13 unilateral, defined by a weight of > or = 40 g (mean 122 g, range 41-380 g), and 16 bilateral, defined by a weight of > or = 80 g (mean 160 g, range 82-404 g). Twenty-five patients had compressive symptomatology, 18 had tracheal narrowing and/or displacement, 19 had substernal extension, and one had superior vena cava syndrome. Unilateral vocal cord dysfunction was present in two of three patients with carcinoma and one of 26 patients with benign disease (P = 0.03). Pathology consisted of nodular goiter (11), adenoma (5), carcinoma (3), Grave's disease (5), and toxic multinodular goiter (5). All patients had an uncomplicated endotracheal intubation without the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope as predicted on the basis of preoperative laryngoscopic findings. Ease of intubation was unrelated to the extent of abnormality seen on imaging studies of the neck. Thyroidectomy alone was effective in relieving compressive symptoms with no incidence of nerve injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism, or tracheomalacia. Six (21%) of 29 patients had temporary hypocalcemia compared to eight (13%) of 62 patients with lesser thyroid enlargement (P = 0.36). One patient with an unresectable follicular carcinoma died from aspiration pneumonia three weeks following tracheostomy placement. Marked thyroid enlargement and upper airway compression is predominantly caused by benign disease; however, when there is associated recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction, carcinoma is more common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
18806036,Gum elastic bougie-guided insertion of the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway is superior to the digital and introducer tool techniques in patients with simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar,"Background: We compared three techniques for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway ProSeal (PLMA) in patients with simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar. Methods: Ninety-nine anesthetized healthy female patients aged 19-68 yr were randomly allocated for PLMA insertion using the digital, introducer tool (IT) or guided techniques. Difficult laryngoscopy was simulated using a rigid neck collar. The laryngoscopic view was graded before PLMA insertion. The digital and IT techniques were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The guided technique involved priming the drain tube with an Eschmann tracheal tube introducer, placing the introducer in the esophagus under direct vision and railroading the PLMA into position. Failed insertion was defined by any of the following criteria: 1) failed pharyngeal placement, 2) malposition, and 3) ineffective ventilation. Results: The median laryngoscopic view was 3 and the mean interincisor distance was 3.3 cm. Insertion was more frequently successful with the guided technique at the first attempt (guided 100%, digital 64%, IT 61%; P<0.0001), but success after three attempts was similar (guided 100%, digital 94%, IT 91%). The time taken for successful placement was similar among groups at the first attempt, but was shorter for the guided technique after three attempts (guided 31+/-8 s, digital 49+/-28 s, IT 54+/-37 s; P<0.02). Conclusion: The guided insertion technique is more frequently successful than the digital or IT techniques in patients with simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar.",0,0
22271280,Analysis of pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy,"Direct laryngoscopy is the most predominantly used technique in laryngology, with the fulcrum-based laryngoscope serving as the most popular instrument. The purpose of this study was to accurately calculate and measure the pressure acting on the laryngopharynx and the tongue base during microlaryngoscopy. The relationship between postoperative throat pain and the time and pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy were also investigated. Fifty patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery were included in this prospective study. Parameters that may help predict difficult laryngeal exposure were measured in the patients before microlaryngoscopy. Using static equilibrium and the law of the lever, the pressure acting on the laryngopharynx and the tongue base were calculated and related parameters were then tested for their influence on pressure. The time and pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy of each patient were compared with postoperative throat pain grade. The mean pressure was 292 ± 109 mmHg and was significantly influenced by BMI, neck circumference and full mouth opening, whereas no gender-based differences of any kind were found. The pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy was extremely high in patients with difficult laryngeal exposure (376 ± 62 mmHg), serving as a possible reason for the presence of throat pain or complications present following surgery. However, it was found that the duration of suspension laryngoscopy, not the pressure, had the most significant correlation with postoperative throat pain.",0,0
10339943,[Pulmonary tumor mass aberration into the bronchus of the intact right lung during total left lung resection],"A 77-year-old male with lung cancer underwent a total left lung resection. During surgery, there was no ventilatory trouble such as hypoventilation or hypoxia. However, a mass was found in the right main bronchus by endobronchial fiberscopy before extubation. Because the mass could not be aspirated through the endobronchial fiberscope, we extracted it using basket-foreceps. We speculated that surgical procedures may have caused the tumor mass to move to the bronchus of the contralateral intact lung. Accordingly, fiberscopic examination of the airway before extubation should be mandatory, even if there is no ventilatory trouble during lung resection.",0,0
17205884,Lightwand-assisted nasotracheal intubation in awake ankylosing spondylitis,"Several techniques of airway management in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been reported. No study related specifically to the use of a lightwand-assisted intubation in AS has been previously described. The present case report demonstrates that an awake, nasotracheal intubation can be successfully performed to provide general anesthesia in a patient with AS. A 65-year-old Thai male was scheduled for exploratory surgery under general anesthesia. Past medical history consisted of hypertension and AS. The preoperative airway assessment showed limitation of mouth opening, an extremely anteriorly flexed and immobile cervical spine. An awake intubation under sedation and topical airway anesthesia were chosen. Multiple attempts at blind nasotracheal intubation and oral approach with lightwand were unsuccessful. Finally, intubation was successfully performed with lightwand by nasal route. This serves to show that an awake nasotracheal intubation with a lightwand may be a safe and useful alternative option for airway management in patients with severe ankylosing spondylitis.",0,0
26279410,Use of rotational angiography in assessing relationship of the airway to vasculature during cardiac catheterization,"Objectives: We are the first to describe the use of three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) in creating multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and volume rendering, in the catheterization suite, of airways at risk for compression by adjacent cardiac structures. Background: 3DRA has emerged as a promising tool for improved visualization of cardiac and vascular structures in congenital heart disease. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all available cases at our institution in which MPR from 3DRA was used to assess airways in relation to surrounding cardiovascular structures. Results: Eight cases were reviewed from January 1, 2011 to November 30, 2013. Seven children had complex biventricular anatomy, including repaired truncus arteriosus, repaired absent pulmonary valve, repaired double outlet right ventricle, and vascular rings. One child had double inlet left ventricle and had undergone a hybrid procedure (stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus and banding of bilateral pulmonary arteries) before the Glenn procedure. Six of these cases involved distortion or stenosis of the pulmonary conduit or branch pulmonary arteries. In all cases, the trachea and the main bronchi were clearly visualized using MPR. Management was affected by the visualization of the airways during the catheterization procedure in seven of eight cases. Four cases had intraprocedural bronchoscopy that confirmed airway findings seen by MPR. In one case, computed tomography confirmed left bronchial compression seen by MPR. Conclusions: 3DRA can visualize airway anatomy and its relationship to the vasculature accurately. This has significant implications for preinterventional planning, intraprocedural management, as well as postprocedural recovery.",0,0
8209984,Apparent massive tongue swelling. A complication of orotracheal intubation on the Intensive Care Unit,"The trachea of an 81-year-old woman was intubated with an orotracheal tube for emergency abdominal surgery and the tube was left in place for postoperative management on the Intensive Care Unit. After 36 h, she developed apparent massive tongue swelling. On closer examination, a normal sized tongue was found to be displayed by oedema of the floor of the mouth and submandibular space, secondary to purulent sialadenitis from right submandibular duct obstruction by the tracheal tube.",0,0
9515844,Preoperative bronchoscopic assessment of airway invasion by esophageal cancer: a prospective study,"Background: Bronchoscopy is frequently used to assess invasion of esophageal cancer into the tracheobronchial tree. Prospective studies evaluating the role of bronchoscopy in pretherapeutic staging of esophageal cancer are lacking. Study objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of fiberoptic bronchoscopy for the assessment of airway involvement by esophageal carcinoma and its resectability. Patients and methods: In a prospective study, we analyzed 150 bronchoscopies in 116 consecutive patients with potentially operable esophageal carcinoma, and correlated the findings with other staging modalities, intraoperative evaluation, and histopathologic data. Results: One unknown additional bronchial cancer was found. In 32% of bronchoscopies performed in patients with esophageal cancer located above the tracheal bifurcation, some macroscopic abnormality was detected in the trachea and main bronchi, with mobile protrusion of the posterior tracheal wall being the most frequent abnormality (20.7%). When compared with histologic results, normal macroscopic appearance of the trachea and main bronchi had a negative predictive value of 98.5%, but the positive predictive value of all macroscopic abnormalities for the diagnosis of airway involvement was low, particularly after radiation therapy. The overall accuracy of bronchoscopy with multiple brush cytology and biopsy sampling in proving or excluding airway invasion in patients with otherwise operable conditions was 95.8% (95% confidence interval, 88.3 to 99.1%). Bronchoscopy was the sole decisive staging procedure, resulting in exclusion from surgery because of airway invasion, in 9.7% of patients with otherwise potentially operable conditions. The results of bronchoscopy and CT were discordant in 40% of the patients; the specificity and positive predictive value were higher for bronchoscopy than for CT. Conclusions: When performed as the last investigation in the staging workup, bronchoscopy with biopsy and brush cytology is a very accurate procedure in evaluating possible airway invasion of esophageal cancer; macroscopic findings alone are not reliable.",0,0
16492835,"Predictive performance of three multivariate difficult tracheal intubation models: a double-blind, case-controlled study","We performed a case-controlled, double-blind study to examine the performance of three multivariate clinical models (Wilson, Arné, and Naguib models) in the prediction of unanticipated difficult intubation. The study group consisted of 97 patients in whom an unanticipated difficult intubation had occurred. For each difficult intubation patient, a matched control patient was selected in whom tracheal intubation had been easily accomplished. Postoperatively, a blinded investigator evaluated both patients. The clinical assessment included the patient's weight, height, age, Mallampati score, interincisor gap, thyromental distance, thyrosternal distance, neck circumference, Wilson risk sum score, history of previous difficult intubation, and diseases associated with difficult laryngoscopy or intubation. The Naguib model was significantly more sensitive (81.4%; P < 0.0001) than the Arné (54.6%) or Wilson (40.2%) models. Both the Naguib (76.8%) and Arné (74.7%) model classified more intubations correctly (P = 0.01) than the Wilson model (66.5%). The specificity of Arné, Wilson, and Naguib model was 94.9%, 92.8%, and 72.2%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87, 0.79, and 0.82, respectively. Our new model for prediction of difficult intubation was developed using logistic regression and includes thyromental distance, Mallampati score, interincisor gap, and height. This model is 82.5% sensitive and 85.6% specific with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90.",1,1
23493414,Comparison of clinical performance of the I-gel with LMA proseal,"Aim: To compare insertion characteristics of 2 different supraglottic devices [I-gel and Proseal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA)] and to observe any associated complications. Study design: This prospective, randomized study was conducted in 80 patients [Group I - I-gel insertion (n = 40) and Group P - LMA Proseal insertion (n =40)] of ASA grades I/II, of either sex in the age group 18-65 years. Both groups were compared with respect to ease of insertion, insertion attempts, fiberoptic assessment, airway sealing pressure, ease of gastric tube placement, and other complications. Materials and methods: All patients were asked to fast overnight. Patients were given alprazolam 0.25 mg orally at 10 p.m. the night before surgery and again 2 hours prior to surgery with 1-2 sips of water. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg, and ranitidine 50 mg were administered intravenously to the patients 45 minutes prior to the surgery. Once adequate depth of anesthesia was achieved either of the 2 devices, selected using a random computerized table, was inserted by an experienced anesthesiologist. In group I, I-gel was inserted and in patients of group P, PLMA was inserted. Statistical analysis: Student t-test and Mann-Whitney test were employed to compare the means; for categorical variables, Chi-square test was used. Result: Mean insertion time for the I-gel (11.12 ± 1.814 sec) was significantly lower than that of the PLMA (15.13 ± 2.91 sec) (P = 0.001). I-gel was easier to insert with a better anatomic fit. Mean airway sealing pressure in the PLMA group (29.55 ± 3.53 cm H2O) was significantly higher than in the I-gel group (26.73 ± 2.52 cm H2O; P = 0.001). Ease of gastric tube insertion was significantly higher in the I-gel group (P = 0.001). Incidence of blood staining of the device, sore throat and dysphagia were observed more in PLMA group. No other complications were observed in either of the groups.",0,0
8793918,Airway management for pediatric emergencies,"Several factors increase the difficulty and urgency of airway management in children in the emergency setting. Early and appropriate airway management are of prime importance in improving the outcome of such patients. The major decision points of airway management include one's assessment of the airway and ability to perform endotracheal intubation. If the airway is judged to be normal, oral endotracheal intubation following sedation and neuromuscular blockade is suggested. Rapid sequence intubation to prevent acid aspiration should be used. While the medications for airway management generally are administered intravenously, it should be kept in mind that intraosseous access is an acceptable alternative for the administration of several different agents, including those used for endotracheal intubation. If the airway cannot be secured following the administration of anesthetic and neuromuscular blocking agents, the ASA algorithm for the ""cannot intubate/cannot ventilate"" scenario should be followed (Figure). When the airway is judged to be abnormal, one of the above described awake techniques may be used. While there is ample literature concerning these techniques in adults, their use in children has been limited. Most importantly, considerable practice may be required to become and stay facile with many of these ""alternative techniques"" of airway management. In certain circumstances, surgical cricothyrotomy should be considered as an alternative to airway management. Regardless of the technique chosen, appropriate personnel and preparation are mandatory to ensure the safe and effective management of the airway in the pediatric trauma patient. Due to the various skills and expertise of different subspecialists, a multidisciplinary approach to such patients is recommended. Such an approach may include pediatricians, emergency room physicians, surgical subspecialists, anesthesiologists, and critical care physicians.",0,0
10217547,Effects of dexamethasone on airway hyper-responsiveness to the adenosine A1 receptor agonist cyclo-pentyl adenosine in an allergic rabbit model,"1. New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were immunized within 24 h of birth with Alternaria tenuis in aluminium hydroxide (Al (OH)3) (i.p.) or sham immunized (saline plus Al (OH)3 i.p.) and subsequently injected with the allergen (i.p.) or sham-immunized for the next 3 months. At 3 months of age, baseline airway responsiveness was assessed using cyclo-pentyl adenosine (CPA). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in all animals and samples of peripheral blood were collected from some animals for estimation of dexamethasone levels. In some animals, blood was collected at the end of the experiment and cellular function was assessed by measurement of ex vivo proliferation of mononuclear cells in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). 2. Allergen immunization significantly increased baseline airway responsiveness to inhaled CPA (P<0.05) in comparison with sham-immunized animals, at 3 months after immunization. Dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) treatment for 1 month did not modify this established airway hyper-responsiveness to CPA. Dexamethasone treatment did not affect either total or differential cell numbers in BAL fluid during the 4 week period, although significant plasma levels of dexamethasone were achieved in dexamethasone treated animals. 3. Treatment of rabbits with dexamethasone (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.), 6 h prior to each allergen injection from the neonatal stage, significantly reduced baseline airway hyper-responsiveness to CPA measured at 3 months (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in either total or differential cell numbers in BAL fluid, or any difference in mitogen-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells between dexamethasone and vehicle treated rabbits. 4. These results suggest that introduction of glucocorticosteroids in early life can prevent baseline airway hyper-responsiveness to inhaled CPA in allergic rabbits. However, once established, such underlying airway hyper-responsiveness is difficult to resolve, even with prolonged treatment with glucocorticosteroids.",0,0
24918851,Is the anesthesiologist actually prepared for loss of airway or respiratory function? A cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary hospital,"Objective: To identify compliance with the procedures for securing the airway of patients submitted to anesthesia, defined as highly recommended in the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted with 87 patients aged 18 to 60 years, classified as ASA grade 1 or 2 according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status Classification. The study variables consisted of: whether the Mallampati test had been performed, whether equipment was readily available for orotracheal intubation, whether the correct placement of the endotracheal tube was verified, whether patient ventilation was monitored and whether fasting was confirmed. Prevalence ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated as measures of relative risk. Statistical significance was defined at 5%. Results: It was found that in 87.4% of patients, the airway was not evaluated using the Mallampati classification and in 51.7% of cases, preoperative fasting was not confirmed. In 29.9% of cases, the ready availability of equipment for orotracheal intubation was not verified. In all of the cases in which the availability of this equipment was not checked, the patient was submitted to regional anesthesia, with a statistically significant difference compared to the cases in which the patient was submitted to general anesthesia. Conclusion: Measures considered essential for the safety of the patient during surgery are still being ignored.",0,0
9052311,The effect of goiter on endotracheal intubation,"The incidence of difficulty in tracheal intubation in the presence of goiter was investigated. Data were collected in a series of 4742 consecutive adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. The prevalence of goiter was 6.8%. Fifteen anesthesiologists performed the preoperative airway assessment using standardized guidelines. Seven individual risk factors were correlated with the potential for difficult tracheal intubation. Whenever evidence of goiter or airway pathology was observed, the evaluation was completed by indirect laryngoscopy and radiologic examination to establish the presence of any anatomical deviation. Difficult intubation was defined as inadequate exposure of the glottis by direct laryngoscopy. There was no difference in probability of difficulty in tracheal intubation between patients who presented for thyroidectomy and patients with goiter estimated as a random finding. Statistical analysis revealed an increased risk of difficult intubation amongst goiter patients compared with patients with no evidence of any risk factor (6.8% vs 0.9%, P < 10(-8), relative risk = 7.4). We conclude that goiter, when accompanied by airway deformity, constitutes an aggravating factor for difficult intubation.",0,0
26849245,Anatomical location of the vocal cords in relation to cervical vertebrae: A new predictor of difficult laryngoscopy?,"Background: Several anatomical factors, such as prognathism, sex, short thyromental distance and others are known to make direct laryngoscopy difficult. Objective: We investigated the hypothesis that the anatomical position of the vocal cords in relation to the cervical vertebrae correlates with difficult laryngoscopy. Existing MRI was used to identify the position of the vocal cords relative to the cervical spine in patients with and without difficult laryngoscopy. Design: Observational study with adaptive enrichment. Setting: University hospital. Patients: A total of 142 adult patients, 91 with easy (Cormack-Lehane class 1 or 2) and 51 with difficult (Cormack-Lehane class 3 or 4) laryngoscopy. Main outcome measures: Position of the vocal cords relative to cervical vertebrae in patients with easy vs. difficult laryngoscopy. Results: In patients with difficult laryngoscopy, we found a higher incidence of cranial position of the vocal cords in relation to the cervical spine compared with patients with easy laryngoscopy (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Anaesthesiologists should take advantage of existing imaging of the cervical spine when assessing the patient's airway.",0,0
23471156,Biomimetic metal oxides for the extraction of nanoparticles from water,"Contamination of nanomaterials in the environment will pose significant health risks in the future. A viable purification method is necessary to address this problem. Here we report the synthesis and application of a series of metal oxides prepared using a biological template for the removal of nanoparticles from the aqueous environment. A simple synthesis of metal oxides such as ZnO, NiO, CuO, Co3O4 and CeO2 employing eggshell membrane (ESM) as a biotemplate is reported. The morphology of the metal oxide powders was characterized using electron microscopes and the lattice structure was established using X-ray diffraction methods. Extraction of nanoparticles from water was carried out to compare the efficiency of metal oxides. NiO showed good extraction efficiency in removing gold and silver nanoparticles from spiked water samples within an hour. Easy access and enhanced stability of metal oxides makes them interesting candidates for applications in industrial effluent treatments and water purifications.",0,0
15316231,Use of morphological indicators to predict outcomes of palatopharyngeal surgery in patients with obstructive sleep apnea,"There is no consensus on how to quantify the abnormality of upper airway structures in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This research aimed to use morphological indicators as clinical predictors to correlate morphological stage and surgical results in OSA patients. One hundred and five patients with OSA received palatopharyngeal surgery, i.e. extended uvulopalatal flap (EUPF). Morphological indicators including modified Mallampati grade (MMP), tonsil size, and body mass index were used to stage OSA patients preoperatively. Change of respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was used to monitor change of sleep apnea events. Success rates were compared among patients of different morphological stages. One year after EUPF, the success rates of EUPF in stage I, II, and III patients were 100, 92.9 and 61.4%, respectively. Change of RDI was significantly correlated with MMP and tonsil size. MMP and tonsil size were predictive of the change of RDI (R(2) = 0.29). Morphological stage may serve as a reliable selection criterion for patients undergoing EUPF surgery and can significantly predict the change of sleep apnea events following EUPF surgery.",0,0
27482317,Difficult endotracheal intubation secondary to tracheal deviation and stenosis in a patient with severe kyphoscoliosis: a case report,"We report on a case of difficult endotracheal intubation in a patient with marked tracheal deviation at an angle of 90 degrees combined with stenosis due to kyphoscoliosis with vertebral body fusion. After induction of general anesthesia, a proper laryngeal view was easily obtained using a videolaryngoscope. But a tracheal tube could not be advanced more than 3 cm beyond the vocal cords due to resistance, despite various attempts, including the use of small size tubes, full rotation of the tube tip, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Ultimately, the airway was successfully secured by placing a tube tip above the area of resistance and by additionally packing saline-soaked gauzes around the tracheal inlet to minimize gas leakage and to fasten the tube in the trachea.",0,0
15684263,Glottic insertion of the ProSeal LMA occurs in 6% of cases: a review of 627 patients,"Purpose: Glottic insertion of the ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway (PLMA) has received little attention in the anesthesiology literature. We investigated the incidence and depth of insertion associated with this important cause for a failed insertion attempt with the PLMA. Methods: With Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed 15-months' use of the PLMA. Diagnosis of glottic insertion involved a test with children's bubble solution placed on the drain tube port, as well as a fibreoptic examination of the airway of patients experiencing airway obstruction. Patients were anesthetized and paralyzed and the PLMA was inserted deflated with the fingertip method (women size 4, men size 5). The cuff was inflated and a soap membrane established on the drain tube port. Glottic insertion was diagnosed by applying fingertip pressure to the patient's chest wall and observing pulmonary exhalation via the drain tube and bubble formation. The PLMA was then removed and reinserted without further assessment. For all patients, we used a fibrescope to determine the cause of unexplained airway obstruction after the PLMA was considered successfully inserted. Results: There were 627 patients (391 women, 236 men). We diagnosed glottic insertion in 38/627 (6.1%) patients, 37 by the soap membrane test and one with airway obstruction and direct fibreoptic visualization of malposition. Following glottic insertion, successful reinsertion of the PLMA behind the larynx was always associated with greater depth of insertion by an average 2.0 cm. Conclusion: Glottic insertion can be easily and quickly diagnosed and our results suggest the incidence and importance of malposition are under-reported in the literature.",0,0

23931251,Difficult airway intubation with flexible bronchoscope,"Background and objective: To describe the efficacy and safety of a flexible bronchoscopy intubation (FBI) protocol in patients with difficult airway. Method: We reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with difficult airway who underwent flexible bronchoscopy intubation under spontaneous ventilation and sedation with midazolam and fentanyl from March 2009 to December 2010. Results: The study enrolled 102 patients, 69 (67.7%) men and 33 (32.3%) women, with a mean age of 44 years. FBI was performed in 59 patients (57.8%) with expected difficult airway in the operating room, in 39 patients (38.2%) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and in 4 patients (3.9%) in the emergency room. Cough, decrease in transient oxygen saturation, and difficult progression of the cannula through the larynx were the main complications, but these factors did not prevent intubation. Conclusion: FBI according to the conscious sedation protocol with midazolam and fentanyl is effective and safe in the management of patients with difficult airway.",0,0
15814760,[Propofol sedation allows awake intubation of the difficult airway with the Fastrach LMA],"Purpose: To evaluate target controlled infusion anesthesia (TCI) with propofol for conscious intubation [(Ramsay score equal to 3 (RS 3)] through the Fastrach laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Methods: 17 consenting and unpremedicated patients, who showed criteria for difficult intubation (score developed by Arne et al. > or = 11), were monitored and received supplemental oxygen. Propofol was administered by TCI, with successive targets of 0.6 and 1 microg x mL(-1), while the RS was evaluated: if = 3, LMA intubation was attempted, if < 3 the TCI was increased by steps of 0.2 microg x mL(-1) until an RS of 3 was reached. Local anesthesia (lidocaine 5%) of the oropharynx was carried out at 0.6 and 1 microg x mL(-1), together with local anesthesia of the nasopharynx at 1 microg x mL(-1). A standardized questionnaire evaluated memory of and satisfaction with the technique (score/10) on postoperative day 1. Results: The LMA was inserted in 100% of cases and intubation was successful in 16 out of 17 cases (one failure). The propofol target concentration to obtain a RS of 3 was 1.25 +/- 0.07 microg x mL(-1). Amnesia occurred as soon as the target concentration of propofol exceeded 1 microg x mL(-1). The patients found the technique very satisfactory (median satisfaction score = 9.4/10). Incidents of coughing or nausea were observed in 47% and 5% of cases respectively. There was no oesophageal intubation and no desaturation (SpO2 < 95%). Conclusion: Propofol administered by TCI to achieve a RS of 3 allows conscious intubation to be performed through a LMA under satisfactory conditions. A LMA could be a possible alternative to a ""conscious"" fibroscopy.",0,0

25886420,Facing the airway challenges in maxillofacial trauma: A retrospective review of 288 cases at a level i trauma center,"Background: Maxillofacial trauma is an apt example of a difficult airway. The anesthesiologist faces challenges in their management at every step from airway access to maintenance of anesthesia and extubation and postoperative care. Methods: A retrospective study was done of 288 patients undergoing surgery for maxillofacial trauma over a period of five years. Demographic data, detailed airway assessment and the method of airway access were noted. Trauma scores, mechanism of injury, duration of hospital stay, requirement of ventilator support were also recorded. Complications encountered during perioperative anaesthetic management were noted. Results: 259 (89.93%) of the patients were male and 188 (62.85%) were in the 21-40 year range. 97.57% of the cases were operated electively. 206 (71.53%) patients were injured in motor vehicular accidents. 175 (60.76%) had other associated injuries. Mean Glasgow coma scale score (GCS), injury severity score (ISS) and revised trauma score (RTS) were 14.18, 14.8 and 12, respectively. Surgery was performed almost nine days following injury. The mean duration of hospitalization was 16 days. ICU admission was required in 22 patients with mean duration of ICU stay being two days. Majority of patients had difficult airway. 240 (83.33%) patients were intubated in the operating room and fibreoptic guided intubation was done in 159 (55.21%) patients. Submental intubation was done in 45 (14.93%) cases. Conclusions: Maxillofacial injuries present a complex challenge to the anaesthesiologist. The fibreoptic bronchoscope is the main weapon available in our arsenal. The submental technique scores over the time-honored tracheostomy. Communication between the anaesthesiologist and the surgeon must be given paramount importance.",0,0
23798919,A study to investigate the relationship between difficult intubation and prediction criterion of difficult intubation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Background and aim: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is predisposed to the development of upper airway obstruction during sleep, and it poses considerable problem for anesthetic management. Difficult intubation (DI) is an important problem for management of anesthesia. In this clinical research, we aim to investigate the relationship between DI and prediction criteria of DI in cases with OSA. Materials and methods: We studied 40 [OSA (Group O, n = 20) and non-OSA, (Group C, n = 20)] ASA I-II, adult patients scheduled tonsillectomy under general anesthesia. Same anesthetic protocol was used in two groups. Intubation difficulties were assessed by Mallampati grading, Wilson sum score, Laryngoscopic grading (Cormack and Lehane), a line joining the angle of the mouth and tragus of the ear with the horizontal, sternomental distance, and tyromental distance. Demographic properties, time-dependent hemodynamic variables, doses of reversal agent, anesthesia and operation times, and recovery parameters were recorded. Results: Significant difference was detected between groups in terms of BMI, Mallampati grading, Wilson weight scores, Laryngoscopic grading, sternomental distance, tyromental distance, doses of reversal agent, and recovery parameters. Conclusion: OSA patient's DI ratio is higher than that of non-OSA patients. BMI Mallampati grading, Wilson weight scores, Laryngoscopic grading, sternomental distance, and tyromental distance evaluation might be predictors for DI in patients with OSA.",0,0
10447900,Hemifacial microsomia: anatomical prediction of difficult intubation,"Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is associated with a difficult airway. We hypothesized that a difficult intubation would be predicted by radiographic evaluation of the severity of mandibular hypoplasia. A retrospective review of anaesthetic and surgical records of 102 children with HFM from 1986 to 1996 was conducted for radiographic classification of mandibular hypoplasia and degree of difficulty with intubation. Intubation was classified as Grade A-easy, Grade B-difficult, or Grade C-very difficult. The mandibular anatomy was categorized as Type I-'mini-mandible', Type II-abnormal condylar size and shape, or Type III-absent ramus, condyle, and temporomandibular joint. In the 82 patients with HFM, 70% were classified as Grade A, 21% had Grade B and 9% had Grade C airways. No patients with Type I mandible had Grade C airway, while 25% of the patients with Type III mandible had Grade C airway. The correlation of the degree of airway difficulty with mandibular type was significant (P=0.001). In 20 patients with bilateral mandibular hypoplasia, 30% had Grade A, 35% had Grade B, and 35% had Grade C airways. We conclude that radiographic classification of mandibular deformity is a useful adjunct for preoperative prediction of airway difficulty in the management of children with unilateral HFM.",0,0
11943531,"Difficult airway management in a patient with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure","We report a patient with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure in whom awake fiberoptic intubation was performed because the patient's mouth opening was insufficient as a result of disc prolapse of the mandibular joint. We planned to perform this procedure during conscious sedation, spontaneous respiration, and with stable hemodynamic parameters (no tachycardia, hypertension, or hypotension). After oral premedication with dikaliumclorazepate, the patient received clonidine. Fiberoptic intubation was performed while the patient breathed spontaneously. Throughout the procedure, no adverse events occurred. Clonidine is a valuable adjunct for conscious sedation and can be used safely for sympathicolysis, even in patients with aortic stenosis.",0,0
9052310,Clinical trial of a new device for fiberoptic orotracheal intubation (Augustine Scope),"Blind oral intubation using the Augustine Guide is helpful for intubating the trachea of patients presenting with difficult airways. This device has been modified by adding a fiberoptic scope with a built-in battery-powered light. We studied this Augustine Scope in 104 patients (Group AS) and compared the results with 96 patients managed by direct laryngoscopy (Group DL). No significant differences in Mallampati class, thyromental distance, laryngoscopic view, and patients height or weight were observed between the two groups. The Augustine Scope provided conditions for successful intubation in 102 of 104 patients (98%), compared with a 97% success rate in the group where DL was used. The three patients who failed DL were successfully intubated with AS. The mean +/- SD time needed to perform intubation was 19 +/- 10 s in Group AS and 21 +/- 13 s in Group DL (P = not significant). No traumatizing effects were observed. We conclude that the Augustine Scope is an effective and safe device for orotracheal intubation in routine and difficult airways.",0,0
7573868,A prospective study of anaesthesia for quinsy tonsillectomy,"A prospective study of 50 adult quinsy tonsillectomy anaesthetics was performed. There were no significant anaesthetic or surgical complications and the mean intra-operative blood loss was 176 ml. The Mallampati score did not correlate with the Cormack and Lehane glottic view and there were no difficult intubations. Pre-operative trismus resolved completely during induction in 77.4% of cases. We concluded that the Mallampati grading system is not applicable in quinsies and in cases with palatopharyngeal arch distortion, that trismus in quinsies is due to muscle spasm and resolves completely during induction in most cases and that pre-anaesthetic drainage of the abscess together with rehydration and antibiotics are important contributing factors to safe anaesthesia for quinsy.",0,0
19860233,[Difficult tracheal intubation using airway scope in a pediatric patient with Hunter syndrome],"Hunter syndrome, manifested by mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), is a hereditary disorder caused by accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. An important issue in regard to anesthesia in affected individuals is airway management, because of gargoylism. An 8-year-old boy with MPS II was scheduled for adenotonsillectomy. We performed slow induction with sevoflurane, then utilized an Airway Scope (AWS; HOYA Corporation Tokyo, Japan), which enables operators to observe tube passage through the vocal cords with an LCD monitor, for tracheal intubation, because intubation guided by a fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was considered to be risky for glottic damage. Attempted tracheal intubations with the AWS alone and in combination with an FOB inserted through the tracheal tube failed, even though a clear image of the glottis was obtained. Finally, we inserted a stylet into the tracheal tube attached to the blade of the AWS and successful tracheal intubation was accomplished. The operation was completed uneventfully and the patient entered the ICU with his trachea intubated, because of pharyngeal and laryngeal edema. Although useful for difficult airway management, tracheal intubation with the AWS may be difficult when used in patients with a narrow oral cavity or small tracheal tube.",0,0
1489129,Aerosolized beclomethasone in chronic bronchitis. Improved pulmonary function and diminished airway inflammation,"Chronic bronchitis is associated with airways obstruction and inflammation. In order to determine whether aerosolized beclomethasone can modulate airway inflammation and diminish airway obstruction, subjects with chronic bronchitis performed spirometry and underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) before and after receiving 6 wk of therapy (five puffs four times a day) with either aerosolized beclomethasone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. All subjects received aerosolized albuterol before each use of the study medications. Before BAL, the airways were visually assessed for the appearance of inflammation and assigned a score, the bronchitis index. BAL was performed by instilling five 20-ml aliquots of saline into each of three sites and pooling and separately analyzing the returns from the first aliquots to yield a ""bronchial sample."" The bronchial lavages were repeated in an additional three sites to increase the volume of fluid available for analysis. The fluid was prepared for cytologic examination by cytocentrifugation. Albumin (as a measure of epithelium permeability) and lactoferrin and lysozyme (as measures of serous cell activity) were measured in unconcentrated BAL fluid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and concentrations in epithelial lining fluid were estimated using urea as an internal marker for dilution. After treatment, the beclomethasone group, but not the placebo group, showed improvement in FVC (p = 0.02), FEV1 (p = 0.002), and 25 to 75% forced expiratory flow (p = 0.006). Associated with the improvement in spirometry, the bronchitis index fell (13.5 +/- 1.0 versus 10.75 +/- 1.1, p = 0.02) in the beclomethasone-treated group, but not the placebo-treated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
24601120,[Boy with Coffin-Lowry syndrome associated with spinal cord injuries],"A 12-year-old male patient with Coffin-Lowry syndrome was scheduled for posterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical spinal injuries. The patient had features of Coffin-Lowry syndrome including mental retardation, prominent forehead, a short nose with a wide tip, a wide mouth with full lips, short stature, microcephaly, and kyphoscoliosis. We anticipated major troubles related to anesthesia such as difficult ventilation and intubation, communication difficulty during induction and extubation, and difficulty in using a naso-pharyngeal airway. In addition, we had to stabilize neck alignments during intubation because cervical vertebrae were unstable and spinal cord has already been injured. Therefore, we scheduled slow induction with sevoflurane maintaining spontaneous respiration. As we found the full mouth opening of the patient after the induction, we inserted an intubating laryngeal mask, through which ventilation was successfully maintained. A tracheal tube was inserted through the intubating laryngeal mask. When the surgery was completed, we extubated using a tube introducer in the trachea. As we found that the patient's airway was open, we removed the introducer. In conclusion, with a thorough planning of the anesthetic management, we successfully managed anesthesia for cervical spinal surgery in a patient with Coffin-Lowry syndrome.",0,0

8042812,What is the best way to determine oropharyngeal classification and mandibular space length to predict difficult laryngoscopy?,"Background: Previous studies have suggested that the degree of visibility of oropharyngeal structures (OP class) and mandibular space (MS) length can predict difficult laryngoscopy. However, those studies were either inconsistent or omit description of how to perform these tests with regard to body, head and tongue position, and the use of phonation, hyoid versus thyroid cartilage and inside versus outside of the mentum. The purpose of this investigation was to determine which method of testing best predicts difficult laryngoscopy. Methods: In each of 213 consenting adults the OP class was determined in 24 method combinations: two body positions (sitting and supine), three head positions (neutral, sniff, and full extension), two tongue positions (in and out), and with and without phonation. In each patient MS length was measured in 24 method combinations: two body positions (sitting and supine), three head positions (neutral, sniff, and full extension), two distal end points (hyoid and thyroid cartilage), and two proximal end points (inside and outside of the mentum). In each patient the laryngoscopic grade was determined at the time of induction of anesthesia. We defined laryngoscopic grades III (n = 24) and 4 (n = 0) as difficult. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area) for each combination was used to compare the combinations and determine significant differences: ROC area = 0.5 implied a totally uninformative combination and ROC area = 1.0 a combination that predicted perfectly. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate a predictor of difficult intubation that combined both OP class and MS length (the performance index). The performance index could then be used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and probability of difficult intubation. Results: The ROC areas for the different combinations used to assess OP class ranged from 0.78 to 0.94. The best combination was with the patient sitting, head in extension, tongue out, and with or without phonation. For MS length, the ROC areas ranged from 0.58 to 0.77; the best combination was the patient sitting, with the head in extension, with distance measured from the inside of the mentum to the thyroid cartilage. Combining the OP class and MS length (performance index = 2.5 X OP class - MS length in centimeters) significantly increased predictability of difficult intubation. At performance index = 0 and = 2, the probability of difficult intubation was 3.5% and 24%, respectively. With clinically relevant cutpoints for the performance index it was found that most difficult intubations could be predicted, but approximately half of those predicted to be difficult would in fact be easy. Conclusions: Based on the above ROC areas and ease of performing the test for the patient, we recommend that these tests be performed with patients in the sitting position, with the head in full extension, the tongue out, and with phonation, and with distance measured from the thyroid cartilage to inside of the mentum. Nevertheless, it is clear that these two tests, either used alone or in combination, will fail to predict a few difficult laryngoscopies and that they will predict difficult laryngoscopy in a significant number of patients in whom the trachea is easy to intubate.",0,0
22643044,Performance of emergency physicians utilizing a video-assisted semi-rigid fiberoptic stylet for intubation of a difficult airway in a high-fidelity simulated patient: a pilot study,"Background: This study was designed to evaluate emergency physician success and satisfaction using a video-assisted semi-rigid fiberoptic stylet, the Clarus Video System (CVS), during a simulated difficult airway scenario. Findings: Emergency physicians (EPs) of all levels were first shown a brief slide show and three example videos, and then given 20 min to practice intubating a mannequin using both the CVS and standard direct laryngoscopy (DL). The mannequin was then placed in a c-collar and set to simulate an apneic patient with an edematous tongue and trismus. Each EP was given up to three timed attempts with each technique. They rated their satisfaction with the CVS, usefulness for their practice, and the effectiveness of the tutorial. Direct laryngoscopy had a 65% success rate on the first attempt, 20% on the second, and 15% required three or more. The CVS had a 100% success rate with a single attempt. Average time for independent DL attempts was 43.41 s (SD = ±26.82) and 38.71 s (SD = ±34.14) with CVS. Cumulative attempt times were analyzed and compared (DL = 74.55 ± 68.40 s and CVS = 38.71 ± 34.14 s; p = 0.028). EPs rated their satisfaction with, and usefulness of, the CVS as ≥6 out of 10.

All scheduled patients were included. Induction and tracheal intubation were carried out as usual. Intubation was deemed to have been difficult if any special procedure had been required (external compression excepted); difficult laryngoscopy was defined as grade 3 or 4 on the Cormack-Lehane scale. In accordance with these criteria, less than 36% of patients with difficult intubation or laryngoscopy were detected, with a high false positive rate (more than 75%) but a good negative predictive value (more than 90%). This study was not concordant with the results of the original studies. However, data from literature show a great variability of results between studies. Many factors may contribute to this variability: differences between samples of patients, evaluation of Mallampati or Wilson scale, protocols of induction and intubation or characterization of difficult intubation.

She had been diagnosed as rhabdomyosarcoma of her neck at 5 years of age, and received tumor resection and chemoradiotherapy. Afterwards, she was suffering from dysphagia as a late complication of radiotherapy. She received laryngeal elevation surgery at 24 years of age, in order to improve swallowing disturbance. With rapid induction of anesthesia, she was easily ventilated with mask and bag. However, it was difficult to visualize her vocal cord with various intubating apparatus, because of her mandible hypoplasia, small oral cavity, and laryngeal elevation. After all, we were able to intubate her trachea using Pentax Airway-scope® (AWS) with a Pediatric-type INTLOCK Blade™ (ITL-P). Radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy at childhood causes various late complications, leading to difficult intubation. Meanwhile, laryngeal elevation surgery for dysphagia anatomically makes intubation more difficult An adult who has such past history should be expected as an extremely difficult intubation case, and we must be prepared with various intubating apparatus including AWS with ITL-P.",0,0
19825054,The use of mandibular nerve block to predict safe anaesthetic induction in patients with acute trismus,"Acute trismus can be caused by pain, muscle spasm, swelling or mechanical obstruction. Unfortunately, the cause is not always obvious during pre-operative airway assessment. In this pilot study, we prospectively evaluated mandibular nerve block as a pre-operative tool to identify patients with reversible causes of trismus, namely pain or spasm, in order to allow safe anaesthetic induction. Six patients with unilateral fractured mandibles and trismus received a mandibular nerve block before induction of general anaesthesia. There was an increase in maximal inter-incisor gap after the blocks (median (range) distance: pre-block 16.5 (14-30) and post-block 34 (32-35) mm; p = 0.027), and no further improvement after induction of general anaesthesia (post-induction 37 (30-40) mm; p = 0.276 compared with post-block). There was an improvement in pain scores (p = 0.027), and no side-effects were detected. Pre-operative mandibular nerve blockade appears to reverse trismus caused by pain and muscle spasm, allowing the anaesthetist to decide whether awake intubation is genuinely indicated.",0,0
24971572,Use of a simple clinical tool for airway assessment to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes,"Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that maternal Mallampati class (MC), as a marker for OSA, is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Study design: We performed a retrospective secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of term births (≥ 37 weeks). Fetal anomalies and aneuploidy were excluded. Primary outcome was small for gestational age (SGA). Secondary outcomes included preeclampsia, neonatal cord arterial blood gas pH < 7.10 and < 7.05, base excess < - 8 and < - 12 mEq/L. Outcomes were compared between mothers with low MC airways and high MC airways using logistic regression. Results: A total of 1,823 women met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were found in the risk of SGA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-1.2), preeclampsia (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.9) or neonatal acidemia (aOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3-2.0), between high and low MC.

11867407,Morbid obesity and tracheal intubation,"The tracheas of obese patients may be more difficult to intubate than those of normal-weight patients. We studied 100 morbidly obese patients (body mass index >40 kg/m(2)) to identify which factors complicate direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Preoperative measurements (height, weight, neck circumference, width of mouth opening, sternomental distance, and thyromental distance) and Mallampati score were recorded. The view during direct laryngoscopy was graded, and the number of attempts at tracheal intubation was recorded. Neither absolute obesity nor body mass index was associated with intubation difficulties. Large neck circumference and high Mallampati score were the only predictors of potential intubation problems. Because in all but one patient the trachea was intubated successfully by direct laryngoscopy, the neck circumference that requires an intervention such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy to establish an airway remains unknown. We conclude that obesity alone is not predictive of tracheal intubation difficulties. Implications: In 100 morbidly obese patients, neither obesity nor body mass index predicted problems with tracheal intubation. However, a high Mallampati score (greater-than-or-equal to 3) and large neck circumference may increase the potential for difficult laryngoscopy and intubation.",1,1

Six were heart-lung (H-L) and 2 double-lung (D-L) recipients, 7 had left VCP, and 1 had right VCP. Based on the pulmonary function tests (PFT), 2 subgroups could be distinguished in the 8 recipients with VCP. Group A (5/8 recipients; mean age, 13 +/- 3.4 years; mean height, 144.3 +/- 12.3 cm) had significantly reduced specific airway conductance (sGaw; < 2 SD from predicted) and normal MEF25, MEF50, peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and %FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC); this pattern suggested variable extrathoracic airway obstruction. PIF was normal in 4/5 and reduced in 1/5 of these recipients. Group B (3/8 recipients with VCP; mean age, 17 +/- 2.4 years; mean height, 156.3 +/- 12.0 cm) had significantly reduced sGaw, MEF25, MEF50, PEF, FEV1, and %FEV1/FVC, implying primarily small airway obstruction. These recipients had bronchiolitis obliterans. The results suggest that a pattern of reduced sGaw and normal MEFs, PEF, FEV1, and PIF should raise the possibility of VCP in patients after lung transplantation. sGaw is more sensitive than PIF and PEF in identifying airway obstruction due to VCP, and should be routinely included in the follow-up evaluation of lung transplant recipients.",0,0

Patients and methods: Prospective, single-blinded randomized trial in 110 outpatients undergoing elective EGD and randomized 1:1 to BPS or standard sedation. Upon full recovery, the primary outcome of patient satisfaction was assessed using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (1 = not at all satisfied, 100 = completely satisfied). Sedation recovery times and recall of pain and gagging (1 = none, 100 = severe) were also evaluated using a VAS. Results: The BPS and standard sedation groups were similar regarding American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Mallampati class, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Compared with the standard sedation arm, the BPS group exhibited higher median procedural satisfaction (99 vs. 85, P < 0.001), and lower median scores for recall of pain (P < 0.001) and gagging (P < 0.001). BPS resulted in a shorter median recovery time (min) (11 vs. 23, P < 0.001). On multivariable regression analysis, predictors of patient satisfaction included use of propofol, increased age, and higher fentanyl dosage. Conclusions: BPS targeted to moderate sedation by adequately trained endoscopists results in superior patient satisfaction and shorter recovery times than standard sedation alone during EGD.",0,0
18280099,[Quality indicator survey of anaesthesia records in hospitals of Aquitaine],"Objectives: Assessing the quality of anaesthesia records according to the criteria of the reference frame of professional practices evaluation proposed by the French Anaesthetists College (Cfar) in 2005. Study design: Retrospective, multicentric study. Materials and methods: Fifty anaesthesia records were randomly selected from each of the 64 health care settings in Aquitaine with an inpatient surgery activity. Survey sampling was based on hospital stays longer than 24h occurring during the second half of 2005 and including a surgical procedure under anaesthesia, excepting local anaesthesia or regional analgesia for labour and delivery. Information regarding the 10 evaluation criteria defined by the Cfar and the French National Authority for Health were gathered. For each setting, the mean completion of the 50 records was rated by a global indicator defined by the number of criteria in conformity divided by the number of relevant criteria. Results: Three thousand one hundred and ninety-three anaesthetic files were screened. The completion of criteria varied between 1 and 92% with a wide dispersion for some criteria according to settings. Completions of airway assessment, preanaesthetic visit and perianaesthetic incidents/accidents were lower than 50%. The median conformity rate of the global indicator was 57%. Conclusion: This study brings information concerning the clinical relevance of anaesthesia records and preoperative evaluation practices.",0,0
26230452,Immobilization and volume reduction of heavy metals in municipal solid waste fly ash using nano-size calcium and iron-dispersed reagent,"This study was conducted to examine the synthesis and application of novel nano-size calcium/iron-based composite material as an immobilizing and separation treatment of the heavy metals in fly ash from municipal solid waste incineration. After grinding with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO and with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO₄], approximately 30 wt% and 25 wt% of magnetic fraction fly ash were separated. The highest amount of entrapped heavy metals was found in the lowest weight of the magnetically separated fly ash fraction (i.e., 91% in 25% of treated fly ash). Heavy metals in the magnetic or nonmagnetic fly ash fractions were about 98% and 100% immobilized, respectively. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS) observations indicate that the main fraction of enclosed/bound materials on treated fly ash includes Ca/PO₄-associated crystalline complexes. After nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO₄] treatment, the heavy metal concentrations in the fly ash leachate were much lower than the Japan standard regulatory limit for hazardous waste landfills. These results appear to be extremely promising. The addition of a nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/PO₄mixture with simple grinding technique is potentially applicable for the remediation and volume reduction of fly ash contaminated by heavy metals. Implications: After grinding with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO and nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO₄], approximately 30 wt% and 25 wt% of magnetic fraction fly ash were separated. The highest amount of entrapped heavy metals was found in the lowest weight of the magnetically separated fly ash fraction (i.e., 91% in 25% of treated fly ash), whereas heavy metals either in the magnetic or nonmagnetic fly ash fractions were about 98% and 100% immobilized. These results appear to be very promising, and the addition of nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/PO₄mixture with simple grinding technique may be considered potentially applicable for the remediation and volume reduction of contaminated fly ash by heavy metals.",0,0
24000653,[Video laryngoscopy and retromolar endoscopy in maxillofacial surgery],"The article presents successful intubation experience in 54 patients. Laryngoscopy was performed with McGrath Series 5 laryngoscopy with a difficult airway blade (""Airway Medical"") in 46 patients, and retromolar endoscope Bonfils (""Karl Storz"") in 9 patients. Technical traits, resulting from the use video laryngoscopy and retromolar endoscope are discussed. It was shown that video laryngoscopy is a high-performance intubation technique, including difficult ones. The possibility of video laryngoscope conduction in case of significant difficulties with mouth opening (max incisors distance of 1.3 cm) and atlantoccipital immobility make this method a real support to fiber bronchoscope intubation. Retromolar orotracheal intubation with Bonfils stylet training is associated with difficulties in case of insufficient endoscopy skills. During intubation the rule should be used: ""to enter prorsad, do everything vice versa"". The use of videolaryngoscopy and retromolar intubation is a real support for standard laryngoscopy and fiberbronchoscopy during orotracheal intubation including difficult ones. Difficult intubation may result from mouth opening restriction, atlantoocciital immobility and orolaryngopharynx deformation because of edema and rigidity, for example after an osteotomy or tumors presence. Videolaryngoscopy master is easier than retromolar endoscopy, because videolaryngoscope construction, laryngoscopy technique and larynx structures visualization are similar to the classic MAC blades.",0,0
12833493,Airway anomalies in children with Down syndrome: endoscopic findings,"Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal anomaly in humans. Numerous congenital malformations associated with DS have been described. However, there are insufficient data available about airway anomalies. Our objective was to characterize the clinical presentation, frequency, and type of airway anomalies in a population of patients with DS. A retrospective evaluation of flexible bronchoscopies performed in 24 DS patients due to significant respiratory morbidity was compared to the findings in 324 non-DS patients during the same time period. The procedure was carried out under sedation, using an Olympus BF3C20 bronchoscope. The main indications for the procedure were atelectasis of the right upper lobe (12/24) and stridor (7/24). The most common associated conditions were congenital heart disease (12/24) and reactive airways disease (12/24). The most important endoscopic findings were: laryngomalacia (12/24), tracheomalacia (8/24), tracheal bronchus (5/24), and bronchomalacia (5/24). Only six patients had a normal examination. Multiple airway anomalies (>/=2) were a common finding in this series. We conclude that patients with DS and respiratory symptoms have a high incidence of airway anomalies compared to non-DS patients. The clinician should have a high index of suspicion for airway anomalies in DS patients with respiratory symptoms.",0,0
15679130,Improving the success rate of laryngeal mask airway insertion during etomidate induction by using fentanyl or succinylcholine,"Background: Smooth and successful insertion of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) during etomidate induction requires a proper mouth opening and efforts to minimize airway reflexes such as gagging, coughing, or laryngospasm. We hypothesized that the concurrent use of fentanyl or succinylcholine with etomidate, the induction agent, could reduce the occurrence of airway reflexes and increase the success rate of LMA. Methods: Sixty adult patients, ASA class I-II, scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, were randomly allocated into three groups: group I in which patients were given etomidate 0.3 mg/kg alone; group 2 in which patients were given fentanyl 2 microg/kg and etomidate 0.3 mg/kg; groups 3 in which patients were give etomidate 0.3 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg. All patients were premedicated with atropine 0.01 mg/kg. When induction of anesthesia began we recorded the time from administering the designated regiminal agent or agents to the time of relaxation of jaw (the ease of mouth opening) and checked the patient for any excitatory movement after administering the induction agents. After inserting the LMA, we checked for signs of airway reflexes. Student's t test, Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the data. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: There were no significant differences in demographic data among the the three groups. The concurrent use of fentanyl or succinylcholine with etomidate during induction could significantly reduce the occurrence of excitatory movements and airway reflexes after LMA insertion, and increase the success rate of LMA insertion in comparison with using etomidate alone. Comparing the two adjutant agents, the concurrent use of succinylcholine could provide a significantly better jaw relaxation, shorten the time to insert the LMA and increase the success rate of LMA insertion. Conclusions: As an induction agent to facilitate insertion of LMA, etomidate alone was far from perfect. The concurrent use of 2 microg/kg of fentanyl with etomidate might significantly reduce the occurrence of airway reflexes in response to LMA insertion and increase the success rate of insertion. However, concurrent use of 1 mg/kg succinylcholine with etomidate might provide better results in terms of shortened time for the LMA insertion, jaw relaxation, and the success rate of LMA insertion than that of fentanyl.",0,0
18840591,"Emergency Cesarean delivery for umbilical cord prolapse: the head-down, knee-chest prone position for spinal anesthesia","Objective: Umbilical cord prolapse in a parturient is an emergency, where the need for immediate fetal delivery may conflict with maternal anesthetic risk factors. We describe the anesthetic management of a parturient who was rushed to the operating room, in the knee-chest prone position, because of cord prolapse with variable decelerations of fetal heart rate. Clinical features: A 28-yr-old multiparous patient presented at 37 weeks gestation. Her co-morbidities included morbid obesity and asthma. She had a Mallampati class IV airway. She required emergency Cesarean delivery, in view of umbilical cord prolapse, with evidence of fetal compromise. In light of the airway concerns, the urgency to proceed with delivery, and the presence of a palpable umbilical cord pulse in this position, we performed a spinal anesthetic in the knee-chest prone position, and immediately thereafter turned the patient supine, with lateral uterine displacement. Fetal heart rate was monitored throughout the procedure. The spinal anesthetic required less than five minutes to perform, from the time of skin preparation, until readiness for surgery. The subsequent surgical and anesthetic course was unremarkable. Conclusions: Performing spinal anesthesia in the knee-chest prone position served as an innovative solution for emergency Cesarean delivery in this case. Both the head-down lateral, and the head-down knee-chest prone positions, are compatible with spinal anesthesia, and the maternal position that achieves relief of cord compression, determined by the presence of a palpable umbilical cord pulse, may be the most important factor to determine the optimal approach to spinal anesthesia.",0,0
8874915,"Anaesthetic management of a parturient with severe muscular dystrophy, lumbar lordosis and a difficult airway","Purpose: This case describes the management of a 19-yr-old wheelchair bound primigravida with severe muscular dystrophy who presented for Caesarean section after spontaneous rupture of membranes. Anaesthesia was influenced by several features of her systemic disease which were impediments to both neuraxial and general anaesthesia. Clinical features: Other than for a prenatal record and the history obtainable from the patient, little additional medical information was available. Physical examination showed diffuse muscular weakness and an anatomically abnormal airway. Examination of the spine showed slight 10-15 degrees thoracolumbar scoliosis and > 45 degrees lumbar lordosis. Fetal assessment was normal. Echocardiography revealed mildly decreased left ventricular function and was consistent with pulmonary hypertension. After discussion with the patient and her obstetrician, elective Caesarean delivery was deemed the best management. Neuroaxial anaesthesia was at an increased risk of failure due to the profound lumbar lordosis. A plan for awake intubation and general anaesthesia was described to the patient in case regional anaesthesia could not be initiated. A fibreoptic bronchoscope and difficult intubation kit were made available. General anaesthesia was expected to have increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, hence epidural anaesthesia was attempted. After difficult catheter insertion, a sensory block was titrated to a T4 level. This was well tolerated by both mother and fetus. A healthy baby was delivered with Apgar scores of 9 and 9. Postoperatively the mother was transferred to the intensive care unit. After 72 hr, the patients respiratory status allowed transfer to the word. Conclusion: This case illustrates the use of epidural anaesthesia in the successful management of a severely compromised patient with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy undergoing elective Caesarean section.",0,0
9275382,[Comparative observation on the relationship between the MEFV and the visual inspection of small airway],"Objective: To compare the relationship between the MEFV and the visual inspection of small airway. Methods: According to the result on small airway function test (MEFV), the patients were divided into two group: MEFV abnormal group and MEFV normal group. Their bronchus and peripheral airway were observed with bronchofiberscope and ultra-thin bronchofiberscope. The visual appearance of the airways was scored in the light of the presence or absence of erythema, edema, secretions, etc. Results: The score of visual appearance observed or bronchitis index (BI) in small airway was 7.7 +/- 0.8 (BI: 3.0 +/- 0.8) and 4.7 +/- 1.6 (BI: 1.5 +/- 0.5) respectively in MEFV abnormal group and in MEFV normal group, namely the score in MEFV abnormal group was significantly higher than that of normal group (P < 0.01). The degree of pathological change in small airway was significantly correlated with the results of V25, V50, r = -0.6271, (P < 0.05) and r = 0.6964, (P < 0.02). Conclusion: The abnormal of MEFV may reflect inflamative pathological changes of small airway.",0,0
2021992,Perioperative management of paediatric microstomia,"Paediatric microstomia may occur congenitally in the whistling face syndrome but is more often acquired after accidental thermal injuries such as biting an electrical extension cord or ingesting household lye. The surgical correction of microstomia includes separation and cosmetic reconstruction of the fused lips and postoperative oral splinting. Microstomia from lye ingestion may be associated not only with limited mouth opening but also with such severe intraoral scarring that common landmarks guiding either rigid or flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy are obscured, rendering oral and nasotracheal intubation difficult or impossible. We report a case of paediatric microstomia after lye ingestion in which conventional direct laryngoscopy, flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy, and multiple blind nasal approaches to tracheal intubation were unsuccessful. However, tracheostomy was avoided and successful tracheal intubation was accomplished using a new rigid tubular pharyngolaryngoscope.",0,0
22781528,[Assessment and management of difficult airways in neonates with Pierre Robin sequence],"Objective: To assess the difficult airways preoperatively in neonates with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS).

Results: A total of 14 neonates (77%) had medium (n = 8) and severe (n = 6) airway obstruction. And 89% (n = 16) failed to display glottis and unsuccessful tracheal intubation (50%). Conclusion: The assessment practice of clinical observation, weight gain, airway obstruction and Cormack-Lehane classification may help to identify the difficult airways in neonates with PRS.",0,0
19704335,Narrow-band imaging bronchoscopy increases the specificity of bronchoscopic early lung cancer detection,"Background: Detection of nonsmall cell lung cancer at the intraepithelial stage is believed to improve cure rates. New bronchoscopic technologies, including white light videobronchoscopy (WLB), autofluorescence imaging (AFI), and narrow band imaging (NBI), are aiming to diagnose airway neoplasia at a preinvasive stage. Objectives: : To evaluate the diagnostic yields of NBI individually and in combination with WLB and AFI. Methods: A 10-month review of patients who were referred for airway screening or surveillance. Patients were randomized as to the order of AFI and NBI examinations. The airway mucosa was graded endoscopically as ""normal,"" ""abnormal,"" ""suspicious,"" or ""tumor."" All areas that were not normal were biopsied. Biopsies with a histologic grading of moderate to severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ were considered positive for intraepithelial neoplasia. Results: Sixty-two patients with a mean age of 56.2 +/- 9.8 years were studied. Five patients had invasive cancers and were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 57 cases had a 30% prevalence of intraepithelial neoplasia. The sensitivity of WLB was 0.18 and the specificity was 0.88. The relative sensitivities (compared with WLB) of AFI and NBI were 3.7 (p = 0.005) and 3.0 (p = 0.03), respectively. The relative specificities of AFI and NBI were 0.5 (p < 0.001) and 1.0 (p = 0.72), respectively. Combining AFI and NBI did not increase diagnostic yield significantly. The sequence of performing AFI and NBI did not impact findings. Conclusions: NBI is an alternative to AFI in the detection of early lung cancers because it has a comparatively higher specificity without significantly compromising the sensitivity.",0,0
21940397,"Randomized controlled trial of the A.P. Advance, McGrath, and Macintosh laryngoscopes in normal and difficult intubation scenarios: a manikin study","Background: Several videolaryngoscopes are available which may facilitate tracheal intubation in difficult airways. We compared the McGrath(®) Series 5 and the Venner™ A.P. Advance™ (APA) videolaryngoscopes with a Macintosh laryngoscope by studying the performance of experienced anaesthetists using manikins in normal and difficult airway scenarios. Methods: We recruited 48 anaesthetists into a randomized trial. Each performed tracheal intubation with each laryngoscope in one easy and one difficult laryngoscopy scenario. The primary endpoint was time to intubation. Other endpoints were time to best glottic visualization, grade of view, and number of glottic advances. Results: There were no dropouts. In the easy scenario, the time to intubation was greater using the McGrath [median time 40.7 s, inter-quartile range (IQR) 31.0, 57.4, P<0.001] than the other devices. In the difficult scenario, the time to intubation using the APA with Difficult Airway Blade (DAB) was less (median time 23.2 s, IQR 19.8, 29.0, P<0.001) than the other devices. Time to glottic visualization was reduced using the McGrath and the APA with DAB. Glottic advances were fewer using the APA with DAB. Conclusions: Experienced anaesthetists required a longer time for intubation in a standard manikin using a McGrath compared with other laryngoscopes, but a shorter time for intubation in a difficult manikin using an APA with DAB, and with fewer glottic advances, compared with other laryngoscopes.",0,0
25611621,Erroneous creation of a surgical airway through the thyrohyoid membrane,"This case report illustrates the importance of proper assessment, management, and creation of an emergent surgical airway. Assessment after the establishment of surgical airways should include confirmation of correct surgical site and appropriate location and depth of tracheostomy, tracheal tube, or catheter placement within the trachea. Supraglottic surgical airway access, as occurred in this case, can lead to laryngotracheal and esophageal injury. Early recognition and appropriate management of this complication can increase the likelihood of preservation of voice and airway function and minimize the extent of esophageal injury.",0,0
16717309,Video assessment of supraglottic airway orientation through the perilaryngeal airway in pediatric patients,"The COBRA perilaryngeal airway (PLA) is a new supraglottic airway device available for use in children. We studied the orientation of the larynx as viewed through the PLA using video obtained with a fiberoptic bronchoscope in 45 infants and children. Laryngeal view was scored, and position of the grill bars of the PLA and the epiglottis was assessed. An acceptable airway was obtained in all subjects, but the laryngeal view was nearly or completely obstructed in 76.9% of the patients 10 kg and less, with the epiglottis folded over the glottic opening. This was uncommon in larger children. The grill bars of the PLA were closely opposed to the epiglottis and supraglottic structures in nearly all subjects. We conclude that 1) the PLA provides an acceptable airway in infants and children, but infolding of the epiglottis with obstruction of the view of the glottic opening is common in infants, 2) extra vigilance for airway obstruction in this age group is necessary, and 3) the PLA's close opposition to the supraglottic structures suggests that removal in a deeper plane of anesthesia might minimize laryngeal stimulation.",0,0
2331084,[Anesthetic technics for the difficult intubation],"Numerous anaesthetic techniques exist for a patient who presents with a difficult endotracheal intubation. They all require an anaesthetic protocol which cannot be improvised. When intubation is expected to be difficult at the pre-anaesthetic examination, the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope is the technique of choice for intubating adults under local anaesthesia, and children under general anaesthesia. When a fiberoptic bronchoscope is not available, several alternatives can be suggested: local anaesthesia of the glottis, retro-molar and retrograde intubation, or the use of a guide threaded over a lighted stylet; these techniques can be used in an anaesthetized patient breathing spontaneously. In the paralyzed patient impossible to intubate, various trans-laryngeal techniques of ventilation can be used in emergency: jet ventilation via the trans-crico-thyroid route, the use of a cricotomy cannula, or a minitracheotomy set.",0,0
23878439,Predicting difficult laryngoscopy in acromegalic patients undergoing surgery for excision of pituitary tumors: A comparison of extended Mallampati score with modified Mallampati classification,"Background: There are numerous reports of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in patients with acromegaly. To date, no study has assessed the application of extended Mallampati score (EMS) for predicting difficult intubation in acromegalics. The primary aim of this study was to compare EMS with modified Mallampati classification (MMP) in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in acromegalic patients. We hypothesized that since EMS has been reported to be more specific and better predictor than MMP, it may be superior to the MMP to predict difficult laryngoscopy in acromegalic patients. Materials and methods: For this prospective cohort study with matched controls, acromegalic patients scheduled to undergo pituitary surgery over a period of 3 years (January 2008-December 2010) were enrolled. Preoperative airway assessment was performed by experienced anesthesiologists and involved a MMP and the EMS. Under anesthesia, laryngoscopic view was assessed using Cormack-Lehane (CL) grading. MMP and CL grades of I and II were defined ""easy"" and III and IV as ""difficult"". EMS grade of I and II were defined ""easy"" and III as ""difficult"". Data were used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of MMP and EMS in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Results: Seventy eight patients participated in the study (39 patients in each group). Both MMP and EMS failed to detect difficult laryngoscopy in seven patients. Only one laryngoscopy was predicted to be difficult by both tests which was in fact, difficult. Conclusion: We found that addition of neck extension did not improve the predictive value of MMP.",0,0
24979866,[Anesthetic management for caesarean delivery in a parturient with achondroplasia],"A 27-year-old parturient (height, 130 cm; weight, 43 kg) with achondroplasia, which is characterized by rhizomeric short stature, large head and frontal bossing, was scheduled for elective caesarean section (C/S) because of her contracted pelvis. Her first delivery had been performed by C/S under general anesthesia at a regional hospital 6 years before. Preoperative airway assessment showed normal mouth opening and mobile cervical spine. Since she had anxiety about needle puncture and refused neuraxial blockade and since we considered the trachea could be intubated, we decided to perform C/S under general anesthesia at 37 weeks of gestation. The patient and baby had an uneventful perioperative course. Underdevelopment of bone formation results in characteristic craniofacial and vertebral abnormalities in patients with achondroplasia. Anesthetic management of achondroplastic parturients should be specified to individual basis based on careful preoperative assessment of craniofacial and vertebral deformities.",0,0
24866377,"A survey of Canadian anesthesiologists' preferences in difficult intubation and ""cannot intubate, cannot ventilate"" situations","Introduction: The purpose of this survey was to determine the equipment that anesthesiologists prefer in difficult tracheal intubation and ""cannot intubate, cannot ventilate"" (CICV) situations. Methods: A questionnaire was e-mailed to members of the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society to ascertain their preferences, experience, and comfort level with regard to their use of airway equipment in difficult intubation and CICV situations in adult patients. A Chi square test was used to analyse the data. All reported P values are two-sided. Results: Nine hundred ninety-seven of 2,532 questionnaires (39%) were returned. In an unanticipated difficult direct laryngoscopic intubation situation, 893 of 997 (90%) respondents chose a video laryngoscope as the first-choice rescue technique, while 41 (4%) and 21 (2%) of respondents chose a flexible bronchoscope and an intubating laryngeal mask airway device, respectively. The majority of anesthesiologists had experience and were comfortable with using a flexible bronchoscope or a video laryngoscope. Regarding CICV, 294 of 955 (31%) respondents stated that they had never encountered it. Wire-guided cricothyroidotomy was chosen as the first-choice surgical airway by 375 of 955 (39%) respondents, while intravenous catheter cricothyroidotomy and ""defer to tracheostomy by surgeon"" were selected by 266 (28%) and 215 (23%) respondents, respectively. Seven hundred eighty-five of 997 (78%) respondents were familiar with the exact steps of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' difficult airway algorithm, while 448 (47%) had attended an airway workshop within the past five years. Conclusions: In a difficult intubation situation, the most frequently selected first-choice airway device was a video laryngoscope, followed by a flexible bronchoscope. In a CICV situation, the most frequently selected first-choice surgical airway technique was a wire-guided cricothyroidotomy, followed by an intravenous catheter cricothyroidotomy.",0,0
15886602,Anesthesia for MRI in the paediatric patient,"The magnetic resonance imaging suite is a challenging environment for the anaesthesiologists, and carries inherent risks. Several factors account for this, including the remote location, the unique features of the magnetic resonance imaging scanner and patient-related factors. A systematic approach, similar to that of anesthesia provided in the operating room (i.e. proper fasting, informed consent, focused airway examination, medical and surgical history, family history, previous sedation experiences) is mandatory. Understanding the implications of the magnetic resonance imaging environment will facilitate ensuring the safety of the patient. A well-equipped anesthesia machine, standard monitoring (electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation and non-invasive blood pressure), trained personnel and adequate planning should be standard for all out of the operating room procedures. Finally, rigorous discharge criteria are recommended to detect residual sedation.",0,0
26427628,Validation of human small airway measurements using endobronchial optical coherence tomography,"Background: Small airway remodeling is the cardinal feature underlying chronic airway diseases. There is no modality which identifies small airway pathological changes, which is crucial for early diagnosis, efficacy and prognostic assessment. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of endobronchial optical coherence tomography (EB-OCT) in assessing small airways morphology in vivo. Methods: Twelve patients with pulmonary nodules scheduled for lung resection underwent spirometry, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and EB-OCT. We measured D(mean) (mean luminal diameter), Ai (inner luminal area), Aw (airway wall area) and Aw% [Aw/(Ai + Aw) × 100%] from the 3rd to 5th generation bronchi of RB9 segment by MDCT. D(mean), Ai, Aw and Aw% from the 3rd to 9th generation bronchi of RB9 segment were measured by EB-OCT and histology. Correlations of these parameters, measured by three different methods, were evaluated. We recruited 4 COPD patients to determine if EB-OCT could identify peripheral airway remodeling. Results: The 4 parameters, measured by CT and EB-OCT, correlated significantly [D(mean) (r = 0.991), Ai (r = 0.997), Aw (r = 0.997), Aw% (r = 0.991), all P < 0.01]. Significant correlation were found for these parameters, measured by histology and EB-OCT, from the 3rd to 5th generation bronchi [D(mean) (r = 0.989), Ai (r = 0.997), Aw (r = 0.999), Aw% (r = 0.988), all P < 0.01], and from the 6th to 9th generation bronchi [D(mean) (r = 0.979), Ai (r = 0.997), Aw (r = 0.994) and Aw% (r = 0.988), all P < 0.01].

Furthermore it was quite difficult to place endotracheal tube, especially in younger children undergoing oral procedure. We examined the correlation among classification of mandibular hypoplasia (Pruzansky classification), the fusion of cervical spines and the degrees of difficulty in intubation for 16 patients who had had radiographs of skull, but we found no correlation among them. But in all the 3 patients with the fusion of cervical spines, intubation was difficult. Therefore, we must perform radiographic assessment of the fusion of the cervical spine.",0,0

The objective was to verify the effect of myofunctional therapy in a case of UARS in relation to morphological and functional aspects of the stomatognathic system, anthropometric data, and quality of sleep. Patient, aged 61 years, diagnosed with UARS, underwent 12 sessions of myofunctional therapy for 3 months with exercises aimed at the suprahyoid, the tongue, and the soft palate muscles. Evaluations were performed before the start of the therapeutic process, right after the end, as well as 1, 2, 4, and 10 months after the completion of the treatment, considering: tonicity and mobility of the suprahyoid muscles, the tongue, and the soft palate; modified Mallampati grade; neck circumference; body mass index; and parameters of sleep quality. After the therapeutic process, there was a decrease in scores related to the tonus of the suprahyoid muscles, mobility, and tonus of the tongue and of the soft palate. The Mallampati grade was IV in the initial evaluation, and III in subsequent assessment. There was a reduction of 2 cm in neck circumference and BMI remained similar over time. In analyzing the three parameters of sleep quality, improvement was observed in all evaluations after discharge. Therefore, the effect of myofunctional therapy in a case of UARS was positive for all parameters.",0,0
26154460,Craniofacial changes and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing in healthy children,"Introduction: The main cause of mouth breathing and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in childhood is associated with upper airway narrowing to varying degrees. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of morphological and functional craniofacial changes and the main clinical symptoms of SDB in healthy children. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted. A sample comprising 687 healthy schoolchildren, aged 7-12 years old and attending public schools, was assessed by medical history, clinical medical and dental examination, and respiratory tests. The self-perceived quality of life of mouth breathing children was obtained by a validated questionnaire. Results: Out of the total sample, 520 children were nose breathers (NB) while 167 (24.3%) were mouth breathers (MB); 32.5% had severe hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils, 18% had a Mallampati score of III or IV, 26.1% had excessive overjet and 17.7% had anterior open bite malocclusion. Among the MB, 53.9% had atresic palate, 35.9% had lip incompetence, 33.5% reported sleepiness during the day, 32.2% often sneezed, 32.2% had a stuffy nose, 19.6% snored, and 9.4% reported having the feeling to stop breathing while asleep. However, the self-perception of their quality of life was considered good. Conclusion: High prevalence of facial changes as well as signs and symptoms of mouth breathing were found among health children, requiring early diagnosis and treatment to reduce the risk of SDB.",0,0
19915475,The supraglottic airway I-gel in comparison with ProSeal laryngeal mask airway and classic laryngeal mask airway in anaesthetized patients,"Background and objective: The I-gel is a new single-use supraglottic airway device without an inflatable cuff. This study was designed to investigate the usefulness of the I-gel compared with the classic laryngeal mask airway (cLMA) and ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (pLMA) in anaesthetized, paralysed patients. Methods: The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients (n = 167) scheduled for orthopaedic surgery were included in this prospective study. General anaesthesia was achieved with intravenous infusion of propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium. The patients were randomly assigned to I-gel, pLMA and cLMA groups (64, 53 and 50 patients, respectively). Properly sized I-gel (No. 3-4) or LMA (No. 4-5) was inserted. We assessed haemodynamic data, airway leak pressure, leak volume, success rates and postoperative complications. Results: There were no differences in the demographic data and haemodynamic data immediately after insertion of devices among the three groups. The airway leak pressures of the I-gel group (27.1 +/- 6.4 cmH2O) and pLMA group (29.8 +/- 5.7 cmH2O) were significantly higher than that of the cLMA group (24.7 +/- 6.2 cmH2O). The success rates for first attempt of insertion were similar among the three groups (P = 0.670). There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events except for the larger incidence of sore throat in the cLMA group. Conclusion: I-gel may have a similar airway sealing to that of pLMA, higher than that of cLMA, and is not associated with adverse events. The I-gel might be an effective alternative as a supraglottic airway device.",0,0
23462579,Extrinsic bronchial obstruction caused by scoliosis,"Study design: A case report. Objective: To emphasize the importance of monitoring the breathing capacity in patients with moderate to severe scoliosis, even in adulthood. Summary of background data: Diseases that disturb the structure of the chest wall affect the function of the respiratory pump. Restrictive respiratory pattern is caused by severe scoliosis. However, scoliosis may provoke obstructive changes due to compression of the airways. It can be a direct compression because of imprinting of vertebral bodies, or an indirect one, due to rotation forces. METHODS.: We have collected data from the patients' clinical history and have reviewed similar published cases. Case presentation: a white female, with frequent respiratory tract infections during her childhood. She was diagnosed as having 55° right T5-T11 scoliosis. At age of 26, an increase of her pulmonary symptoms appeared with difficulty to expel mucus and medium efforts dyspnea. A computed axial tomographic scan showed T8 vertebral body pushing against the right intermediate bronchus. A bronchoscopy found a decrease in the bronchial area, with near contact between the walls. Lung function test: 41% forced vital capacity (FVC), 43% forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and 91 FEV1/FVC1. The patient underwent surgical correction using rods and pedicle screws; she had improvement of symptoms, image tests, and pulmonary function (70% FVC, 71% FEV1, and 101 FEV1/FVC). Conclusion: Increased frequency and severity of respiratory tract infections, difficulty in expelling mucus and dyspnea are warning signs of compromised airways. Spirometry tests and image tests such as computed axial tomography and bronchoscopy are essential for diagnosis. Surgical approach may be the treatment of choice.",0,0

19468563,[Bilateral blockade of the pudend nerve to hemorrhoidectomy in achondroplasic patient: case report],"Background and objectives: The achondroplasic dwarfism or achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism and occurs, in most of the cases, as a result of spontaneous genetic alteration. The anesthesia in these patients presents several particularities. The objective of the present report was to describe an achondroplasic patient case, with a previous history of surgical procedure of the vertebral column for medullar decompression, submitted to haemorrhoidectomy through the bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves. Case report: Male patient, 47 years old, achondroplasic, hospitalized to perform hemorrhoidectomy. Upon physical examination, he presented a shortened neck with limited extension of the head, Mallampati class IV, thyromental distance of 6 cm and opening of the mouth of 3.5 cm. The vertebral column presented thoracic kyphosis and severe lumbar lordosis, in addition to a surgical scar in the lumbar region. A bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves was performed with ropivacaine at 1%, via transperineal, with isolated needle measuring 0.8 mm x 100 mm 21G (Stimuplex A100 BBraun, Melsungen, Germany) connected to the peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex-DIG, BBraun).The patient was positioned in ventral decubitus and the surgery started after 15 minutes of anesthetic administration. During the entire procedure, the patient remained conscious and did not report pain or discomfort. Up to the moment his hospital discharge (22 hours after the performance of the blockade), the patient did not mention pain, discomfort, nausea, vomit, motor blockade, urinary retention or incontinence. After his discharge from the hospital, he evolved well presenting evacuation after 31 hours from surgery. Conclusions: The case illustrated the use of the bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves, with the help of the neurostimulator, as an isolated anesthetic techniques for hemorrhoidectomy.",0,0
2644052,Laryngoscope design and the difficult adult tracheal intubation,"Clinical examination of a patient is very likely to reveal the factors making tracheal intubation difficult and thus increasing the likelihood of a traumatized temporo-mandibular joint or mouth. Although laryngoscopes and bronchoscopes incorporating fiberoptic visual devices are invaluable they are usually only employed for extremely difficult patients. Other laryngoscopes exist in a variety of designs and can be categorised according to the particular problem they address: (i) prominent sternal region, (ii) narrow space between the incisors, (iii) reduced intraoral space and, (iv) the anteriorly positioned larynx. An atraumatic tracheal intubation will be assisted if the laryngoscope blade to be used is selected on the basis of the anatomic difficulties prescribed by the patient. The Miller, Jackson-Wisconsin, Macintosh, Soper, Bizarri-Guffrida, and Bainton blades together with appropriate handles and fittings comprise a group from which selection can be made.",0,0
25199334,[General anesthesia for a pregnant patient with PAPA syndrome],"A 31-year-old female, with 22 weeks of pregnancy, presented with sudden onset of severe headache. CT scan showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. A cerebral angiogram showed dissecting aneurysm of right cerebral artery. To obliterate the aneurysm and prevent rupture, the patient underwent coil embolization via an endovascular approach under general anesthesia because the procedure under sedation with local anesthesia was too risky for re-bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed as PAPA syndrome. Although the arthritis was now stable and she was taking no drug, remarkable osteoarthritis was observed. The cervical spine X ray demonstrated no cervical ankylosis. As patient was sedated with propofol, airway examination could not be done except noticing thyromental distance of seven centimeters. Patient's trachea was intubated using Macintosh size #3 laryngoscope blade and a 7.0 non-styletted tracheal tube at the first attempt without any problems (Cormack grade I). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, fentanyl and remifentanil. After the end of endovascular surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation. She was weaned from mechanical ventilation 2 days later but consciousness was unclear. Right incomplete paralysis was also observed. MRI revealed vasospasm on the bilateral internal carotid artery. The patient underwent percutaneous tansluminalangioplasty coil and intraarterial injection of fasudil hydrochloride under local anesthesia. The consciousness recovered fully and the paralysis was improved. The patient delivered the baby by Caesarean sections under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia at 36 weeks without any problems with both the mother and baby.",0,0

A female aged 76 years with American Society of Anesthetists risk Class IV E with an apparently normal preoperative temporomandibular joint was scheduled for emergency laparotomy. Following rapid sequence induction, and muscle relaxation with rocuronium, the anesthesiologist noticed lock-jaw when intubation was attempted. She was ventilated with nasopharyngeal airway, but was progressively desaturating. An emergency tracheostomy was performed. Unfortunately, she sustained cardiac arrest and could not be revived. The complication of the lock-jaw is a nightmare to airway management, especially in an unprepared situation.",0,0
18507649,Sputum neurokinin A in Egyptian asthmatic children and adolescents: relation to exacerbation severity,"Background: Neurogenic inflammation may participate in the development and progression of bronchial asthma. The molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenic inflammation are orchestrated by a large number of neuropeptides including tachykinins such as neurokinin A (NKA) and substance P. Tachykinins are secreted from sensory airway nerves and inflammatory cells after allergens exposure. In clinical practice, assessment of airway inflammation is difficult. Therefore, detection of biological markers of airway inflammation in sputum might offer help for proper monitoring of asthma severity. Aim of the study: We aimed to measure sputum NKA in relation to acute asthma exacerbations of varying severity. Methods: Sputum NKA was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 24 children and adolescents during and after acute asthma exacerbation and 24 healthy matched controls. Results: Sputum NKA was significantly higher in asthmatic patients during acute exacerbation than controls [217.5 (284) vs 10 (7) ng/ml, P < 0.001]. When patients with acute asthma exacerbation were followed-up till remission, sputum NKA levels decreased significantly, but they remained significantly higher than controls. Sputum NKA levels were significantly higher in severe than moderate and in moderate than mild exacerbations, and was negatively correlated to peak expiratory flow rate (r = -0.9, P < 0.001). Sputum NKA had significant positive correlations to eosinophil counts in blood and sputum (r = 0.6, P < 0.001 and r = 0.7, P < 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: Sputum NKA is up-regulated during acute asthma exacerbation and it positively correlates to its severity. Thus, NKA may aid in objective classification of the exacerbation severity. In addition, NKA may be a target for new asthma therapy.",0,0
24810379,[French national survey on difficult intubation in intensive care units],"Objectives: Assessing the theoretical knowledge, practical experience of French intensivists, and their compliance with French Anesthesiology and Critical Care Society's difficult airway algorithms of the expert's SFAR conference of 2006. Study design: Prospective and descriptive national survey. Material and methods: An anonymous questionnaire with 40 questions was emailed to physicians working in intensive care units in France. Results: Five hundred and eight intensivists answered the survey. Ninety-seven percent of physicians reported having a portable storage unit for difficult intubation. As for practical experience, 421 physicians (83 %) have set up less than 10 laryngeal mask airway, 257 (51 %) have performed less than 10 intubations under fibroscopy and 269 (53 %) have never performed a cricothyroidotomy on mannequin, and 331 (65 %) on a patient. In case of emergency intubation, 29 % of them do not use a rapid sequence induction. Three hundred physicians (59 %) use capnography as monitoring of the endotracheal position. Two hundred and nine (42 %) consider they have not been trained to difficult intubation and 443 (87 %) would like to participate in high fidelity simulations mannequin. Conclusions: National airway management algorithm was insufficiently followed. Alternative techniques do not seem to be mastered by all physicians. French intensivists expect more training on difficult intubation, including high fidelity simulation.",0,0
19857270,Successful establishment of primary small airway cell cultures in human lung transplantation,"Background: The study of small airway diseases such as post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is hampered by the difficulty in assessing peripheral airway function either physiologically or directly. Our aims were to develop robust methods for sampling small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and to establish submerged SAEC cultures for downstream experimentation. Methods: SAEC were obtained at 62 post-transplant bronchoscopies in 26 patients using radiologically guided bronchial brushings. Submerged cell cultures were established and SAEC lineage was confirmed using expression of clara cell secretory protein (CCSP). Results: The cell yield for SAEC (0.956 +/- 0.063 x 106) was lower than for large airway cells (1.306 +/- 0.077 x 106) but did not significantly impact on the culture establishment rate (79.0 +/- 5.2% vs. 83.8 +/- 4.7% p = 0.49). The presence of BOS significantly compromised culture success (independent of cell yield) for SAEC (odds ratio (95%CI) 0.067 (0.01-0.40)) but not LAEC (0.3 (0.05-1.9)). Established cultures were successfully passaged and expanded. Conclusion: Primary SAEC can be successfully obtained from human lung transplant recipients and maintained in culture for downstream experimentation. This technique will facilitate the development of primary in vitro models for BOS and other diseases with a small airway component such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD.",0,0
17898397,A two-dimensional model of anatomic relationships during laryngoscopy,"Background: The view obtained during direct laryngoscopy is only seen by a single anesthesiologist. The inability of instructors to observe the view poses problems for teaching the technique. The anatomic interactions affecting laryngoscopy are largely internal, hampering efforts to understand why some patients are unexpectedly difficult to intubate. In response, we have constructed a full scale, adjustable, two-dimensional model showing the head and neck in the sagittal plane. In this article, we validate the mannequin and test how various conditions or changes in equipment affect the laryngoscopic view. Methods: Model parameters were compared with literature values. Glottic exposure was evaluated over a range of jaw lengths and interincisor gaps for Macintosh 3, Miller 2, and Macintosh 4 blades. Results: Thirty segmental airway distances and 10 angles were within 1 standard deviation from published values. Spine and jaw mobilities approximated normal range of motion. Glottic exposure decreased steeply for mouth openings below a threshold. A larger mouth opening was required to obtain a view when the mandible was short. None of the blades exposed the glottis when mouth opening was narrow, 2.4 cm. The Macintosh 4 blade was closest to success, within 7 mm of viewing the posterior cords. Conclusions: The model reflects an average 16-yr-old male patient in size, proportion, and mobility. It can be used to explicate how anatomic relationships affect laryngoscopy. An objective assessment is necessary to determine the model's utility for teaching and as a tool for researching the mechanisms responsible for laryngoscopic difficulty.",0,0
26794330,[The relationship between passive rhinomanometry measurements in sitting and supine position and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome],"Objectives: This study aims to investigate the possible relationship between passive rhinomanometry measurements in sitting and supine position and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Patients and methods: Between January 2011 and December 2013, 88 male patients (mean age 46.8 years; range 18 to 79 years) underwent passive rhinomanometry in sitting and supine position following history, physical examination and fiberoptic endoscopic examination. 1.5 lt/sn air flow was pumped into the nose of each patient via a silicone nasal mask. Meanwhile, flow and pressure values were measured. Results: There was no correlation between the resistance values and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) scores and polysomnography and physical examination parameters (p>0.05). The differential resistance was correlated with AHI (r=0.325, p<0.05), body mass index (r=0.324, p<0.05), neck circumference (r=0.421, p<0.01), waist circumference (r=0.444, p<0.01), modified Mallampati score (r=0.356, p<0.05), and retropalatal grade (r=0.438, p<0.01). Conclusion: The correlation between the differential resistance and physical examination parameters and AHI scores support the hypothesis that position-related retropalatal segment alterations can be measured by passive rhinomanometry while awake.",0,0
25430446,Application of a new combined model including radiological indicators to predict difficult airway in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis,"Background: Airway management is crucial in clinical anesthesia. Many complications associated with airway management result from unexpected difficult airway, but predicting a difficult airway is a major challenge. We investigated the efficacy of a new combined model including radiological indicators to predict difficult airway in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis, a population with a high incidence of difficult airway. Methods: We randomly enrolled 303 patients scheduled for elective surgery for cervical spondylosis at Peking University Third Hospital between August 2012 and March 2013. Preoperatively, patients were evaluated for difficult airway according to a clinical index and parameters on lateral cervical radiographs and magnetic resonance images. Difficult airway was defined as Cormack-Lehane grades III-IV. Logistic regression was used to identify a combined (clinical and radiological) model for difficult airway. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to describe the effectiveness of prediction. Results: We identified three clinical predictive factors using the ROC curve: mouth opening, sternomental distance, and neck mobility. We created a clinical model using three factors: gender, age, and mouth opening, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.370, 1.034, and 0.358, respectively. Using the clinical and radiological parameters, we formulated a combined model with five risk factors: gender, mouth opening, atlanto-occipital gap, the angle from the second to sixth cervical vertebraes in the neutral position, and the angle difference of d (the angle between the laryngeal axis and the epiglottic axis) from the neutral position to extension (OR: 0.107, 0.355, 0.846, 1.057, and 0.952, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of the combined model were 80.0% and 65.7%, respectively, and the ROC curve confirmed that the combined model was better than any single clinical predictor and the clinical model. Conclusion: The efficacy of the combined model including both clinical and radiological indicators was better than any single clinical predictor or the clinical model in patients undergoing elective surgery for cervical spondylosis.",0,0

Fifty-four anaesthesiologists answered (response rate: 57%). Fifty-seven percent would perform an epidural anaesthesia (EA) through the tattoo. Thirty-nine percent would not; among which two third only would propose an alternative for EA. Elective or emergency caesarean section would prompt most of the anaesthesiologists to perform a spinal anaesthesia, especially in parturients with Mallampati Class III (93%) versus Class I (70%) airway. Seventy percent of responders reported no consensual management in their unit.

15578472,Difficult intubation in pediatric cardiac anesthesia,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate cases of difficult intubation in pediatric cardiac surgical patients and to evaluate the importance of associated congenital abnormalities. Design: Retrospective analysis. Setting: Departments of Anesthesiology and Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery of a tertiary university hospital. Participants: All children undergoing congenital heart surgery. Interventions: Patients who had difficult intubations according to their anesthetic charts were further evaluated from hospital files for demographic characteristics, associated congenital abnormalities, and perioperative airway and/or respiratory complications. Measurements and main results: A total of 1,278 pediatric patients with congenital heart disease were operated on from January 1999 to July 2002. Difficult intubation was encountered in 16 cases (1.25%). Two of these were newborns, 11 were infants, and 3 were in the pediatric age group. Anterior larynx was the most common reason for difficult intubation (7 cases, 43.7%). There were associated syndromes and/or other congenital abnormalities in 8 children (50%). Conclusion: The likelihood of difficult intubation during pediatric cardiac surgery, especially in cases with other congenital pathologies should be kept in mind, and the anesthetic approach must be planned accordingly.",0,0
15753502,"Modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance and inter-incisor gap are the best predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in West Africans","Purpose: To determine the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx (DVL) from the following preoperative airway predictive indices, in isolation and combination: modified Mallampati test (MMT), thyromental distance (TMD), sternomental distance (SMD), horizontal length of the mandible (HLM) and inter-incisor gap (IIG). Methods: Three hundred and eighty consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia were evaluated using the MMT, TMD, SMD, HLM and IIG and the cut-off points for the airway predictors were Mallampati III and IV; < or = 6.5 cm, < or = 13.5 cm, < or = 9.0 cm and < or = 4.0 cm respectively. During direct laryngoscopy, the laryngeal view was graded using the Cormack and Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult visualization. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of DVL. Results: Difficulty to visualize the larynx was found in 13 (3.4%) patients. The sensitivity, specificity and the positive predictive value for the five airway predictors were: MMT (61.5%; 98.4%; 57.1%), TMD (15.4%; 98.1%; 22.2%), SMD (0%; 100%; 0%), HLM (30.8%, 76.0%; 4.3%) and IIG (30.8%; 97.3%; 28.6%). The best combination of predictors was MMT/TMD/IIG with a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 84.6%; 94.6%; 35.5% respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that weight, MMT, IIG and TMD were independent predictors of DVL. Conclusion: MMT, TMD and IIG appear to provide the optimal combination in prediction of DVL in a West African population.",1,1
10941589,Teaching airway management skills. How and what to learn and teach,"It is important to instruct all individuals involved in patient care in airway management. The degree of skills actually taught depends on the student. Currently, there are many options for teaching. Mannequin training is the one best suited to instruct a large number of students in a variety of skills. Training of surgical and obstetric residents improves relations, may improve patient safety, and educates these individuals regarding the risks of failed intubation. Actual clinical decisions regarding patient management are based on the airway examination. There is room for improvement in instruction, even in anesthesiology programs. Various techniques must be taught and practiced. As more anesthesiologists become trained and then train other physicians, the number of cases in the Closed Claims Study involving the airway will continue to decrease.",0,0

15781548,The chewing of betel quid and oral submucous fibrosis and anesthesia,"Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a premalignant lesion of the buccal mucosa caused by chewing betel quid. It results in progressive inability to open the mouth. OSMF causes difficulty in laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea. Patients with OSMF require anesthesia for trismus correction, resection, and reconstructive (oncoplastic) surgery for coexisting oral malignancies or other unrelated surgeries. Our review of the anesthetics of 44 patients with oral malignancies suggested that 8 had OSMF. The preoperative airway assessment, including the Mallampati score and the clinical Tumor Node Metastasis stage, were useful in predicting the need for fiberoptic intubation. Patients with oral malignancies and OSMF had increased requirement for fiberoptic endotracheal intubations (62.5%) compared with those without OSMF (44.4%). Three different techniques of airway management (tracheal intubation after direct laryngoscopy, fiberoptic tracheal intubation, and tracheostomy) in four patients with OSMF are described. OSMF contributes to the development of the malignancy, delays the diagnoses, and complicates the anesthetic management.",0,0

8595696,Evaluation of the Augustine Guide for difficult tracheal intubation,"Successful tracheal intubation with Augustine Guide (Augustine Medical, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN) in patients with normal airways has recently been described. There are no studies describing Augustine Guide (AG) use in patients with difficult airways. Accordingly, we studied AG intubation in a population of patients with expected difficult airways due to cervical spine pathology, limited mouth opening, obesity, facial trauma or deformity due to previous operation or radiation and in patients with unexpectedly difficult airways. A total of 44 patients were studied. The AG was used as a primary intubating tool in patients with known difficult airways (n = 36) and as a secondary intubating tool in patients with unexpected inability to intubate using conventional direct laryngoscopy (n = 8). Airway difficulty was predicted by history and physical examination. Intubations were performed under general anaesthesia in 40 of the 44 patients studied. In four patients with predictably difficult airways, topical anaesthesia and sedation were used. Backup methods to achieve intubation were available. Thirty-two of the 36 with known or suspected difficult airways were classified as Mallampati Class III or IV. In the remaining eight patients the preoperative examination suggested an easy airway; however, after induction of general anaesthesia, their laryngeal inlet could not be seen using direct laryngoscopy. Using the AG, all were intubated successfully (36/44 at the first attempt, in 8/44 repositioning of the AG to allow successful laryngeal entry of the stylet was necessary). There were no failures or complications secondary to AG use. This study shows that the AG is a useful device for oral tracheal intubation in patients with known or unexpectedly difficult airways.",0,0
9618131,Investigative techniques in the assessment of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia,"Oral-pharyngeal dysphagia is a common problem with a high morbidity and mortality. In general, it is not managed as well as esophageal dysphagia by gastroenterologists. A number of techniques are now available for the assessment of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia. However, a careful clinical assessment followed by a video barium swallow is all that is required for the diagnosis and management in the majority of patients. Pharyngeal manometry is likely to play an increasingly important role in the assessment of difficult or atypical cases in whom it can provide functional information not achievable with videoradiography alone. Videolaryngoscopy is a quick and simple way of detecting structural lesions and of assessing deglutitive airway protection. Videolaryngoscopy is non-invasive and easily performed in an office setting. Ultrasonography is a convenient way of assessing lingual function, but provides no more information than the video barium swallow. Pharyngeal scintigraphy is likely to assume a greater clinical relevance as a means of quantifying swallow efficiency and response to therapy.",0,0

24353862,Nasal obstruction and palate-tongue position on sleep-disordered breathing,"Objectives: We wanted to evaluate whether the presence of nasal obstruction makes a change on the association between the modified Mallampati score and the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and the sleep quality. Methods: Polysomnography (PSG), the modified Mallampati score (MMS), the body-mass index, and a questionnaire about nasal obstruction were acquired from 275 suspected SDB patients. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the presence of nasal obstruction. The clinical differences between the two groups were evaluated and the associations between the MMS and PSG variables in each group were also assessed. Results: Significant correlations were found between the MMS and many PSG variables, including the apnea-hypopnea index, the arousal index and the proportion of deep sleep, for the patients with nasal obstruction, although this was not valid for the total patients or the patients without nasal obstruction. Conclusion: The severity of SDB and the quality of sleep are well correlated with the MMS, and especially for the patients with nasal obstruction. The MMS can give more valuable information about the severity of SDB when combined with simple questions about nasal obstruction.",0,0
18646710,[The target plasma concentration of propofol required to induce electroencephalography burst suppression with target-controlled infusion],"Objective: To determine the optimal target plasma concentration of propofol required to induce EEG burst suppression administered by TCI in order to decrease cerebral metabolic rate and increase tolerance to cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. Methods: One hundred and fifty ASA I-II patients(aged 18-55 years-old, BMI < 30, Mallampati Score I-II) scheduled for elective surgery undergoing general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. Patients with systemic diseases or other factors effecting the electrical activity of brain were excluded. ECG, IBP, SpO2, PetCO2, Temperature and EEG (two-channel referential montage system) were continuously monitored during the procedure. Patients were induced with TCI propofol (the target plasma concentration was initially set at 5.4 microg/ml), After induction and intubation, target plasma concentration was increased by 0.3 microg/ml increment and sustained 15 minutes until EEG burst suppression appeared(stable burst suppression waveform and BSR > 50%), and this target concentration was recorded. Results: The mean target plasma concentration of propofol with TCI required to induce EEG burst suppression was 6.1 +/- 0.6 microg/ml with 95% confidence interval of 5.99-6.19 microg/ml. There was no significant difference between the genders. Conclusions: The target plasma concentration of propofol reached 6.2 microg/ml can induce EEG burst suppression, which is better for intraoperative cerebral protection.",0,0
8104675,Rhythmic delta-frequency activities in the nucleus accumbens of anesthetized and freely moving rats,"In urethane-anesthetized rats, a membrane potential oscillation (MPO) of up to 30 mV and 0.5-2 Hz (delta frequency range) was found in neurons of the nucleus accumbens. The membrane potential oscillations were of similar frequency and reversed in phase to the extracellular EEG of about 0.5 mV. In freely moving rats, a rhythmic delta EEG of 0.5-3 Hz was found in the nucleus accumbens, and it was of highest amplitude and regularity during awake immobility and face washing, less regular during slow wave sleep, and of the lowest amplitude during body and head movements and rapid eye movement sleep. The behavioural relation of the accumbens EEG was not critically affected after amphetamine, haloperidol, and parachlorophenylalanine, which depleted serotonin, although the accumbens EEG during awake immobility was less regular after blocking muscarinic cholinergic receptors by atropine sulfate. However, stimulation of the ventral tegmental area suppressed the accumbens delta membrane potential oscillations and EEG, and this effect was antagonized by haloperidol, suggesting that endogenous dopamine release may suppress the accumbens delta rhythm. It was concluded that the delta rhythm in the nucleus accumbens may represent a state of bilateral synchrony among accumbens neurons that is perhaps characteristic of an idling system, while desynchronization of the delta rhythm may occur closely with motor action.",0,0
23918003,Postoperative laryngeal symptoms in a general surgery setting. Clinical study,"Introduction: Vocal cord injuries (VI), postoperative hoarseness (PH), dysphonia (DN), dysphagia (DG) and sore throat (ST) are common complications after general anesthesia; there is actually a lack of consensus to support the proper timing for post-operative laryngoscopy that is reliable to support the diagnosis of laryngeal or vocal fold lesions after surgery and there are no valid studies about the entity of laryngeal trauma in oro-tracheal intubation. Aim of our study is to evaluate the statistical relation between anatomic, anesthesiological and surgical variables in the case of PH, DG or impaired voice register. Materials and methods: 50 patients (30 thyroidectomies, 8 videolaparoscopic cholecistectomies, 2 right emicolectomies, 2 left emicolectomies, 1 gastrectomy, 1 hemorrhoidectomy, 1 nefrectomy, 1 diagnostic videothoracoscopy, 1 superior right lung lobectomy, 1 appendicectomy, 1 incisional hernia repair, 1 low anterior rectal resection, 1 radical hysterectomy) underwent clinical evaluation and direct laryngoscopy before surgery, within 6 hours, after 72 hours and after 30 days, to evaluate motility and breathing space, phonatory motility, true and false vocal folds and arytenoids oedema. We evaluated also mean age (56.6 ± 3.6 years), male:female ratio (1:1.5), cigarette smoke (20%), atopic comorbidity (17/50 = 34%), Mallampati class (32% 1, 38% 2, 26% 3, 2% 4), mean duration of intubation (159 minutes, range 50 - 405 minutes), Cormack-Lehane score (34% 1, 22% 2, 22% 3, 2% 4), difficult intubation in 9 cases (18%). No complication during the laryngoscopy were registered. We investigated the statistic relationship between pre and intraoperative variables and laryngeal symptoms and lesions. Results: In our experience, statistically significant relations were found in prevalence of vocal folds oedema in smokers (p < 0.005), self limiting DG and DN in younger patients (p < 0.005) and in thyroidectomy (p < 0.01), DG after thyroidectomy (p < 0.01). The short preoperative use of steroids and antihistaminic to prevent allergic reactions appears not related to reduction or prevention of DN, DG, PH and ST. No statistical relation in incidence of postoperative complications was found for the prolonged intubation, gastro-esophageal reflux, BURP manoeuvre (backward upward right sided pressure) and Mallampati and Cormack-Lehane class more than 2, maintenance with sevoflurane 2% and use of stilet. Conclusions: Direct laryngoscopy is essential for the detection of arytenoid lesions after orotracheal intubation for general anesthesia. In our opinion, a part of temporary post-operative DN or PH is due to monolateral or bilateral arytenoids oedema, secondary to prolonged or difficult orotracheal intubation, valuable with laryngoscopy 72 hours after surgery. Is necessary to adjunct these complications in the surgical informed consensus scheme.",0,0
25925037,Does ultrasonographic volume of the thyroid gland correlate with difficult intubation? An observational study,"Background and objectives: Preoperative ultrasonographic evaluation of the thyroid gland done by surgeons could let us foresee airway management challenges. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effects of thyroid-related parameters assessed preoperatively by surgeons via ultrasonography and chest X-ray on intubation conditions. Methods: Fifty patients undergoing thyroid surgery were enrolled. Thyromental distance, Mallampati score, neck circumference and range of neck movement were evaluated before the operation. Thyroid volume, signs of invasion or compression and tracheal deviation on chest X-ray were also noted. The intubation conditions were assessed with Cormack and Lehane score and the intubation difficulty scale. Statistical analyses were done with SPSS 15.0 software. Results: The mean thyroid volume of the patients was 26.38 ± 14 mL. The median intubation difficulty scale was 1 (0-2). Thyromental distance (p = 0.011; r = 0.36; 95% CI 0.582-0.088), Mallampati score (p = 0.041; r = 0.29; 95% CI 0.013-0.526), compression or invasion signs (p = 0.041; r = 0.28; 95% CI 0.006-0.521) and tracheal deviation on chest X-ray (p = 0.041; r = 0.52; 95% CI 0.268-0.702) were correlated with intubation difficulty scale. Also patients were classified into two groups related to their intubation difficulty scale (Group I, n = 19: intubation difficulty scale = 0; Group II, n = 31: 1< intubation difficulty scale ≤ 5) and difficult intubation predictors and thyroid-related parameters were compared. Only Mallampati score was significantly different between groups (p = 0.025). Conclusion: The thyroid volume is not associated with difficult intubation. However clinical assessment parameters may predict difficult intubation.",0,0
23588011,Emergency airway management: common ventilation techniques,"Maintaining a patient's airway and facilitating breathing are the main priorities during any emergency situation in which breathing is compromised. The key to safe management of an airway is thorough assessment, primarily to ensure the airway is patent. In an emergency situation, a bag-valve-mask may be the most effective way to assist ventilation. If ventilation is required for prolonged periods in an emergency situation, then endotracheal intubation should be performed. This involves the placement of a cuffed, endotracheal tube in the trachea, through which ventilation is maintained. Each tracheal intubation event should be anticipated as a potentially difficult intubation. Longer term ventilatory support may be achieved by the use of mechanical ventilators, which are designed to assist the movement of gases (air) into and out of a patient's lungs, while minimising the work and effort of breathing. This article provides nurses with an overview of the techniques and equipment that is most often used within emergency and intensive care units to maintain the patency of a patient's airway and provide ventilatory support.",0,0
7436242,Acute upper airway obstruction in infants and children. Evaluation by the fiberoptic bronchoscope,"All infants and children seen by the pediatric pulmonary service who display symptoms of upper airway obstruction undergo transnasal fiberoptic evaluation with the 3.2 mm flexible instrument. The procedure enables the observer to immediately visualize the nasopharynx, supraglottic, glottic and subglottic structures. Instrumentation is done in the sitting upright position and takes the skilled observer about 20 seconds to perform. The differentiation of epiglottitis from subglottic croup, foreign body aspiration and other less common causes of airway obstruction is easily performed and well tolerated. The fiberoptic instrument is often utilized both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. It can be utilized to intubate cases of epiglottitis and to evaluate the epiglottis to determine the appropriate time for extubation. This procedure is superior to oral airway examination because it does not distort airway anatomy, can be performed in the upright position, and does not further exacerbate airway obstruction.",0,0
19185869,Development and validation of a liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of capreomycin sulfate and its related substances,"A gradient LC method for the analysis of capreomycin sulfate and its related substances was developed. The chromatographic conditions include the use of a Hypersil base deactivated C(18) (250 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm) column maintained at 25 degrees C, a mobile phase containing acetonitrile, phosphate buffer pH 2.3 and 0.025M hexanesulfonate at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and UV detection performed at 268 nm. Good separation of the four active components of capreomycin and eleven unknown impurities was achieved. A system suitability test to check the quality of the separation is specified. The method shows good repeatability, linearity and robustness.",0,0
12131113,The unexpected difficult airway and lingual tonsil hyperplasia: a case series and a review of the literature,"Background: An unexpected difficult intubation occurs because physical examination of the airway is imperfect in predicting it. Lingual tonsil hyperplasia (LTH) is one risk factor for an unanticipated failed intubation that is not detectable during a routine oropharyngeal examination. The authors attempted to determine the incidence of LTH in unanticipated failed intubation in patients subjected to general anesthesia. Methods: Thirty-three patients with unanticipated failed intubation via direct laryngoscopy were subjected to airway examinations and fiberoptic pharyngoscopy to determine the cause(s) of failure. Mouth opening, mandibular subluxation, head extension, thyromental distance, and Mallampati airway class were recorded. Fiberoptic pharyngoscopy was then performed to evaluate the base of the tongue and valleculae. Results: Of these 33 patients, none had an airway examination that suggested a difficult intubation. The lungs of 12 patients were difficult to ventilate by mask. In 15 patients, airway measurements were within normal limits with Mallampati class of I or II. Ten patients had a Mallampati class III airway, 6 associated with obesity and 5 with mildly limited head extension. Among the 5 morbidly obese patients, most of the weight was distributed on the lower trunk and body. The 3 remaining patients had a thyromental distance of 6 cm or less but otherwise had a normal airway examination. The only finding common to all 33 patients was LTH observed on fiberoptic pharyngoscopy. Conclusion: Lingual tonsil hyperplasia can interfere with rigid laryngoscopic intubation and face mask ventilation. Routine physical examination of the airway will not identify its presence. The prevalence of LTH in adults and the extent of its contribution to failed intubation is unknown.",0,0
19399488,Comparing three-dimensional volume-rendered CT images with fibreoptic tracheobronchoscopy in the evaluation of airway compression caused by tuberculous lymphadenopathy in children,"Background: Lymphobronchial tuberculosis (TB) causes airway compression in 38% of patients. The airway obstruction is conventionally assessed with fibreoptic tracheobronchoscopy (FTB). Multidetector-row spiral computed tomography (MDCT) with three-dimensional volume rendering (3-D VR) has significantly improved the imaging of the airways. No previous studies have assessed the accuracy of 3-D VR in determining the degree of airway compression in children due to TB lymphadenopathy. Objective: To compare 3-D VR CT to FTB for the assessment of airway compression due to TB lymphadenopathy in children. Materials and methods: Included in the study were 26 children presenting with symptoms of airway compression caused by pulmonary TB. MDCT of the chest and FTB were performed in all patients. Retrospective 3-D VR reconstruction of the major airways was performed from the original CT raw data and used to evaluate the tracheobronchial tree for site and degree of airway compression and then compared to the FTB findings. FTB was used as the reference standard Results: By FTB 87 sites of airway compression were identified. Using the 3-D VR technique, 138 sites of airway compression were identified, of which 78 (90%) matched with the sites identified by FTB. The sensitivity and specificity of 3-D VR when compared with that of FTB was 92% and 85%, respectively. In four patients (15%), severe narrowing of the bronchus intermedius made FTB evaluation of the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi impossible. VR demonstrated significant distal obstruction in three of these four patients Conclusion: 3-D VR demonstrates a very good correlation with FTB in determining airway compression caused by TB lymphadenopathy in children. In combination with FTB, 3-D VR adds confidence to the bronchoscopy findings and complements FTB by adding additional information on the status of the airway distal to severe obstructions unreachable by FTB.",0,0
2281854,[A modified Macintosh blade with an angulated tip for difficult intubations],"The depth of the proximal part of a normal Macintosh blade was carved more shallow and the tip of the blade was made adjustable in its angle by means of a joint controlled by a screw-lock fixation via a small wire parallel to the blade. Clinical experience with this modified blade in 33 patients is reported. In 10 of 13 patients with severely reduced mouth opening less than or equal to 25 mm and 19 of 20 patients with a mouth opening greater than 25 mm, visibility during laryngoscopy with the modified blade was improved, compared to the normal Macintosh blade. The carved proximal part of the blade improves its maneuverability in a small mouth avoiding undue pressure on the incisors, the adjustable tip increases the blade's pressure on the base of the tongue lifting the epiglottis.",0,0
1474628,The 1991 Fraser Gurd Lecture: evolution of airway control in the management of injured patients,"The evolution of methods for airway control has been an important factor in improving overall trauma care. Many important advances have been made in technique, tubes, and timing. Current methods of airway control are listed in Table 2 and are categorized as emergency or elective. It is always assumed that basic life support techniques will be in place before this hierarchic scheme for airway control is used. Unfortunately, hypoxemia continues to be a factor in preventable trauma deaths. There is much to be done in the future to further improve airway management in injured patients. There is an immediate need to assess methods of airway control in the pre-hospital phase using a randomized clinical trial. The ideal tube for cricothyroidotomy, tracheostomy, or endotracheal intubation remains to be designed. There is a need for further multicenter trials on the timing of tracheostomy in the critical care unit. The role of differential ventilators in the management of unilateral pulmonary parenchymal injury requires clinical validation. Intravascular membrane oxygenators have been proposed in advanced pulmonary insufficiency in a ventilated patient. Thus, while many important strides have been made in airway management following trauma, there remain great challenges in addressing the persistent problem of systemic hypoxemia after multiple injuries.",0,0
11811602,Airway management--when and how?,"Keeping the airway patent and protected is the crucial first step in resuscitation of collapsed patients. The patency of the airway can be maintained by head tilt, chin lift and jaw thrust, with or without the assistance of airway adjunct, for example oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways. Before securing definitive airway by endotracheal intubation, the degree of difficulty for intubation can be predicted using Mallampati, Cormack and Lehane classification. Laryngeal mask airway may have a role in resuscitation. A comprehensive training program must be in place to improve the success rate of the laryngeal mask airway insertion and reduce the complication rate associated with the placement of this device. In order to ensure survival of collapsed patients, all medical and nursing staff must know when and how to manage the airways. ""Do Not Resuscitate"" orders should be written for terminally ill patients to reduce futile resuscitation.",0,0
26343783,Endotracheal tube positioning during neck extension in thyroidectomy,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of body mass index and neck length on endotracheal tube movement during neck extension in thyroidectomy. Methods: A prospective study was conducted of 30 patients undergoing thyroidectomy during an 8-month period. Patient characteristics were recorded and endotracheal tube displacement was determined. Results: Mean body mass index was 27.8 kg/m2 (range, 17.5-34.7 kg/m2) and mean neck circumference was 43.2 cm (range, 28-56 cm). The mean (± standard deviation) upward displacement of the endotracheal tube during neck extension was 7.17 ± 5.87 mm. Patients with a larger body mass index had a significantly greater amount of tube displacement (R2 = 0.67, p < 0.0001), as did patients with a smaller neck length (R2 = 0.48, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Neck extension results in upward displacement of the endotracheal tube. The amount of displacement is significantly higher in patients with a larger body mass index or shorter neck length. This has particular relevance for nerve monitoring in thyroidectomy.",0,0
16768784,Bronchoscopic diagnosis of an extensive tracheal laceration,Tracheal lacerations resulting from endotracheal intubation are extremely rare. We report a case where the initial diagnosis was misled by the radiological findings. Our case uniquely emphasizes several issues pertinent to the management of tracheal lacerations.

17087846,Fibre-optic intubation teaching in sedated patients with anticipated difficult intubation,"Background and objectives: The objective of the study was to assess the safety of training fibre-optic intubation performed under propofol light general anaesthesia in patients with an anticipated difficult intubation. Methods: Patients with ear, nose and throat cancer having at least two criteria for anticipated difficult intubation and scheduled for fibre-optic intubation were included prospectively. In 26 patients, intubation was performed by an anaesthesia resident (under senior supervision), whereas in 20 patients, it was performed by a senior anaesthesiologist. All patients received propofol light general anaesthesia adjusted to maintain both loss of consciousness and spontaneous ventilation. Results: Of the 46 patients, 45 had successful fibre-optic intubation, and one needed a rescue procedure because of hypoxaemia. Residents failed to intubate four patients, who were easily intubated by the senior. Episodic hypoxaemia (SPO2 < 90%) occurred in three patients in each group. No statistically significant difference was found between junior and senior neither on the duration of the procedure (9.3 +/- 4.9 vs. 7.5 +/- 4.0 min) nor on the propofol consumption (197 +/- 130 vs. 193 +/- 103 mg) or the ETCO2 at the end of the procedure (36 +/- 6 vs. 38 +/- 6 mmHg), respectively. Conclusion: Teaching fibre-optic tracheal intubation in patients with anticipated difficult intubation and sedated with propofol did not increase morbidity significantly compared with an experienced anaesthesiologist. Fibre-optic intubation under propofol light general anaesthesia could be safely performed by a resident as long as a senior anaesthesiologist is permanently present, spontaneous ventilation is maintained and a rescue oxygenation technique is immediately available.",0,0
11013469,The palm print as a sensitive predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in diabetics: a comparison with other airway evaluation indices,"Aims: To evaluate the ink impression made by the palm of the dominant hand as a screening tool for difficult laryngoscopy in diabetic patients. Subjects and methods: In this prospective study, airway of 50 adult diabetic patients, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia, was assessed preoperatively using the common clinical indices such as Modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance, degree of head extension and a specific index- the palm print test. Following induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular relaxation, laryngoscopy was performed and the laryngoscopic view scored. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of each airway evaluation index were calculated. Results: The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was 16%. The palm print test had the highest sensitivity (75%) of all the indices. The thyromental distance less than six cm had the highest specificity (95.2%) but was least sensitive (25%). 87% of patients with difficult laryngoscopy had two or more indices abnormal. Conclusion: Though the palm print test was the most sensitive index of the four indices studied, a better prediction of difficult laryngoscopy can be achieved by evaluating all the four airway indices preoperatively.",1,1
18543503,[Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope: experience in 350 cases],"Background: The aim of this study was to describe our experience in managing the new adult color model of the Lo-Pro GlideScope in a diverse group of patients. Material and methods: Prospective, descriptive study of 350 ASA 1-5 patients who underwent oral or nasal tracheal intubation with the Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope. Patients whose maximum mouth opening was inadequate were excluded. We recorded the following data: demographic variables, predictors of difficult direct laryngoscopy, Cormack-Lehane grade, presence of morbid obesity, adjusting maneuvers required, intubations in awake patients, intubations with a selective double lumen tube, rescues of failed intubations, oropharyngeal lesions, postoperative sore throat, and failed intubation. Results: Cormack-Lehane grade was 1 in 80.6% of the cases, 2 in 16.9%, and 3 in 2.6%. There were no Cormack-Lehane 4 patients. Rotation of the tube was necessary when entering the glottis in 38%. There were no significant differences in the incidence of oropharyngeal lesions between oral and nasal intubations. There were no abandoned attempts. Conclusions: The rate of successful tracheal intubation is high with the new Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope when it is used by trained staff, even in patients with difficult airways. It is also a useful device for intubating awake patients.",0,0
10793528,[Use of intubating laryngeal mask airway for three patients with difficult intubation],"We used intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILM) for three patients with difficult intubation, and tracheal intubation was successfully performed through the ILM in all three cases. Difficult intubation in the first case was caused by direct invasion of malignant lymphoma into the right maxillary sinus leading to restricted mouth opening. Neck stiffness due to invasion of metastatic cancer into the cervical spine in the second case and facial trauma caused by traffic accident in the third case gave rise to the difficult intubation. Insertion of the ILM was successfully performed in all the patients following induction of general anesthesia, and the ventilation through the ILM was possible without any difficulties. Subsequently, all patients were intubated through the ILM successfully. We realized that the ILM is useful and should be prepared on the induction of anesthesia in patients suspected of difficult intubation.",0,0
15805890,Sleep endoscopy versus modified Mallampati score in sleep apnea and snoring,"Objectives/hypothesis: The aim of this study is to quantify the correlation between a large tongue classified by the modified Mallampati score (MMS) and obstruction at the tongue base observed during sleep endoscopy in patients with socially unacceptable snoring (SUS) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Study design: Prospective. Methods: One hundred twenty-seven patients with obstructive sleep apnea and SUS underwent sleep endoscopy. Patients were classified into four specific groups according to their MMS. After intravenous administration of midazolam, obstructive events in the upper airway were classified. The level of obstruction was expressed as palatal (2), palatal and to a lesser degree base of the tongue/laryngeal level (2), tongue base/laryngeal level and to a lesser degree palatal (3), and tongue base/laryngeal level (3). The degree of correlation between the level of obstruction and the MMS was analyzed by means of Spearman's rank-order correlation. Results: No linear association between the level of obstruction and MMS could be found. A large tongue (MMS 3 or 4) does not predict obstruction at the base of the tongue. Patients classified as MMS 1 or 2 did not frequently show obstruction at the base of the tongue (9 of 38, 23,6%). The majority of the population showed retropalatal obstruction. A large tongue (MMS 3 or 4) was often accompanied by retropalatal obstruction, 76% of the cases (64 of 89). Conclusions: No positive correlation exists between a large tongue and obstruction at tongue base level. In both groups, retropalatal obstruction occurred more often than retrolingual obstruction. Sleep endoscopy provides qualitative insight into important changes during sleep in patients with SUS and OSAS. In addition, anatomic aberrations are clearly visualized in a dynamic setting. Classification of the size of the tongue, as assessed by the MMS, may be of great importance as well.",0,0
21304457,A novel rescue technique for difficult intubation and difficult ventilation,"We describe a novel non surgical technique to maintain oxygenation and ventilation in a case of difficult intubation and difficult ventilation, which works especially well with poor mask fit. Can not intubate, can not ventilate"" (CICV) is a potentially life threatening situation. In this video we present a simulation of the technique we used in a case of CICV where oxygenation and ventilation were maintained by inserting an endotracheal tube (ETT) nasally down to the level of the naso-pharynx while sealing the mouth and nares for successful positive pressure ventilation. A 13 year old patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage of a neck abscess and direct laryngobronchoscopy. After preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced intravenously. Mask ventilation was found to be extremely difficult because of the swelling of the soft tissue. The face mask could not fit properly on the face due to significant facial swelling as well. A direct laryngoscopy was attempted with no visualization of the larynx. Oxygen saturation was difficult to maintain, with saturations falling to 80%. In order to oxygenate and ventilate the patient, an endotracheal tube was then inserted nasally after nasal spray with nasal decongestant and lubricant. The tube was pushed gently and blindly into the hypopharynx. The mouth and nose of the patient were sealed by hand and positive pressure ventilation was possible with 100% O2 with good oxygen saturation during that period of time. Once the patient was stable and well sedated, a rigid bronchoscope was introduced by the otolaryngologist showing extensive subglottic and epiglottic edema, and a mass effect from the abscess, contributing to the airway compromise. The airway was secured with an ETT tube by the otolaryngologist.This video will show a simulation of the technique on a patient undergoing general anesthesia for dental restorations.",0,0
25221769,"A comparison of between hyomental distance ratios, ratio of height to thyromental, modified Mallamapati classification test and upper lip bite test in predicting difficult laryngoscopy of patients undergoing general anesthesia","Background: Failed intubation is imperative source of anesthetic interrelated patient's mortality. The aim of this present study was to compare the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx from the following pre-operative airway predictive indices, in isolation and combination: Modified Mallampati test (MMT), the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD), hyomental distance ratios (HMDR), and the upper-lip-bite test (ULBT). Materials and methods: We collected data on 525 consecutive patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation and then evaluated all four factors before surgery. A skilled anesthesiologist, not imparted of the noted pre-operative airway assessment, did the laryngoscopy and rating (as per Cormack and Lehane's classification). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for every airway predictor in isolation and in combination were established. Results: The most sensitive of the single tests was ULBT with a sensitivity of 90.2%. The hyomental distance extreme of head extension was the least sensitive of the single tests with a sensitivity of 56.9. The HMDR had sensitivity 86.3%. The ULBT had the highest negative predictive value: And the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC curve) among single predictors. The AUC of ROC curve for ULBT, HMDR and RHTMD was significantly more than for MMT (P < 0.05). No significant difference was noted in the AUC of ROC curve for ULBT, HMDR, and RHTMD (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The HMDR is comparable with RHTMD and ULBT for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in the general population, but was significantly more than for MMT.",1,1
25540067,Advanced airway management is necessary in prehospital trauma patients,"Background: Treatment of airway compromise in trauma patients is a priority. Basic airway management is provided by all emergency personnel, but the requirement for on-scene advanced airway management is controversial. We attempted to establish the demand for on-scene advanced airway interventions. Trauma patients managed with standard UK paramedic airway interventions were assessed to determine whether airway compromise had been effectively treated or whether more advanced airway management was required. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted to identify trauma patients requiring prehospital advanced airway management attended by a doctor-paramedic team. The team assessed and documented airway compromise on arrival, interventions performed before and after their arrival, and their impact on airway compromise. Results: Four hundred and seventy-two patients required advanced airway intervention and received 925 airway interventions by ground-based paramedics. Two hundred and sixty-nine patients (57%) still had airway compromise on arrival of the enhanced care team; no oxygen had been administered to 52 patients (11%). There were 45 attempted intubations by ground paramedics with a 64% success rate and 11% unrecognized oesophageal intubation rate. Doctor-paramedic teams delivering prehospital anaesthesia achieved definitive airway management for all patients. Conclusions: A significant proportion of severely injured trauma patients required advanced airway interventions to effectively treat airway compromise. Standard ambulance service interventions were only effective for a proportion of patients, but might not have always been applied appropriately. Complications of advanced airway management occurred in both provider groups, but failed intubation and unrecognized oesophageal intubation were a particular problem in the paramedic intubation group.",0,0

Patients: Twenty patients who were undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy from May 2009 to July 2009. Measurements and main results: Thirteen patients underwent bronchoscopy via the oral and nasal approach, 2 via a tracheostomy, and 5 via an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway. The scope was also used in the placement of a percutaneous tracheostomy tube and in the operating room for 3 procedural endotracheal intubations. The overall performance of mobile bronchoscope was satisfactory. The majority of difficulties encountered by the bronchoscopists came from the performance of the monitor. The main issue was the need to turn the screen to view the image in an upright position. Conclusions: The Airway Mobile Scope is well suited for airway examination and interventions often needed in emergency rooms, intensive care units, operating rooms, and office settings. The ease of use of the bronchoscope could be enhanced with small changes to the display of the image on the LCD screen.",0,0
26186767,Facial Image Analysis for Fully Automatic Prediction of Difficult Endotracheal Intubation,"Goal: Difficult tracheal intubation is a major cause of anesthesia-related injuries with potential life threatening complications. Detection and anticipation of difficult airway in the preoperative period is, thus, crucial for the patients' safety. We propose an automatic face-analysis approach to detect morphological traits related to difficult intubation and improve its prediction. Methods: For this purpose, we have collected a database of 970 patients including photos, videos, and ground truth data. Specific statistical face models have been learned using the faces in our database providing an automated parametrization of the facial morphology. The most discriminative morphological features are selected through the importance ranking provided by the random forest algorithm. The random forest approach has also been used to train a classifier on these selected features. We compare a threshold tuning method based on class prior with two methods, which learn an optimal threshold on a training set for tackling the inherent imbalanced nature of the database. Results: Our fully automated method achieves an AUC of 81.0% in a simplified experimental setup, where only easy and difficult patients are considered. A further validation on the entire database has proven that our method is applicable for real-world difficult intubation prediction, with AUC = 77.9%. Conclusion: The system performance is in line with the state-of-the-art medical diagnosis, based on ratings provided by trained anesthesiologists, whose assessment is guided by an extensive set of criteria. Significance: We present the first completely automatic and noninvasive difficult intubation detection system that is suitable for use in clinical settings.",0,0
10932687,Comparison between two different propofol dosage regimens for insertion of cuffed oro-pharyngeal airway,"Conditions for insertion of the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) were assessed following two different dosage regimens of propofol: group I (n = 40): 1.5 mg.kg-1; group II (n = 40): 2.5 mg.kg-1. The insertion conditions were evaluated by using a scoring system (-, + and +2) of gag and cough reflexes. The necessary use of additional dosage of propofol and the duration of post-induction apnea were also recorded. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of coughing, gagging and the additional usage of induction agent. The mean (+/- SD) duration of apnea was significantly longer in the high dose group: 9 +/- 6 min vs 5 +/- 7 min (p = 0.007). Low dose of propofol combines efficient insertion conditions with decreased length of post-induction apnea.",0,0
9229740,[Relationship between laryngoscopy degree and intubation difficulty],"Objectives: To determine the relation between difficult intubation and grade of direct laryngoscopy, as well as the factors that influence them, and prognosis. Patients and method: In 1,336 patients receiving general anesthesia, seven airway measurements were made to reflect degree of difficulty and predictive value of presurgical tests on direct laryngoscopy and intubation. Results: The incidences of difficult laryngoscopic and intubation procedures were 1.4 and 3.0%, respectively. Difficult intubation was more frequent in women and in patients between 40 and 65 years of age (p < 0.05). In 105 intubations (64.8%) performed with moderate difficulty (use of a stylette, external laryngeal pressure or two tries) and 17 (41.5%) performed with difficulty (three or more tries), the laryngoscopic procedure was graded as easy (Cormack-Lehane grade I-II). In these cases (easy laryngoscopy with moderate/difficult intubation), the causes recorded were size of endotracheal tube in comparison with the laryngeal opening (n = 11); anterior glotis (n = 36); insufficient relaxation (n = 31); disease in or beyond the vocal cords (n = 29); or undetermined (n = 15). In the easy intubation cases, the laryngoscopic procedures were grade III in 2.9%. Intubation was difficult in 16.3% (n = 39) of patients presenting some type of abnormality upon examination of the airway (p < 0.05). The airway characteristic that best predicted laryngoscopic difficulty was extension of the lower neck to 90 degrees (relative risk of 4.46), mouth opening less than 3.5 cm (3.92), presence of two airway abnormalities (4.25) and presence of three or more abnormalities (5.39) (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The fact that cases of easy laryngoscopy coincide with difficult intubation suggests that, to the degree of intubation difficulty must be added extrinsic factors (individual skill, maneuvers performed, instrumentation, relaxation of the laryngeal musculature and others) that are hard to standardize and reflect when predicting an intubation by the grade of difficulty in laryngoscopy.",0,0
17056964,Craniocervical extension improves the specificity and predictive value of the Mallampati airway evaluation,"Background: The modified Mallampati (MMP) classification is a standard airway examination that assesses mouth opening and structures within the oral cavity. Recent data suggest that maximal mouth opening (as measured by interdental distance) is possible only with extension of the craniocervical junction. Because the MMP examination is performed with the head in a neutral position, the airway may appear worse because of submaximal interdental distance. We hypothesized that adding craniocervical extension to the MMP would allow for greater mouth opening, lower scores, and less false positives than the traditional MMP examination. Methods: Multiple clinicians with at least 1 yr of airway experience evaluated adult airways (n = 60) with the MMP examination (with head in neutral position). The same examination was then repeated with the addition of craniocervical extension (Extended Mallampati Score, EMS). Results: On average, craniocervical extension decreased the MMP class (P < 0.002). The EMS improved specificity from 70% to 80% and positive predictive value from 24% to 31% when compared with the traditional MMP. The sensitivity (83%) was the same for MMP and EMS. Conclusions: Craniocervical extension improves the specificity and positive predictive value of the MMP airway evaluation while retaining sensitivity of the traditional MMP examination. The introduction of the EMS into clinical practice should be considered.",0,0
10927992,Thyroid disease,"In summary, disease of the thyroid gland is common. Anaesthetists will be required to manage patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and those requiring thyroidectomy. Since anaesthesia for thyroidectomy provides many challenges of airway management, the anaesthetist should pay particular attention to preoperative assessment of the airway and should be able to deal with acute airway complications in the perioperative phase.",0,0
24247414,Collaborative intervention to improve airway assessment and safety in management for anaesthesia: the Qualitat & Via Aèria (QUAVA) study,"Background: Airway assessment and management are cornerstones of anaesthesia, yet airway complications remain an important source of morbidity. Objective: We performed a before-and-after evaluation of a collaborative intervention to improve adherence to airway assessment and management guidelines in patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia. Design: A prospective, multicentre before-and-after evaluation of a collaborative intervention. Setting: Collaborative intervention to improve adherence to airway assessment and management guidelines in patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia. Data were collected on 21 consecutive days before and after the intervention. Participants: Anaesthetists with staff or residency positions at 22 hospitals. Patients aged 18 years or older undergoing nonemergency surgery were recruited. Intervention: Establishing a learning network that included local leaders, meetings to share experiences and knowledge, interactive sessions and provision of printed materials on airway assessment and management. Clinical airway management for general anaesthesia was provided by the anaesthetists participating in the study. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were the completion of airway assessment at the preanaesthetic visit, rates of unanticipated difficult airway, algorithm adherence and related airway complications. Results: The study included 3753 patients (1947 preintervention and 1806 postintervention). The percentage of patients with a complete airway assessment increased from 25.1% preintervention to 48.4% postintervention (P <0.001). The incidences of unanticipated difficult airway were 4.1% before the intervention and 3% after it (P = 0.433). Rates of adherence to the algorithms for anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway management were similar in the two periods. The incidences of related adverse events were also similar. Conclusion: The collaborative intervention was effective in improving airway assessment but not in changing difficult airway management practices.",0,0
20191771,Airway assessment based on a three column model of direct laryngoscopy,"Airway assessment has remained a problematic area, largely due to the low sensitivities, specificities and/or positive predictive values of most bedside tests. In this paper a structured overview of the common preoperative airway assessment tests is presented, based on a model for direct laryngoscopy that has been previously described. This model is composed of three columns: anterior middle and posterior The anterior column tests are classified into the assessment of volume and compliance of the submandibular space, the range of movement of the temporomandibular joints and the flexibility of the stylohyoid ligament. Reductions in volume of the anterior column may be absolute or relative. An absolute reduction may occur with shortening of either the incisor-hyoid distance, the temporomandibular joint-incisor distance or the temporomandibular joint-temporomandibular joint distance. A relative reduction may be seen with either prominent upper front incisors or large tongues. Testing of the middle column includes a history and physical examination of the upper respiratory system, imaging of the airway (such as X-ray, computed tomography scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans) and nasopharyngoscopy. The posterior column may be assessed by the range of movement of the neck, especially the range of extension of the occipito-atlanto-axial complex. By integrating common tests of the anterior middle and posterior columns within this three-column model, the practitioner may be better positioned to understand the complexity of direct laryngoscopy in both normal and difficult airway scenarios.",0,0
16116830,Oncological outcome after CO2 laser cordectomy for early-stage glottic carcinoma,"This study aims to define indications for micro-endoscopic laser surgery in early glottic carcinoma (Tis, T1a and T1b), to examine patterns of local recurrences and related retreatment methods. A cohort of 79 patients with previously untreated early glottic carcinoma, subjected to endoscopic CO2 laser excision between January 1993 and October 2000, was retrospectively examined. Patients included in data analysis had a mean follow-up of 39 months. Depth and extension of excisions were graded according to European Laryngological Society Classification, and included 5 types of cordectomy. Actuarial overall survival, determinate survival, disease-free survival, ultimate local control, and laryngeal preservation rates, at 3 years, were 97.5%, 98.7%, 89.9%, 92.4%, and 97.4%, respectively. Survival curves for overall and disease-free survival were calculated from the date of diagnosis using the KaplanMeier method. Of the 8 patients with local recurrences, 5 were managed with larynx-sparing treatment: a second endoscopic CO, laser cordectomy was performed in 2 patients, a supracricoid laryngectomy in 2 patients, and one patient was treated with radiotherapy. The remaining 3 patients were submitted to total laryngectomy, one of whom died due to neck metastases. One patient died from other causes. All other patients were alive and disease-free at the last follow-up. Understanding the diffusion pathways and timing of laryngeal glottic cancer is important both for treatment and prognosis. Correct knowledge of the subsites of the larynx and the routine use of pre-operative and intra-operative diagnostic assessment is useful in the selection of the appropriate type of resection. Microendoscopic laser surgery is efficacious for early glottic carcinoma, with oncological results comparable to those observed following radiotherapy or conventional partial laryngectomy, however, in this case, local recurrences have a greater range of re-treatment options.",0,0
27190925,Innovative Application of a Microlaryngeal Surgery Tube for difficult Airway Management in a Case of Down's Syndrome,"An 11-year-old male child, known case of down's syndrome with congenital oesophageal stricture was posted for oesophageal dilatation. Preoperative airway assessment revealed a high arched palate, receding mandible and Mallampati Score of 2. During surgery, after loss of consciousness which was described as loss of eyelash reflex and adequate jaw relaxation, direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation was attempted with a cuffed endotracheal tube number 5.0mm ID (internal diameter). The endotracheal tube could not be negotiated smoothly, so 5.0mm ID uncuffed endotracheal tube was used which passed through easily, but on auscultation revealed a significant leak. Later, intubation via a Micro Laryngeal Surgery (MLS) cuffed tube 4.0mm ID was attempted. The MLS tube advanced smoothly and there was no associated leak on positive pressure ventilation. Thus by innovative thinking and avant-garde reasoning, a definitive airway device could be positioned with no other suitable alternative at hand.",0,0
12401644,The upside-down intubating laryngeal mask airway: a technique for cases of fixed flexed neck deformity,"When the neck is fixed in extreme flexion, access to the windpipe becomes very difficult. The intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) appears unsuitable for guiding the breathing tube into the windpipe in such cases because of its rigid, preformed shape. However, the ILMA introduced upside down may provide the answer, even if the mouth opening is smaller than normal.",0,0
1416135,Tracheal intubation without the use of muscle relaxants: a technique using propofol and varying doses of alfentanil,"We have noted that tracheal intubation can be accomplished in many patients after induction of anesthesia with propofol and alfentanil without the simultaneous use of muscle relaxants. This study was designed to evaluate airway and intubating conditions after administration of propofol and alfentanil in 75 ASA physical status I or II outpatients with Mallampati class I airways undergoing various surgical procedures. The patients were randomly assigned to one of five groups for induction of anesthesia. All patients received midazolam 1 mg IV before induction of anesthesia. Group I patients (n = 15) received d-tubocurarine 3 mg, thiamylal 4 mg/kg, and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV. Groups II-V patients (n = 15 each) received alfentanil 30, 40, 50, or 60 micrograms/kg followed by propofol 2 mg/kg IV. No muscle relaxants were given to patients in groups II-V. Airway management was performed by one of the authors who was blinded as to the dose of alfentanil administered. After loss of consciousness, patients' lungs were ventilated via face mask, and the ease of ventilation was recorded. Jaw mobility was also assessed. Ninety seconds after administration of the propofol or thiamylal, laryngoscopy was performed and exposure of the glottis and position of the vocal cords were noted. Intubation of the trachea was performed and patient response was noted. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were also recorded before induction of anesthesia, after induction, and then again after intubation of the trachea. The lungs of all patients were easily ventilated via mask, and the jaw was judged to be relaxed in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
25712988,Tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce mesenchymal stem cell-mediated resistance in BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used as a frontline therapy for BCR-ABL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, resistance to TKI therapy arises rapidly, and its underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel cascade of events initiated by TKIs and traversing through mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to leukemic cells, leading to resistance. MSCs exposed to TKIs acquired a new functional status with the expression of genes encoding for chemo-attractants, adhesion molecules, and prosurvival growth factors, and this priming enabled leukemic cells to form clusters underneath the MSCs. This cluster formation was associated with the protection of ALL cells from therapy as leukemic cells switched from BCR-ABL signaling to IL-7R/Janus kinase signaling to survive in the MSC milieu. Our findings illustrate a novel perspective in the evolution of TKI resistance and provide insights for advancing the treatment of BCR-ABL(+) ALL.",0,0
18187998,Tonsillar lipoma causing difficult intubation: a case report,"A 63-year-old woman with confusion and disorientation was referred to the Pulmonary Medicine Department of Afyon Kocatepe University. She was uncooperative and her peripheral oxygen saturation was 75%. She was on diuretic therapy for heart failure. An emergency intubation was planned due to the development of respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, but the patient could not be intubated. After several attempts, intubation was successful only by digital manipulation of a lateral pharyngeal mass noticed incidentally. She was inadvertently extubated on the third day of intubation and an emergency tracheotomy was performed. Otolaryngological examination revealed a mass originating from the right palatine tonsil, and a computed tomography scan showed a hypodense mass extending from the uvula to the epiglottis. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent a right tonsillectomy and a lipomatous mass (3.6x3.2x2.2 cm) and the palatine tonsil (3.5x1.1x0.8 cm) were resected. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of mature adipocytes with thin fibrous septae. It should be borne in mind that patients may be unaware of a tonsillar mass that may lead to serious dyspnea and difficult intubation.",0,0
19396507,Effect of manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine in adults on the rate of difficult orotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy: a randomized controlled trial,"Purpose: Although manual in-line stabilization (MILS) is commonly used during endotracheal intubation in patients with either known or suspected cervical spine instability, the effect of MILS on orotracheal intubation is poorly documented. This study evaluated the rate of failed tracheal intubation in a fixed time interval with MILS. Methods: Two hundred elective surgical patients were randomized into two groups. In the MILS group, the patient's head was stabilized in a neutral position by grasping the patient's mastoid processes to minimize any head movement during tracheal intubation. In the control group, the patient's head rested in an optimal position for tracheal intubation. A 30-sec period was allowed to complete tracheal intubation with a #3 Macintosh laryngoscope blade. The primary endpoint was the rate of failed tracheal intubation at 30 sec. Secondary endpoints included tracheal intubation time and the Cormack & Lehane grade of laryngoscopy. Results: Patient characteristics were similar with respect to demographic data and risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation. The rate of failed tracheal intubation at 30 sec was 50% (47/94) in the MILS group compared to 5.7% (6/105) in the control group (P < 0.0001). Laryngoscopic grades 3 and 4 were more frequently observed in the MILS group. Mean times for successful tracheal intubation were 15.8 +/- 8.5 sec and 8.7 +/- 4.6 sec for the MILS and control groups, respectively (mean difference 7.1, CI(95%) 5.0-9.3, P < 0.0001). All patients who failed tracheal intubation in the MILS group were successfully intubated when MILS was removed. Conclusion: In patients with otherwise normal airways, MILS increases the tracheal intubation failure rate at 30 sec and worsens laryngeal visualization during direct laryngoscopy.",0,0
24105784,Airway algorithm for the management of patients with a King LT,"Objectives/hypothesis: To discuss an algorithm for managing the airway in patients presenting with a King LT in place. Study design: Case series at a single institution with planned chart review. Methods: This study reviewed the management of three patients who presented to a tertiary academic medical facility emergency department following placement of a King LT at an outside hospital or in the field. Clinical history at admission as well as each patient's hospital course was evaluated. We discuss the management of the airway in each of these cases and use these to help design an algorithm for improving outcomes in patients with a King LT in place. Results: In each of the three cases presented, the Otolaryngology Department was consulted for definitive airway management. In two of these patients, the airway was successfully secured using endotracheal intubation. Only one patient required tracheostomy. We discuss an algorithm for managing these patients to obtain a safe airway, which includes assessing the airway with flexible endoscopy and then proceeding with intubation by the Seldinger technique or intubation using a video laryngoscope. In some cases, tracheostomy will be required to definitively secure the airway. Conclusions: The King LT is a valuable tool available in the field to help to temporarily secure the airway. Otolaryngologists should have an appropriate airway algorithm for managing patients with a King LT in place to minimize the need for a tracheostomy.",0,0
24842175,"Is video laryngoscope-assisted flexible tracheoscope intubation feasible for patients with predicted difficult airway? A prospective, randomized clinical trial","Background: Failed intubation may result in both increased morbidity and mortality. The combination of a video laryngoscope and a flexible tracheoscope used as a flexible video stylet may improve the success rate of securing a difficult airway. We tested the hypothesis that this combination is a feasible way to facilitate intubation in patients with a predicted difficult airway in that it will shorten intubation times and reduce the number of intubation attempts. Methods: We conducted a randomized, prospective trial in 140 patients with anticipated difficult airways undergoing elective or urgent surgery. After insertion of video laryngoscope, patients were randomly assigned to either having their tube placed with the use of a preformed stylet (control group) or with a flexible tracheoscope (intervention group). The primary outcome measures were time to successful intubation and number of intubation attempts. Results: The number of intubations requiring 2 or more intubation attempts was similar in the 2 groups (14% control vs 13% intervention, P = 1.0); the number of patients requiring 3 or more intubation attempts was not significantly different (8.6% control vs 1.4% intervention, P = 0.12). Distribution for time to intubation also did not differ between the control (median of 66 seconds, interquartile range 47-89) and the intervention group (median of 71 seconds, interquartile range 52-100; P = 0.35). In the control group, 4 patients, all with cervical spine pathology, had the trachea intubated successfully with the video laryngoscope plus flexible tracheoscope after 3 failed attempts with video laryngoscope and rigid stylet. For these 4 patients, time from the decision to change the intubation method to successful intubation with a flexible tracheoscope was 36 ± 14 seconds. Overall success probability for cervical spine patients was 100% (20/20) in the intervention group and 80% (16/20) in the control group, with an exact 95% confidence interval for the difference of 1.4% to 44%, P = 0.04. Conclusions: Flexible tracheoscope-assisted video laryngoscopic intubation is a feasible alternative to video laryngoscope only intubation in patients with predicted difficult airways. A flexible tracheoscope used in combination with video laryngoscope may also further increase the success rate of intubation in select patients with a proven difficult airway, particularly when in-line stabilization is required.",0,0
9389866,Unsuspected difficult intubation caused by a laryngeal web,"We report a case of unsuspected difficult intubation in an adult caused by laryngeal web formation in the anterior commissure of the larynx. After induction of anaesthesia, most parts of the posterior commissure of the vocal cords were seen clearly at laryngoscopy, but a 7.5-mm internal diameter (id) tracheal tube could not be advanced below the level of the vocal cords because of resistance. Intubation was re-attempted several times after oxygenation by mask with trials of smaller tubes. Finally, a 5.0-mm id cuffed tube was passed successfully through the vocal cords, and secured in place. Because of the unexpected difficulties in intubation, an otolaryngologist was consulted to examine the larynx with a microscope. A web of 0.5 cm in the anterior commissures was found which caused subglottic stenosis.",0,0
26460721,Nasotracheal intubation in patients with limited mouth opening: a comparison between fibreoptic intubation and the Trachway®,"In patients with limited mouth opening, traditional laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopes are not useful when performing nasotracheal intubation. Eighty patients with limited mouth opening who required nasotracheal intubation were randomly assigned to either fibreoptic intubation (n = 40) or the Trachway(®) (n = 40). Using the modified nasal intubation difficulty scale, 22 (55%) patients who received fibreoptic intubation were categorised as no difficulty compared with 40 (100%) patients in the Trachway group (p < 0.001). Mean (SD) total intubation time was 71.8 (23.3) s in patients who received fibreoptic intubation compared with 35.4 (9.8) s in the Trachway group (p < 0.001). We conclude that the Trachway technique for nasotracheal intubation is quicker and easier compared with fibreoptic intubation in patients with limited mouth opening.",0,0

Awake nasotracheal intubation was performed under conscious sedation with propofol and fentanyl. After positioning the tip of the EndoFlex tube in the oropharynx, the fiberoptic bronchoscope was inserted into the tube until the tip reached the bevel of the tube. Anterior flexion of the distal tip of the EndoFlex tube facilitated uncomplicated insertion of the tube into the trachea without impingement on the arytenoids. Fiberoptic visualization confirmed that the distal-tip flexing mechanism of the EndoFlex tube corrected the direction of the tube tip anteriorly, allowing entry into the trachea. We present a case where this technique proved valuable for tracheal intubation in a patient with limitations of mouth opening and neck movement.",0,0
26670262,Radical evolution: the 2015 Difficult Airway Society guidelines for managing unanticipated difficult or failed tracheal intubation,"There is little doubt that these guidelines incorporate advances made in airway management since 2004. They will change day-to-day practice of anaesthesia, as outlined above, from pre-operative airway assessment, to integrating the WHO team briefing, to the use and provision of equipment and drugs, and the recording of information on the anaesthesia chart. They will inform the later analysis of any critical airway incidents, especially as documentation and postoperative management are addressed, and they will encourage training in a range of techniques. Taken together, not quite a revolution but certainly a very 'radical evolution'.Assessment of the utility of the new guidelines should consider if they can be used as tools to enhance knowledge and training, or in addition as a prosthesis to bridge the gap between the requirements of and our abilities during emergencies. Formal testing may reveal which aspects of their design, complex as it is, may distract from, rather than enhance, airway management during crises.All guidelines represent a standard of care or a normative approach to a clinical problem. As such, they not only help guide clinicians, but they also provide the broader community with the opportunity to improve standards, to ensure equipment is available, and that training for the skills and processes required are in place to ensure successful adoption.",0,0
22475762,Predictors of a difficult intubation in the bariatric patient: does preoperative body mass index matter?,"Background: The incidence of difficult intubations in morbidly obese patients has been reported to be 12-20%; however, no well-established predictors of a difficult intubation exist for this patient population. Our objective was to evaluate the factors associated with a difficult intubation in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at an integrated multispecialty health system with a 325-bed community teaching hospital serving 19 counties. Methods: The anesthetic records of patients undergoing LRYGB from 2001 to 2010 were reviewed. Difficult intubations were defined as direct laryngoscopy graded ≥1 on a 0-2 difficulty scale and unplanned fiberoptic intubations. Statistical analysis included chi-square, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 915 consecutive patients underwent LRYGB during the study period. Of these, 3 patients were excluded because of incomplete data. Of the 912 included patients, 25 (2.7%) underwent planned fiberoptic intubation, 830 (91%) had an uneventful intubation, and 57 (6.3%) had a difficult intubation. Difficult intubations were more common in men than in women (11% versus 6%, P = .027). Difficult intubations were not associated with an increasing preoperative body mass index (P = .073), the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (P = .784), or the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (P = .335). Multivariate predictors of a difficult intubation were Mallampati class 4 (odds ratio [OR] 2.76, P = .035), abnormal thyromental distance (OR 4.39, P = .001), restricted jaw mobility (OR 3.26, P = .018), and a history of a difficult intubation (OR 4.17, P = .002). Conclusions: An increased Mallampati class, abnormal thyromental distance, restricted jaw mobility, and a history of difficult intubations were independent predictors of a difficult intubation. An increasing body mass index did not predict for a difficult intubation.",0,0
23251996,Infection control practices of laryngoscope blades: a review of the literature,"Current procedures for cleaning anesthesia airway equipment as assessed by the presence of visible and occult blood on laryngoscope blades and handles as labeled ""ready for patient use"" has been reported to be ineffective. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are 2 commonly seen pathogens that frequently are found in the healthcare setting. It has been shown that HBV can survive on a dry surface for at least 7 days and both HIV and HBV are transmitted via blood. The potential for cross-contamination from airway equipment to patient has been shown in several studies. To prevent further potential infections, it should be ascertained why anesthesia providers are not all using disposable laryngoscope blades. The purpose of this literature review is to determine the use and infection control practices of disposable laryngoscope blades. Their frequency of use, their evaluation of ease of use, and any complications encountered when using the disposable blade are reviewed, as well as the perceptions of anesthesia providers regarding disposable laryngoscope blades.",0,0

7834587,Difficult intubation: are you prepared for it?,The endotracheal intubation of a patient for surgery requires an anaesthetist who is aided by a skilled and experienced helper. This paper explores reasons why some patients are difficult to intubate. Some are predictable on pre-operative assessment and others are not. Suggestions are given on how the helper is useful to the anaesthetist in this potentially critical situation.,0,0
18378968,Brief report: tracheal intubation using the Bonfils intubation fibrescope or direct laryngoscopy for patients with a simulated difficult airway,"Background: The Bonfils intubation fibrescope (BIF), a rigid, straight and reusable fibreoptic device, is being used increasingly to facilitate endotracheal intubation after direct laryngoscopy has failed. We tested the hypothesis that, with the BIF compared to direct laryngoscopy, the rate of failed endotracheal intubation could be reduced in patients with a difficult airway, simulated by means of a rigid cervical immobilization collar. Methods: Seventy-six adults undergoing elective gynecological surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to have endotracheal intubation, facilitated with either a standard size 3 Macintosh laryngoscope blade, or the BIF. A rigid cervical immobilization collar was used to simulate a difficult airway, by reducing mouth opening and limiting neck extension. If endotracheal intubation could not be achieved within two attempts, the cervical collar was removed, and direct laryngoscopy was performed thereafter, using a Macintosh blade in all subjects. The success rate of endotracheal tube placement was the primary outcome variable. Results: Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. After neck immobilization, the inter-incisor distance was reduced to 2.6 +/- 0.7 cm (Macintosh) and 2.6 +/- 0.8 cm (BIF). Tube placement was successful in 15/38 (39.5%) patients with a Macintosh blade, and in 31/38 patients with the BIF (81.6%; P = 0.0003). Time required for tube placement was 53 +/- 22 sec (Macintosh) and 64 +/- 24 sec (BIF; P = 0.15). Conclusion: The Bonfils intubation fibrescope is a more effective intubating device for patients with immobilized cervical spine and significantly limited inter-incisor distance, when compared to direct laryngoscopy.",0,0
15117468,Determination of the changes in the hypoglossal nerve function after suspension laryngoscopy with needle electromyography of the tongue,"The purpose of this study was to determine changes in the hypoglossal nerve function after suspension laryngoscopy with needle electromyography of the tongue. This study also attempted to determine the possible relationship between the predictive factors of intubation difficulty by using the intubation difficulty scale, which was introduced by Adnet et al., duration of suspension laryngoscopy and changes in hypoglossal nerve function after suspension laryngoscopy. The study was performed on 39 patients who underwent suspension laryngoscopy for benign glottic pathology. Pre-operative airway assessment was evaluated by the intubation difficulty scale and the duration of suspension laryngoscopy was recorded. Needle electromyography of the tongue was performed three or four weeks after the suspension laryngoscopy. After needle electromyography of the tongue, increased polyphasia was found in 13 patients (33 per cent), bilaterally in three of them. The interference pattern was reduced in two of these 13 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in predictive factors of intubation difficulty and the duration of the operation between these 13 patients with increased polyphasia and the remaining 26 patients with completely normal electromyography findings. These findings show that, in spite of normal clinical tongue function, subclinical changes can be detected by needle electromyography of the tongue after suspension laryngoscopy.",0,0
23330426,Airway management disasters--lessons from the United Kingdom,"The Fourth National Audit Project (NAP4) was set up by the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society to provide an insight into major complications of airway management in the United Kingdom. The NAP4 found that one serious airway complication such as death, brain damage, the need for surgical airway or unexpected intensive care admission, was reported for every 5500 general anaesthetics. Most of the events happened during daytime to a senior experienced clinicians. Airway assessment was not recorded before surgery in 74% of patients that ended up with life threatening airway complications. Aspiration was responsible for 26% of life threatening airway complications and for 50% of all deaths. The NAP4 found that airway problems were twice as common in obese patients (BMI 30-35) and four times as common in morbidly obese (BMI >35). Awake fibreoptic intubation was indicated and not performed in a significant number of reported incidents. Thirty percent of serious airway complications were associated with extubation or removal of laryngeal mask airway at the end of anaesthesia. The findings of the NAP4 have the potential to significantly influence airway management practice of all anaesthetists irrespective of where in the world they practice anaesthesia.",0,0
8342749,[A difficult intubation: prolapse of the epiglottis into the trachea in an infant],"Luxation of the epiglottic cartilage is a very uncommon complication of endotracheal intubation in paediatric anaesthesia. We report on a case of prolapse of the epiglottic cartilage into the trachea in a 4-month-old child who had been anaesthetized for palliative banding of the pulmonary artery and correction of a coarctation of the aorta. Further malformations included a single ventricle combined with an ASD II and VSD. The first intubation (ID 3.5 mm) via the nasopharyngeal route seemed not to involve any problems; breathing pressure, however, increased to 25 cm H2O. Direct laryngoscopy after extubation of the smaller tube and insertion of another one (ID 4.0 mm) demonstrated a completely blocked trachea. The epiglottidean cartilage had prolapsed into the tracheal lumen and excluded any possibility of ventilating the patient. After seizing the epiglottic cartilage with a Magill forceps it was possible to pull the cartilage out of the trachea and to intubate again with the 4.0 mm tube. There were no complications in the postoperative period.",0,0
18958435,"[Anesthesiological co-diagnosis ""difficult intubation"": effects on the reimbursement situation of a university hospital]","Objective: Within the German diagnosis related groups (G-DRG) system, the accurate coding of the co-morbidity ""failed or difficult intubation (T88.4)"" may be relevant with respect to reimbursement. In this study, the impact of this typical anesthesia co-morbidity on revenues of an university hospital was investigated. Methods: The computerized records of 21,204 anesthesia procedures from the year 2005 were scanned for failed or difficult intubations. The results were checked for accordance with the coding recommendation of the Medical Service of the Health Insurance Funds (MDK) with respect to the co-morbidity T88.4. For all valid cases, the DRG, the diagnosis code and the co-morbidity codes were retrieved from the hospital information system. Subsequently all cases were regrouped with the GetDRG grouper (Fa. GEOS), taking the co-morbidity T88.4 in account. Results: Out of the 21,204 patients, 12,261 were intubated for general anesthesia. A failed or difficult intubation according to the definition of the expert group of social medicine was documented in 276 anesthesia cases (2.3%). In 31 cases the coding of the co-morbidity T88.4 led to an increase in revenue by grouping the case in a different DRG. Using the base rate of the year 2005 (EUR 3,379.66), the surplus in basic points of 17.093 resulted in an additional reimbursement of EUR 57,768.53. Conclusion: With this study it was shown that the consequent coding of the co-morbidity T88.4 during anesthesia can lead to increased reimbursement. A prerequisite is the accurate documentation and coding by the attending anesthetist.",0,0
19950730,Upper lip bite test as a predictor of difficult mask ventilation: a prospective study,"Background: Oxygenation and ventilation by means of bag-mask and ambubag play a significant role in maintaining an optimal oxygen saturation of blood and hence the essence of life itself. Predicting difficulty in mask ventilation is again of paramount importance at the time of induction of anesthesia, and in emergency situations. In this study we aimed at evaluating factors that could help in predicting the difficulty of bag-mask ventilation. Methods: In a prospective study, 200 patients were allocated into two groups, 100 each. First group with a ULBT class I, and the other group with ULBT class II and III. Factors such as height, weight, gender, past history of snoring, neck circumference, Mallampati class, sternomental and thyromental distances were then evaluated in each of the patients in the two groups in order to arrive at their impact on the incidence of difficult mask ventilation. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, student t-test and Fisher's exact tests depending upon the situation. A p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The results revealed that negative predictive value (NPV) of ULBT class, history of snoring and neck circumference were 86%, 83%, 81%, respectively. A combination of these three predictors had an NPV of 95%. Conclusion: ULBT class alone was of value in predicting difficulty in mask ventilation, but a combination of the three tests significantly improved the predictive value.",1,1
23666770,Anatomical reconstructions of pediatric airways from endoscopic images: a pilot study of the accuracy of quantitative endoscopy,"Objectives/hypothesis: To evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) airway reconstructions obtained using quantitative endoscopy (QE). We developed this novel technique to reconstruct precise 3D representations of airway geometries from endoscopic video streams. This method, based on machine vision methodologies, uses a post-processing step of the standard videos obtained during routine laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. We hypothesize that this method is precise and will generate assessment of airway size and shape similar to those obtained using computed tomography (CT). Study design: This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB). We analyzed video sequences from pediatric patients receiving rigid bronchoscopy. Methods: We generated 3D scaled airway models of the subglottis, trachea, and carina using QE. These models were compared to 3D airway models generated from CT. We used the CT data as the gold standard measure of airway size, and used a mixed linear model to estimate the average error in cross-sectional area and effective diameter for QE. Results: The average error in cross sectional area (area sliced perpendicular to the long axis of the airway) was 7.7 mm(2) (variance 33.447 mm(4)). The average error in effective diameter was 0.38775 mm (variance 2.45 mm(2)), approximately 9% error. Conclusion: Our pilot study suggests that QE can be used to generate precise 3D reconstructions of airways. This technique is atraumatic, does not require ionizing radiation, and integrates easily into standard airway assessment protocols. We conjecture that this technology will be useful for staging airway disease and assessing surgical outcomes.",0,0
19216414,Guideline for monitoring and management of pediatric patients during and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures,"The safe sedation of children for procedures requires a systematic approach that includes the following: no administration of sedating medication without the safety net of medical supervision, careful presedation evaluation for underlying medical or surgical conditions that would place the child at increased risk from sedating medications, appropriate fasting for elective procedures and a balance between depth of sedation and risk for those who are unable to fast because of the urgent nature of the procedure, a focused airway examination for large tonsils or anatomic airway abnormalities that might increase the potential for airway obstruction, a clear understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the medications used for sedation as well as an appreciation for drug interactions, appropriate training and skills in airway management to allow rescue of the patient, age- and size-appropriate equipment for airway management and venous access, appropriate medications and reversal agents, sufficient numbers of people to both carry out the procedure and monitor the patient, appropriate physiologic monitoring during and after the procedure, a properly equipped and staffed recovery area, recovery to presedation level of consciousness before discharge from medical supervision, and appropriate discharge instructions.",0,0

We report a case of acromegaly scheduled for transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma under general anesthesia in whom all possible means failed us in the insertion of the endotracheal tube (ET) through the mouth, a procedure essential for transsphenoidal surgery. The operation was called off and for securing his compromised airway a nasal ET was placed under fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Five days later, awake oral fiberoptic intubation was successful under topical anesthesia. We suggest that oral endotracheal intubation performed awake under topical anesthesia with the aid of a fiberoptic bronchoscope is a choice approach in acromegalic patients with predicated difficult airway who are to receive surgery.",0,0

The most recent advances for facilitation of difficult tracheal intubation is the introduction of the video-assisted laryngoscopes. The management of difficult tracheal intubation by video-assisted laryngoscopy can be further facilitated by using suspension laryngoscopy which frees the hands of the anesthesiologist to handle the insertion of the endotracheal tube with the aid of an endotracheal tube introducer, and a curved pipe stylet, under an umbrella of pharyngeal oxygen insufflation.",0,0
6846752,[Preventive measures before a difficult intubation],"Difficult intubations occur frequently. Unfortunately they cannot always be recognized before intubating. This paper describes the most important prophylactical measures which can prevent risks during intubation. These are: examination (morphology, mobilization of the joints, laryngoscopy), optimal positioning of the patient, aspiration prophylaxis, choice and preparation of equipment and drugs, the repeated question of necessity of intubation, the oxygen supply and the attempt to ventilate the patient before giving muscle relaxants.

1489077,[Fiberoptic determination of the position of the laryngeal mask],"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) provides a patent airway when placed 'blindly' into the hypopharynx. At the laryngeal side it is supposed to form a seal surrounding the laryngeal inlet with the epiglottis lying outside the mask aperture. This study is designed to assess the prelaryngeal position of the mask by the fibreoptic technique. METHODS. After approval by the local ethical committee and informed consent, 100 adult patients (ASA groups I and II) undergoing general anaesthesia for extracorporal stroke wave lithotripsy (ESWL, Lithotripter HM 3, Dornier) of the kidney were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5-2.5 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (1-1.5 micrograms.kg-1) and maintained with isoflurane and N2O (65% in O2) as clinically indicated. The LMA was left in situ until the patients opened their mouth on command. Monitoring consisted of an ECG (SMV 104-D, Dornier), a pulse oximeter (Nellcor 200, Draeger), and a non-invasive blood pressure monitor (BP 103 N, Hoyer). Clinical assessment of airway patency and fibreoptic laryngoscopy (BF Typ 10, Olympus)--immediately and 20 min following the insertion of the LMA--were performed by two observers. RESULTS. The insertion of the LMA was successful on the first attempt in 89 patients while 5% required two, 4% three and 2% four attempts. 'Blindly' inserted without neuromuscular blockade the LMA provided a clinically sufficient airway in all patients. A central position of the LMA was assessed in only 59% of the cases. In 4 patients the mask was riding on the vocal folds. Positioned at the posterior larynx the cuff produced a compression of the laryngeal orifice when insufflated. Oblique insertion of the LMA or oblique head position during insertion produced a misplacement of the LMA. In 5 cases the LMA followed lateral movements of the head without losing its central position. In 87% the epiglottis was within the lumen of the LMA. Secretions inside the mask lumen or at the anatomic structures were seen in 36%. During manual ventilation with high inspiratory pressure (> 25 cm H2O) the oesophagus opened in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS. Previous studies have suggested that the LMA takes a 'perfect' position at the laryngeal side when a clinically patent airway is recognized. In contrast, our results demonstrated that a central position of the LMA is achieved in only 59% of the cases. Our results indicate that epiglottic downfolding or left/right side or anterior/posterior misplacement are common but generally provide a satisfactory patent airway. This is consistent with fibreoptic findings in children and radiological observations in adults. The LMA is an essential enrichment to conventional airway management. It provides a better seal than the face mask, especially in bearded or in old patients where the facial contours are often not suited to the mask. Ideal indications seem to be elective operations of intermediate duration (1-2 h). The LMA does not protect against aspiration. For patients who are at risk of regurgitation of gastric contents, use of the LMA is absolutely contraindicated. Relative contraindications are local pathology of the pharynx and situations with low pulmonary compliance and/or high airway resistance (massive obesity, asthma, etc.), especially during controlled ventilation. Further studies are necessary to establish definite indications for the application of the LMA.",0,0
21572078,No evidence for diagnostic value of Mallampati score in patients suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Objective: To analyze whether the Mallampati score is reliable as a simple diagnostic test for predicting obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Data sources: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases. Review methods: Studies were ranked by their relevance and validity in a critical appraisal table. Positive and negative predictive values were obtained or recalculated from the selected articles. Results: Eight relevant articles met the inclusion criteria. Three studies reported predictive values for a Mallampati score of 3 to 4. The prevalence (or prior probability) of OSAS in these 3 studies was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50-67), 76% (95% CI, 72-79), and 82% (95% CI, 80-84), respectively. With a Mallampati score of 1 to 2, the risk of OSAS decreases to 45% (95% CI, 33-58), 74% (95% CI, 70-78), and 81% (95% CI, 77-86), respectively. With a Mallampati score of 3 to 4, the risk of OSAS is 69% (95% CI, 59-80), 82% (95% CI, 74-89), and 82% (95% CI, 79-85), respectively. The differences between the prior and the posterior probabilities are rather small and do not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: There is no evidence to maintain that the Mallampati score is of added value for ruling in or ruling out a diagnosis of OSAS in patients suspected for OSAS.",0,0
7573863,Difficult direct laryngoscopy in patients with cervical spine disease,"Two hundred and fifty three patients were examined before surgery for cervical spine disease. The grade of glottic visibility was determined at direct laryngoscopy, using the classification proposed by Cormack and Lehane. The overall prevalence of difficulty (grades 3 and 4) was 20%. Patients with disease that includes the occipito-atlanto-axial complex have a higher prevalence of difficulty than those with disease below the axis vertebra. Occipito-atlanto-axial disease is associated with poor mandibular protrusion. The best single predictor of difficulty was reduced separation of the posterior elements of the first and second cervical vertebrae on lateral radiographs. The Mallampati examination was the best single predictor on physical examination. The Mallampati may be an indicator of poor cranio-cervical extension. Difficulty was rare in patients with class A mandibular protrusion, and invariable in patients with class C protrusion.",0,0
15168942,[Perioperative management of a patient with alcaptonuria--a case report],"Alcaptonuria is a very rare enzymatic disease with a compromised degradation of the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. As a consequence, homogentisic acid accumulates, most of which is cleared by the kidneys. In time, homogentisic acid forms black pigment, which accumulates throughout the body in connective tissue such as cartilage and joints. Apart from superficial discoloration, the most clinical manifestation of the disease is arthropathy, starting in middle age. From the anaesthesiologist's point of view, there is a severe risk of difficult airway because of an advanced stiffness of the cervical spine and a reduced mouth opening in these patients. Due to deformity and stiffness of the spine, difficulties in spinal and epidural anaesthesia must be reckoned with. A further risk for patients with alcaptonuria is cardiac involvement, which occurs later than degenerative changes of the joints. The accumulated pigment most likely adds to the development of degenerative changes of the valve and coronary artery disease and there is an increased risk of developing aneurysms in atherosclerotic altered vessels. Therefore, at the preoperative visit a thorough clinical cardiovascular examination should be performed. Cardiological advice and an examination should be sought from a specialist. For intubation, fibreoptic procedures should be considered. Anaesthetic management and perioperative monitoring are determined by the results of the cardiological examination and the type and extent of the operation.",0,0

Perforation of the upper aerodigestive system may result in severe airway complications that include pneumothorax, pneumonia, mediastinitis, and retropharyngeal abscess. Despite the relative rare occurrence of esophageal perforation during intubation, this type of injury is associated with the poorest outcome, especially when the diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Our case report presents a healthy 23-year-old female for a thyroidectomy. Postoperatively she developed what appeared to be symptoms of pharyngoesophageal injury, suspected to be related to blunt trauma from laryngoscopy.

18558184,Multidisciplinary pediatric trauma team training using high-fidelity trauma simulation,"Background: Trauma resuscitations require a high level of team performance. This study evaluated the impact of a comprehensive effort to improve trauma care through multidisciplinary education and the use of simulation training to reinforce training and evaluate performance. Methods: For a 1-year period, expanded trauma education including monthly trauma simulation sessions using high-fidelity simulators was implemented. All members of the multidisciplinary trauma resuscitation team participated in education, including simulations. Each simulation session included 2 trauma scenarios that were videotaped for debriefing as well as subsequent analysis of team performance. Scored simulations were divided into early (initial 4 months) and late (final 4 months) for comparison. Results: For the first year of the program, 160 members of our multidisciplinary team participated in the simulation. In the early group, the mean percentage of appropriately completed tasks was 65%, whereas in the late group, this increased to 75% (P < .05). Improvements were also observed in initial assessment, airway management, management of pelvic fractures, and cervical spine care. Conclusions: Training of a multidisciplinary team in the care of pediatric trauma patients can be enhanced and evaluated through the use of high-fidelity simulation. Improvements in team performance using innovative technology can translate into more efficient care with fewer errors.",0,0
25582398,Clinical predictors of effective continuous positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome,"Objectives/hypothesis: To identify standard clinical parameters that may predict the optimal level of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Study design: This is a retrospective study in a tertiary academic medical center that included 129 adult patients (117 males and 12 females) with OSAHS confirmed by diagnostic polysomnography (PSG). Methods: All OSAHS patients underwent successful full-night manual titration to determine the optimal CPAP pressure level for OSAHS treatment. The PSG parameters and completed physical examination, including body mass index, tonsil size grading, modified Mallampati grade (also known as updated Friedman's tongue position [uFTP]), uvular length, neck circumference, waist circumference, hip circumference, thyroid-mental distance, and hyoid-mental distance (HMD) were recorded. Results: When the physical examination variables and OSAHS disease were correlated singly with the optimal CPAP pressure, we found that uFTP, HMD, and apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) were reliable predictors of CPAP pressures (P = .013, P = .002, and P < .001, respectively, by multiple regression). When all important factors were considered in a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, a significant correlation with optimal CPAP pressure was formulated by factoring the uFTP, HMD, and AHI (optimal CPAP pressure = 1.01 uFTP + 0.74 HMD + 0.059 AHI - 1.603). Conclusions: This study distinguished the correlation between uFTP, HMD, and AHI with the optimal CPAP pressure. The structure of the upper airway (especially tongue base obstruction) and disease severity may predict the effective level of CPAP pressure. Level of evidence: 4.",0,0
15071886,[Lockjaw caused by induction of anesthesia in a volunteer bone marrow donor],"A 43-year-old healthy female volunteer donor was scheduled for bone marrow harvesting. In the operating room her mouth opening was ascertained to be 5 cm. Anesthesia was induced with thiamylal 250 mg, fentanyl 0.1 mg and vecuronium 6 mg i.v. Her mouth opening was found reduced to 2 cm that was not improved by additional vecuronium 2 mg. A consulted oral surgeon diagnosed temporomandibular disorder. After she was awakened once with resumed mouth opening, anesthesia was reinduced with a bite block placed and with her jaw held open by the oral surgeon, which brought the same results. Laryngoscopy was performed with the jaw forcefully opened and with cricoid pressure applied and the trachea was intubated. The surgical procedure and anesthesia thereafter were uneventful. Postoperative MRI was coincident with the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder. It was speculated that in the donor patient with preexisted type II temporomandibular disorder, muscle relaxation induced by anesthesia caused the mandibular head fall behind the articular disk and dislocated the disk forwardly ending up in closed lock of temporomandibular joint.",0,0
12041624,Endoscopic survey of post-extubation stridor in children,"Endotracheal intubation is an important airway procedure in the management of neonates and infants. Prolonged intubation may result in severe laryngeal injury which may lead to chronic laryngeal disability. The nature and causes of post-extubation airway obstruction were evaluated with videoendoscopy. From June 1998 to September 2000, detailed videoendoscopic examination of pediatric airway was performed in 30 children who had persistent stridor after endotracheal extubation or failure of elective extubation. Common locations of post-extubation lesion are the posterior glottis and subglottis. Retrospective analysis of the causes of stridor included: (1) isolated intubation laryngotracheitis (n = 19); (2) intubation laryngotracheitis with neuromuscular dysfunction which resulted in tongue drop, laryngotracheal incoordination, saliva pooling over the larynx or poor cough reflex(n = 5); and (3) specific airway problems such as laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis or vocal paralysis(n = 6). We favored the term of ""intubation laryngotracheitis"" instead of ""intubation injury"" or 'intubation trauma"". Although most cases of intubation laryngotracheitis heal, leaving a normal or near-normal larynx, some of them still suffer from airway obstruction after endotracheal extubation. Specific airway problems such as severe laryngomalacia or vocal cords paralysis and neurogenic defects should also be taken into consideration.",0,0
1785711,"[Use of the PVC, a laryngoscope for difficult intubation]","The PCV (Piquet-Crinquette-Vilette) laryngoscope has been designed for use in difficult endotracheal intubation in the adult. Its blade, 170 mm long, is curved, narrow (12 mm internal diameter) and semicircular in cross-section, like a closed C. An 8 mm endotracheal tube can be pushed through this blade. There is a cold light source. The use of this blade requires a teeth protector. The epiglottis will be lifted directly, and the blade will be moved into the vestibule, stopping short of the vocal cords. The endotracheal tube will then be introduced into the laryngoscope blade which guides it in between the cords. Once the tube has been checked to be within the trachea, the laryngoscope is removed by sliding the blade backwards over the tube. The PCV may be introduced into the mouth either on the right, or on the left, or behind the molar teeth, or between two teeth. It can held with the handle horizontal in case of a prominent sternum. The limits of this tool are a mouth opening of less then 20 mm, and some rare predictable difficulties which require an X-ray assessment to determine the best intubation technique to be used. Of 115 patients with a predicted difficult endotracheal intubation, fifty were intubated with the PCV without any failures. Also, twenty-five patients, out of thirty, were successfully intubated with the PCV after an attempt with a MacIntosh blade had failed. Of these five failures, one was never intubated by any technique whatsoever, two were intubated by fibroscopy and two by the ENT surgeon.",0,0
9067050,Laryngeal mask airway in severe cervical ankylosis,"Purpose: We present a case of the successful use of a laryngeal airway (LMA) to ventilate the lungs of a patient with severe ankylosing spondylitis for surgery requiring intense muscular relaxation. The use of an LMA in such circumstances is controversial. Clinical features: The patient was a 61-yr-old man with severe emphysema, a cervical spine fixed in marked anterior flexion, and reduced mouth opening (35 mm). The patient refused an awake tracheal intubation because of a previous distressing experience with a fibreoptic awake nasal intubation and an 11 day SICU stay with controlled ventilation via an endotracheal tube. Attempts at spinal blocks had failed in the past. After administration of thiopentone and succinylcholine a #4 LMA was inserted and the lungs were safely ventilated for a 10 min reduction of a dislocated femoral head. Conclusion: The present view that severe ankylosing spondylitis is a contraindication to the use of an LMA may need revision in view of this and other reports of successful airway management in patients with that disease.",0,0
22348802,Standardizing the diagnosis of inhalation injury using a descriptive score based on mucosal injury criteria,"Introduction: Inhalation injury is an important determinant of outcome in patients with major burns. However the diagnostic criteria remain imprecise, preventing objective comparisons of published data. The aims were to evaluate the utility of an inhalation score based on mucosal injury, while assessing separately the oro-pharyngeal sphere (ENT) and tracheobronchial tree (TB) in patients admitted to the ICU with a suspicion of inhalation injury. Methods: Prospective observational study in 100 patients admitted with suspicion of inhalation injury among 168 consecutive burn admissions to the ICU of a university hospital. Inclusion criteria, endoscopic airway assessment during the first hours. ENT/TB lesion grading was 1: oedema, hyperemia, hypersecretion, 2: bullous mucosal detachment, erosion, exudates, 3: profound ulcers, necrosis. Results: Of the 100 patients (age 42±17 years, burns 23±19%BSA), 79 presented an ENT inhalation injury ≥ENT1 (soot present in 24%): 36 had a tracheobronchial extension, 33 having a grade ≥TB1. Burned vibrissae: 10 patients ""without"" suffered ENT injury, while 6 patients ""with"" had no further lesions. Length of mechanical ventilation was strongly associated with the first 24 hrs' fluid resuscitation volume (p<0.0001) and the presence of inhalation injury (p=0.03), while the ICU length of stay was correlated with the %BSA. Soot was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation (p=0.0115). There was no extubation failure. Conclusions: The developed inhalation score was simple to use, providing a unified language, and drawing attention to upper airway involvement. Burned vibrissae and suspected history proved to be insufficient diagnostic criteria. Further studies are required to validate the score in a larger population.",0,0
20196416,Modified Mallampati test and thyromental distance as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in Thai patients,"Background: Preoperative evaluation of anatomical landmarks and clinical factors are important in the detection of patients at risk for difficult laryngoscopy. The modified Mallampati test (MMT) and thyromental distance (TMD) are commonly used for this purpose but there are controversies regarding their accuracy. Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of MMT and TMD in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in Thai patients. Material and method: 1888 consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were evaluated preoperatively using the MMT and TMD. The cut-off points for the difficult airway predictors were: Mallampati 3, 4 and TMD less than 6 cm. During direct laryngoscopy, the laryngeal view was graded using the Cormack and Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult laryngoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Results: The present study found Mallampati grade I 1050 patients (55.6%), grade II 730 patients (38.7%), grade III 104 patients (5.5%), grade IV 4 pateints (0.2%) and TMD less than 6 cm 85 patients (4.5%), TMD more than 6 cm 1803 patients (95.5%). Difficult laryngoscopy occurred in 60 patients (3.2%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the two airway predictors were: MMT 41.7%, 95.5%, 23.1% and 98.0% and TMD 23.3%, 96.1%, 16.5% and 97.4% respectively. The combination of two predictors with a sensitivity, specificity PPV and NPV were 55.0%, 92.3%, 19.1% and 98.4%. Conclusion: MMT TMD and their combination are good predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in a Thai population.",1,1
22286814,Inter-observer reproducibility of 15 tests used for predicting difficult intubation,"Aim: To determine the inter-observer reproducibility of 15 tests used for predicting difficult tracheal intubation (DI). Material and methods: Following local ethics committee approval and informed consent, 101 volunteers were examined by two assessors using 15 tests for predicting DI. The two assessors who were blinded to the results of the other, examined each volunteer independently. Cohen's kappa (κ) or first-order agreement coefficient (AC1) were used to measure agreement between assessor ratings on a qualitative scale. Agreement between two quantitative outcomes was described using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson's (PCC) or Spearman's (SCC) correlation coefficients. The following interpretation of the coefficients was used: poor (< 0.20), fair (0.21-0.40), satisfactory (0.41-0.60), good (0.61-0.80), and excellent (0.81-1.00). Results: Respective coefficients of inter-rater agreement and correlation coefficients were determined for the following parameters: pathologies associated with DI (κ=0.662, AC1=0.990), clinical impression (κ=-0.013, AC1=0.969), modified Mallampati test (κ=0.503, AC1=0.861), upper lip bite test (κ=0.370, AC1=0.897), temporo-mandibular joint movement (κ=0.088, AC1=0.797), max. anteroflexion of C-spine (ICC=0.136, SCC=0.391), max. retroflexion of C-spine (ICC=0.020, SCC=0.284), mandibular length (ICC=0.301, SCC=0.553), neck circumference (ICC=0.832, SCC=0.928), hyo-mental distance (ICC=0.378, SCC=0.472), thyro-mental distance (ICC=-0.002, PCC=0.265), sternomental distance (ICC=0.674, PCC=0.815), and finally, inter-incisor gap (ICC=0.695, PCC=0.785). Two tests (positive history of DI and retrogenia), were excluded from calculation because no positive cases were found. Conclusion: Best inter-rater agreement was found for the assessment of neck circumference while the highest discrepancies between raters were in goniometrically-measured mobility of the C-spine. Many of the pre-operative airway tests had only fair inter-observer reproducibility. This may be one reason why models for predicting difficult intubation are not universally reliable.",0,0
15058127,An assessment of small simulators used to teach basic airway management,"This study assessed small simulators sold for teaching basic airway management. The assessment used criteria based on guidelines produced by the Australian Resuscitation Council and our experience teaching health professional trainees. Criteria included how well the simulators demonstrated manoeuvres to open the airway, mouth-to-mouth and mask-to-mouth expired air resuscitation and artificial ventilation using a bag and mask. Simulators with permanently open airways (as is the case with some intubation manikins) were not tested. Each simulator was also assessed for realism in relation to look and feel, hygiene and sturdiness of construction. Clinical staff and medical students who teach basic airway management undertook a standardized assessment of nine simulators. There were significant differences between simulators that could impact on learning. Generally, models with hard surfaces tended to be less realistic in both look and feel compared to those with flexible ""skin"". Realism of lung inflation and its relationship to airway opening manoeuvres varied greatly between simulators. The Little Anne small simulator functioned most realistically in our tests.",0,0
21490818,The relationship between the predictors of obstructive sleep apnea and difficult intubation,"Background: The study was performed in order to determine the risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients. Methods: For 115 male patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and who were undergoing palatal muscle resection (PMR), we investigated the correlation between their age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), their Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), their neck circumference and the difficulty of tracheal intubation. Results: The factors significantly related to difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients were a high AHI and a large neck circumference. There was no significant correlation between weight, BMI, arterial hypertension, ESS and difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients. Conclusions: In this study, a high AHI and a large neck circumference can predict difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients.",0,0
9102581,[Anesthesiologic problems in patients with Launois-Bensaude-Madelung disease. Clinical case],"Authors report a Launoise-Bensaude-Madelung disease case, in a 64 year old man, admitted to a Plastic Surgical Department for obesity, dysphonia, dysphagia, dyspnea. Early symptoms appeared 20 years before Hospital admission. Lipomatous tissue occupied nape, mandible, neck and shoulders. Surgical exeresis of lipomatous tissue under general anesthesia needed for the patient. Neck movements and mouth opening were short (Mallampati Score = 4); a neck computed tomography showed a tracheal compression and right displacement. Tracheal intubation was considered difficult or impossible. Nose-tracheal intubation was performed using a pediatric fiberoptic instrument as guide for a small gauge tracheal tube. Tracheal stenosis required many attempts for correct nose-tracheal intubation. Fiberoptic instrument as guide for tracheal tube can be useful for patients with Launoise-Bensaude-Madelung disease, when tracheal intubation is considered difficult or impossible. Knowledge of fiberoptic tracheal intubation techniques is mandatory for anesthesiologists, allowing tracheal intubation in patients with anatomical variations of mouth or upper respiratory airways.",0,0
25429746,Evaluation of risk factors for arytenoid dislocation after endotracheal intubation: a retrospective case-control study,"Objective: To investigate the risk factors for postoperative arytenoid dislocation. Methods: From September 2003 to August 2013, the records of 16 patients with a history of postoperative arytenoid dislocation were reviewed. Patients matched in terms of date and type of procedures were chosen as the controls (n=16). Recorded data for all patients were demographics, smoking status, alcoholic status, preoperative physical status, airway evaluation, intubation procedures, preoperative laboratory test results, anesthetic consumption and intensive care unit stay. For arytenoid dislocation cases, we further analyzed the incidences of the left and right arytenoid dislocation, and the outcomes of surgical repair and conservative treatment. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, and were compared using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables were expressed as means±SD and compared using the Student's unpaired t-test. To determine the predictors of arytenoid dislocation, a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Sixteen patients with postoperative arytenoid dislocation were enrolled, with a median age of 52 years. Most postoperative arytenoid dislocation patients (15/16, 93.75%) received surgical repair, except one patient who recovered after conservative treatment. None of the postoperative arytenoid dislocation patients were smokers. Red blood cell (P=0.044) and hemoglobin (P=0.031) levels were significantly lower among arytenoid dislocation cases compared with the controls. Conclusions: Non-smoking and anemic patients may be susceptible to postoperative arytenoid dislocation. However, neither of them was independent risk factor for postoperative arytenoid dislocation.",0,0
25868969,Airway management in patients with burn contractures of the neck,"Airway management of patients with burn contracture of the neck (PBC neck) is a challenge to the anesthesiologist. Patient evaluation includes history, physical and airway examination. A safe approach in the airway management of a patient with moderate to severe PBC neck is to secure the airway with the patient awake. The anesthesiologist should have a pre-planned strategy for intubation of the difficult airway. The choices advocated for airway management of such patients include awake fiberoptic-guided intubation, use of intubating laryngeal mask airway, intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents, intubation with neuromuscular blocking agents after testing the ability to ventilate by mask, pre-induction neck scar release under local anesthesia and ketamine or sedation followed by direct laryngoscopy and intubation and video-laryngoscope guided intubation, amongst others. Preparation of the patient includes an explanation of the proposed procedure, sedation, administration of antisialogogues and regional anesthesia of the airway. The various options for intubation of patients with PBC neck, intraoperative concerns and safe extubation are described. Back-up plans, airway rescue strategies and a review of literature on this subject are presented.",0,0
21206744,Mallampati class is not useful in the clinical assessment of sleep clinic patients,"Study objectives: To assess the utility of Mallampati class, a simple grade of oropharyngeal appearance used to assess difficulty of intubation, to predict severe obstructive sleep apnea and absence of OSA (rule in severe OSA and rule out OSA). Method: Retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic polysomnography in a tertiary referral sleep disorders center. Modified Mallampati class and other simple patient characteristics (age, gender, body mass index) were compared to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated for Mallampati class IV to detect an AHI > 30 (rule in severe OSA) and Mallampati class I to detect an AHI < 5 (rule out OSA). Results: A total of 953 consecutive patients (619 male) undergoing diagnostic polysomnography were included. The age of the cohort was 50.0 ± 6.4 years, with a BMI of 33.8 ± 8.6 kg/m² and AHI of 26.1 ± 25.1 /h (95% CI 1.4-78.8). Mallampati class was significantly associated with AHI (r = 0.13, p < 0.001), but there were no differences in AHI between Mallampati classes. A Mallampati class IV had a sensitivity of 40%, specificity of 67%, LR+ of 1.21, and LR- of 0.90 for an AHI > 30. A Mallampati class I was only 13% sensitive but 92% specific for an AHI < 5, with LR+ of 1.63 and LR- 0.90. Conclusions: Mallampati class is associated with AHI but does not significantly modify likelihood of severe OSA or absence of OSA. As such, it is of limited use to ""rule in"" severe OSA or ""rule out OSA"" in the sleep clinic population.",0,0
24215652,Straight video blades are advantageous than curved blades in simulated pediatric difficult intubation,"Background: It is still controversial which laryngoscope may be a better option in unanticipated difficult airway in pediatric patients. The aim of the present study was to compare two direct and two video-assisted laryngoscope devices for the management of difficult pediatric airway. Methods: Forty-five anesthesiology residents and nurse anesthetists participated in the study. Macintosh, Miller, Storz Miller, and McGrath Mac curved laryngoscopes were used for tracheal intubation of 3-6-month Airsim Pierre Robin manikin. We compared the duration of successful intubation, number of attempts, glottic view grades, severity of dental trauma, the use of optimization maneuvers, and the difficulty of use of the devices with straight and curved laryngoscope blades. Results: Successful intubation duration was significantly lower in Storz Miller device, and the number of intubation attempts was significantly higher in the Macintosh laryngoscope (P < 0.01). According to the Cormack and Lehane classification, Grades 1 and 2 glottic view was 20% for Macintosh and 40% for Miller laryngoscope, while it was 100% for Storz Miller and 80% for McGrath (P < 0.001). Difficulty VAS scores of Storz Miller device were significantly lower than the scores of Macintosh, Miller, and McGrath laryngoscopes (15.7 ± 14.89, 34.7 ± 26.44, 31.5 ± 26.74, 33.4 ± 26.67 mm, respectively; P < 0.01). The severity of dental trauma was significantly lower in Storz Miller compared with Macintosh, Miller, and McGrath laryngoscopes (0.96 ± 1.04, 1.67 ± 1.15, 1.38 ± 1.05, 1.42 ± 1.27, respectively; P < 0.01). Conclusion: Storz Miller laryngoscope was found to have advantages over the other laryngoscopes in regard to glottic view, duration of successful intubation, number of attempts, dental trauma severity, need for additional maneuvers, and ease of use.",0,0
14570789,Randomized comparison of the classic Laryngeal Mask Airway with the Airway Management Device during anaesthesia,"Background: We compared the modified Airway Management Device (AMD) with the classic Laryngeal Mask Airway (cLMA) in a randomized comparative trial. Methods: Primary outcome was success of airway placement. Secondary outcomes included time to achieve an airway, airway manipulations required, complications during use and fibre-optic assessment of airway positioning. Results: We planned to study 300 patients but interim analysis demonstrated the study should be stopped after 100 patients. The AMD was inserted on the first attempt less frequently than the cLMA (P=0.04). Eight AMDs and one cLMA could not be placed within three attempts (P=0.03). The AMD required more attempts (P=0.03) and more manipulations (P=0.02) and caused more complications (P=0.01) during insertion. During maintenance of anaesthesia, three AMDs and no cLMAs had to be removed as a result of complications. Seal pressure was better with the AMD than with the cLMA (AMD 25 cm H2O, cLMA 20 cm H2O, P=0.001). Efficacy of ventilation was better with the cLMA than with the AMD (P=0.005). On fibre-optic examination, positioning over the larynx was better with the cLMA than with the AMD (P=0.005). Two of 32 attempts to pass an orogastric tube via the AMD were successful. During recovery, two AMDs and no cLMAs required premature removal. Tolerance during emergence, the incidence of blood on the devices and the incidence of postoperative complications were equivalent between devices. Overall failure rate of the AMD was greater than that of the cLMA (P=0.001). Conclusions: Successful insertion of the cLMA is more likely than that of the AMD. Insertion of the AMD required more attempts and caused a greater number of complications. Fibre-optic position was poorer than with the cLMA. When an airway is established, the AMD caused a greater number of complications during anaesthesia and failed more frequently than the cLMA. During recovery from anaesthesia, more complications occurred with the AMD. Overall performance of the AMD was poorer than with the classic LMA.",0,0
20337000,[Use of a rigid laryngoscope and a flexible nasal fiberoptic scope to assess the difficult airway: description of 3 cases],"Indirect inspection of the airway using a 70 degrees rigid laryngoscope plus a flexible nasal fiberoptic scope can provide additional information when the anesthesiologist foresees that airway management will be difficult. These devices are useful for detecting structural abnormalities, they can be attached to the same visualization system, and they do not require topical anesthesia or sedation of the patient. We report on 3 patients diagnosed with difficult airway. Inspection with a rigid laryngoscope during the preanesthetic assessment visit revealed abnormalities that prevented visualization of the glottis. In the first case, the epiglottis was absent, as it had been removed with a surrounding tumor; in the second and third cases, an epiglottic deformity and hypertrophy of the base of the tongue were found. A flexible nasal fiberoptic scope gave an unobstructed view of the glottis in these cases, making it easier to choose an intubation method.",0,0
26280546,Tongue Volume Influences Lowest Oxygen Saturation but Not Apnea-Hypopnea Index in Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify correlations between sleep apnea severity and tongue volume or posterior airway space measured via three-dimensional reconstruction of volumetric computerized tomography (CT) images in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for use in predicting OSA severity and in surgical treatment. We also assessed associations between tongue volume and Mallampati score. Methods: Snoring/OSA male patients (n = 64) who underwent polysomnography, cephalometry, and CT scans were enrolled in this retrospective study. OSA was diagnosed when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was greater than 5 (mild 5-14; moderate 15-29; severe>30). The patients were also categorized into the normal-mild group (n = 22) and the moderate-severe group (n = 42). Using volumetric CT images with the three-dimensional reconstruction technique, the volume of the tongue, posterior airway space volume, and intra-mandibular space were measured. The volumes, polysomnographic parameters, and physical examination findings were compared, and independent factors that are related to OSA were analysed. Results: No associations between tongue volume or posterior airway space and the AHI were observed. However, multivariate linear analyses showed that tongue volume had significantly negative association with lowest O2 saturation (r = 0.365, p = 0.027). High BMI was related to an increase in tongue volume. Modified Mallampati scores showed borderline significant positive correlations with absolute tongue volume (r = 0.251, p = 0.046) and standardized tongue volume (absolute tongue volume / intramandibular area; r = 0.266, p = 0.034). Between the normal-mild and moderate-severe groups, absolute tongue volumes were not different, although the standardized tongue volume in the moderate-severe group was significantly higher. Conclusion: Absolute tongue volume showed stronger associations with lowest O2 saturation during sleep than with the severity of AHI. We also found that high BMI was a relevant factor for an increase in absolute tongue volume and modified Mallampati grading was a useful physical examination to predict tongue size.",0,0
21602973,Comparison of the ease of laryngeal mask airway ProSeal insertion and the fiberoptic scoring according to the head position and the presence of a difficult airway,"Background: The sniffing position is recommended for conventional laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion. However, there has been a high success rate of LMA insertion with the head in the neutral position. The effect of a difficult airway on the ease of LMA insertion is not clear. In this study, we compared the ease of LMA ProSeal™ (PLMA) insertion and the fiberoptic scoring according to the head position and the presence of a difficult airway. Methods: After obtaining informed consent from the subjects, we enrolled 144 adult patients (age range: 18-65) with an ASA physical status 1 or 2. After evaluation of the airway, all the patients were grouped into the EA (easy airway) group (n = 68) and the DA (difficult airway) group (n = 76). According to the head position, each group was divided into the EA-SE (extension) group (n = 35), the EA-SN (sniffing) group (n = 33), the DA-SE group (n = 39) and the DA-SN group (n = 37). The success rate and insertion time at the first attempt were evaluated. The position of the PLMA was fiberoptically scored from the mask aperture of the airway tube in the original head position. After the head position was changed to the sniffing and neutral positions in the SE and SN group, respectively, the position of PLMA was re-evaluated fiberoptically. Results: The success rate and insertion time at the first attempt and the fiberoptic score showed no significant difference among the groups. After head position was changed, there were no significant changes in the fiberopitc scores. Conclusions: A difficult airway and the head position had no influence on the ease of PLMA insertion and the fiberopic score. Therefore, the head position can be selected according to the individual patient's situation.",0,0
23683449,Use of simple clinical predictors on preoperative diagnosis of difficult endotracheal intubation in obese patients,"Background and objectives: Although the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy is similar in obese and non-obese patients, there are more reports of difficult intubation in obese individuals. Alternatives for the diagnosis and prediction of difficult intubation in the preoperative period may help reduce anesthetic complications in obese patients. The aim of this study was to identify predictors for the diagnosis of difficult airway in obese patients, correlating with the clinical methods of pre-anesthetic evaluation and polysomnography. We also compared the incidence of difficult facemask ventilation and difficult laryngoscopy between obese and non-obese patients, identifying the most prevalent predictors. Methods: Observational, prospective and comparative study, with 88 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. In the preoperative period, we evaluated a questionnaire on the clinical predictors of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and anatomical parameters. During anesthesia, we evaluated difficult facemask ventilation and laryngoscopy. Descriptive statistics and correlation test were used for analysis. Results: Patients were allocated into two groups: obese group (n=43) and non-obese group (n=45). Physical status, prevalence of snoring, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, neck circumference, and Mallampati index were higher in the obese group. Obese patients had a higher incidence of difficult facemask ventilation and laryngoscopy. There was no correlation between anatomical or clinical variable and difficult facemask ventilation in both groups. In obese patients, the diagnosis of OSAS showed strong correlation with difficult laryngoscopy. Conclusions: The clinical and polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA proved useful in the preoperative diagnosis of difficult laryngoscopy. Obese patients are more prone to difficult facemask ventilation and laryngoscopy.",0,0
10989859,Variations in ILMA external diameters: another cause of device failure,"Purpose: To report failure of insertion of #5 and #4 intubating laryngeal mask airways (ILMAs) in a patient with a mouth opening of just under 25 mm, and the variances among same-size ILMAs. Clinical features: A 53-yr-old man with obstructive sleep apnea underwent elective ENT surgical repair. His mouth opening was just under 25 mm. Ventilation by mask was easy. Direct laryngoscopy failed after induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular block. Neither a #5 nor a #4 ILMA could be passed between the patient's teeth, despite different twisting maneuvres. A #4 LMA was thus prepared as a conduit for fibreoptic intubation. Placement of the LMA was easy, as was fibreoptic-guided intubation. The LMA was removed over the tracheal tube (TT) to enable ENT surgery, and the further course was uneventful. Manual examination showed that, unlike others of the same type, the failed ILMAs were not sufficiently compressible either to allow insertion in this patient or to the 20 mm reported as the maximal outer dimension of the device. Radiological examination revealed that, at the point of the device where it is intended to be compressible, the silicone layer was thicker in the failed devices than in stock compressible ILMAs, and the end of the steel tube was not so sharply beveled. Conclusion: Our inability to insert an ILMA in a patient with an interdental distance of just under 25 mm was because the device was not sufficiently compressible although the manufacturer states the maximal outer dimension to be 20 mm.",0,0
27366492,Comparison of the Macintosh and Airtraq Laryngoscopes in Endotracheal Intubation Success,"Objective: Endotracheal intubation of patients is an effective method for controlling airway and breathing. However, laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation is not easy in every case. There is a recent abundance of equipment used for controlling ventilation and intubation. Airtraq is one of those equipments. In this study, our main objective is to compare the success rates of the Airtraq and Macintosh (direct and classic) laryngoscopes in endotracheal intubation. Methods: In this single-center, prospective, randomized, clinical study was performed on 80 patients who were operated under general anesthesia, ASA I-II, 18-65 years old. Patients were intubated using two different endotracheal intubation tools. Group A was intubated using the Macintosh (direct and classic) laryngoscope, meanwhile Group B was intubated using the Airtraq laryngoscope. Patients' snoring complaints, modified Mallampati scores, sternomental distances, thyromental distances, interincisor distance measurements and Cormack-Lehane (C-L) laryngoscopic classification, upper lip bite test results, intubation time, number of intubation attempts, maneuvers and techniques used for facilitating intubation and complications arising from intubation were recorded. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of C-L scores (p=0.041). In all, 8 patients in the Macintosh group, and 2 patients in the Airtraq group were C-L grade III. In intubation of the Airtraq group, only 3 patients required facilitating techniques, meanwhile in intubation of the Macintosh group 15 patients we had to use one or more facilitating maneuver. The rate of Mallampati scoring ""difficult"" was 4/6 in the Macintosh and 2/11 in Airtraq laryngoscopy groups (p=0.553). Conclusion: In cases with seemingly difficult intubations, we believe the Airtraq laryngoscope has an advantage over the Macintosh laryngoscope, owing to its better view of the oropharyngeal and glottic areas in addition to facilitating intubation in patients with limited head extension.",0,0
1862892,Intubation through the laryngeal mask. A technique for unexpected difficult intubation,"Unexpected difficulty with tracheal intubation contributes to anaesthetic mortality. The laryngeal mask can almost always be placed satisfactorily and its position should facilitate blind intubation. A 6-mm cuffed tube will pass through both adult sizes of the mask and this study tested the feasibility of intubation through the mask. The effect of the application of cricoid pressure on the technique was also investigated. Intubation via the laryngeal mask was attempted in 100 routine patients: of the first 50 (group 1, no cricoid pressure), 45 (90%) were successfully intubated. Maintenance of cricoid pressure throughout the manoeuvre (group 2) reduced the success rate significantly to 56% (p less than 0.05). Despite the possibility that cricoid pressure may have to be interrupted momentarily, the ease with which the technique can be learnt, and the immediate availability of the necessary apparatus suggest that it should be considered for inclusion in failed intubation drill.",0,0
26903674,Current practice of difficult airway management: A survey,"Background and aims: Difficult airway (DA) management depends on both training and actual usage of the various approaches in the event of difficulty. The aim of the study was to assess how well the anaesthesiologists are equipped to deal with DA situations. The current practice preference of DA management was also assessed. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed in a continuing medical education (CME) programme dedicated to DA and responses were noted and analysed, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18. Results: The response rate was 73%. Airway assessment was performed by majority. Sixty eight percent consultants and 47% residents were well aware of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' DA algorithm. 67% consultants and 65% residents attended at least one CME on DA in the previous 5 years. There was an overall deficiency of video laryngoscopes, retrograde intubation and cricothyrotomy sets. Most of the respondents were comfortable in using supraglottic airway devices (SGADs). In anticipated DA, the preferred choice of management for junior doctors was attempting conventional method once and awake fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) for the experienced. In unanticipated DA, most of the residents and consultants opted for SGAD. Extubation strategy was similar for both. Thirty four percent of respondents experienced a 'cannot intubate-cannot ventilate' situation at least once. Conclusion: Our survey showed that most respondents performed routine pre-operative airway assessment. A good armamentarium of airway gadgets should be made available in hospitals. Further training in techniques like video laryngoscopy, FOB or cricothyrotomy are essential.",0,0
19697822,[Rocuronium vs atracurium vs suxamethonium for double-lumen endobronchial tube intubation],"Background: Intubation with a double lumen tube requires excellent and stable relaxation, necessary for accurate positioning of the device using a fibre optic scope. Methods: We have compared conditions for endobronchial intubation after administration of 1 mg kg(-1) rocuronium (group E), 0.1 mg kg(-1) cis-atracurium (group N) and 1.5 mg kg(-1) suxamethonium (group P) in 70 randomly allocated adult patients, scheduled for elective lung surgery. Conditions for intubation were assessed using Mallampati, Cromack-Lehan and Krieg scores. Results: The duration and conditions for intubation, and the onset of relaxation were comparable in all groups. Patients paralysed with suxamethonium required more frequent repositioning of double lumen tubes, compared to those paralysed with rocuronium and cis-atracurium. Discussion: Although all drugs given in equipotent doses proved to be suitable for the planned procedure, we conclude that suxamethonium could easily be abandoned in routine anaesthesia for elective lung surgery.",0,0
25900232,What Factors Influence Community Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons' Choice to Use Capnography in the Office-Based Ambulatory Anesthesia Setting?,"Purpose: The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons Board of Trustees mandated monitoring using capnography during moderate sedation (MS) and deep sedation or general anesthesia (DS/GA) delivered in the office setting effective January 1, 2014. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of capnography use and to identify variables associated with a clinician's choice to use capnography before the mandate. Materials and methods: To address the research purpose, the authors designed a prospective cohort study and enrolled 2 samples: 1) American private practicing oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) and 2) all eligible patients for whom these OMSs delivered MS or DS/GA. The predictor variables were categorized as surgeon or patient demographics, anesthesia risk factors, procedure-related variables, and anesthetic medications. The outcome variable was capnography use during MS or DS/GA. Descriptive, bivariate, and forward stepwise multiple logistic regression statistics were computed to evaluate the association between the predictor variables and capnography use, with statistical significance set at a P value less than or equal to .05. Results: The surgeon sample was composed of 95 OMSs and 13.7% reported using capnography. The patient sample included 3,495 patients with a mean age of 30.6 years (standard deviation, 17.8 yr), 43.5% were men, and 5.6% were monitored using capnography. Based on bivariate analyses, 17 variables were associated with capnography use. Forward stepwise regression modeling identified 9 variables statistically associated with capnography use. These variables were patient's age, Mallampati airway score, alcohol consumption, board certification, sevoflurane use, number of monitoring methods, electrocardiogram use, precordial stethoscope use, and number of personnel in operating suite. Conclusions: Although this study might be of historical interest at this time, the results offer insight into OMSs' practice patterns before the mandatory requirement to use capnography. As more OMSs comply with the capnography mandate, their practice patterns involving variables found to statistically correlate with capnography use might become more similar to those of early adopters of this technology.",0,0
16564296,Tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica: cause of difficult tracheal intubation,"Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica is a rare benign disorder affecting the trachea and the bronchi. We report a case presenting as difficulty during tracheal intubation. Chest roentgenogram revealed nothing before surgery. Findings on computed tomographic imaging scans show calcified nodular densities protruding into the tracheal lumen, with an abnormally irregular tracheal morphology and decreased lateral diameter. The fiber optic bronchoscopy, which was unable to pass more than 4 to 5 cm, showed enormous prominent protrusion with significant narrowing of the tracheal lumen. The diagnosis was confirmed by virtual bronchoscopy, which showed a tracheal narrowing with a beaded appearance and an irregular border that extended into the trachea and main bronchi.",0,0
11861352,Submucous fibrosis secondary to chewing of quids: another cause of unanticipated difficult intubation,"Purpose: To report a case of unusual difficult intubation secondary to oral submucosal fibrosis (SMF) associated with malignancy of the hypopharynx. Clinical features: A 57-yr-old male, ASA-I physical status presented for percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. The patient was a known alcoholic and smoker with a habit of chewing quids for the past 36 years. Airway assessment revealed oral SMF and slight difficulty in opening the mouth fully. Mentohyoid and mentothyroid distances were normal. However, during intubation, unanticipated difficulty was encountered. On direct laryngoscopy, the tip of the epiglottis could barely be visualized. Intubation was possible after passing a gum elastic bougie blindly under the epiglottis and negotiating a 7.0 internal diameter tracheal tube over it. Postoperatively, indirect laryngoscopy (IDL) showed severe SMF involving the oral cavity, epiglottis and pyriform fossae and an ulcerative malignancy of the hypopharynx with fixation of the left hemilarynx. Conclusion: SMF is a premalignant condition of the oral cavity associated with fibrosis of involved structures that can be associated with malignancy of the aerodigestive tract. Distortion of the airway anatomy may render intubation difficult. IDL maybe useful in the preoperative evaluation of these patients.",0,0
16428573,"An evaluation of the insertion and function of a new supraglottic airway device, the King LT, during spontaneous ventilation","Trials of the King LT trade mark (LT, King Systems, Noblesville, IN) in controlled ventilation of the lungs have shown that it is an effective supraglottic airway device. We designed this study to evaluate the King LT regarding ease of insertion, position within the airway, and anatomic sealing properties during spontaneous ventilation in 50 ASA physical status I-III, Mallampati I-III, adult patients undergoing routine general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with up to 2 microg/kg fentanyl and 1.5-2 mg/kg propofol and maintained with 70% N2O/30%O2 and isoflurane. Insertion time, oropharyngeal leak pressures, fiberoptic position, and spirometry and hemodynamic data were recorded. Any complications were noted. Insertion was determined to be easy and a patent airway was achieved in all patients. First, second, and third attempt insertion rates were 86%, 12%, and 2%, respectively. Time to place the King LT trade mark was <5 s in 90% of cases. Baseline leak pressures were 31 +/- 8.8 cm H2O (17-50 cm H2O). Complications included laryngospasm (1) and coughing (3) on extubation. The incidence of sore throat at 1 h and 24 h postoperatively was 22% and 15%, respectively. The King LT trade mark is a simple and reliable supraglottic airway device for airway management during spontaneous ventilation.",0,0
26206397,Changes in difficult airway predictors following mandibular setback surgery,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of surgical mandibular backward movements on the predictors of a difficult airway. Thirty-seven skeletal class III patients were included in this study. The Mallampati score, body mass index (BMI), maximal inter-incisal distance, and thyromental and sternomental distances of these patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 6 months and 2 years postoperatively. A sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) without genioplasty was performed in all patients by the same surgical team, and anaesthesia was provided by the same anaesthesiologist using nasotracheal intubation. The paired samples t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for statistical comparisons of the data. There were no statistically significant changes in BMI or sternomental and thyromental distances after SSRO. The maximal inter-incisal distance was significantly reduced at 6 months postoperatively (P<0.05), but no statistical difference was found between the values obtained preoperatively and at 2 years postoperative. A statistically significant increase in Mallampati score was observed postoperatively (P<0.05). Both the patient and practitioner should be aware of the risks associated with an increased postoperative Mallampati score in mandibular setback patients. The amount of mandibular setback in skeletal class III patients with a high preoperative Mallampati score should be limited to prevent potential postoperative airway problems.",0,0
10172477,How should an unconscious person with a suspected neck injury be positioned?,"Introduction: Awareness of the risk of spinal-cord damage in moving an unconscious person with a suspected neck injury into the ""lateral recovery position,"" coupled with the even greater risk of inadequate airway management if the person is not moved, has resulted in a suggested modification to the lateral recovery position for use in this circumstance. Hypothesis: It is proposed that the modification to the lateral recovery position reduces movement of the neck. In this modification, one of the patient's arms is raised above the head (in full abduction) to support the head and neck. The position is called the ""HAINES modified recovery position."" HAINES is an acronym for High Arm IN Endangered Spine. Methods: Neck movements in two healthy volunteers were measured by the use of video-image analysis and radiographic studies when the volunteers were rolled from the supine position to both the lateral recovery position and the HAINES modified recovery position. Results: For both subjects, the total degree of lateral flexion of the cervical spine in the HAINES modified recovery position was less than half of that measured during use of the lateral recovery position (while an open airway was maintained in each). Conclusion: An unconscious person with a suspected neck injury should be positioned in the HAINES modified recovery position. There is less neck movement (and less degree of lateral angulation) than when the lateral recovery position is used, and, therefore, HAINES use carries less risk of spinal-cord damage.",0,0
24871114,[Validity of airway predictors in outpatient medicine],"Isolation of the airway sometimes determines the survival or death of the patient. To anticipate the presence of a difficult airway (DA) there are a number of indicators that are validated for hospitals: Mallampati, sternum and thyromental distance, interdental distance and Cormack grade. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of these indicators in the ambulatory setting and to know the incidence of DA. This data was collected from 324 intubations. Most patients were males (65.2%). The average age of the population was 63 years and no significant difference in age between DA and DA was found. A DA presence of 20.7% was objectified and an alternative device utilization of 21.4%. The thyromental distance was abnormal in 59% of patients and sternomentonal distance in 56.4% but neither showed an association with the presence of DA (p = 0.681 and p = 0.415 respectively). Interdental distance was less than 3 cm if presence is associated with DA (p = 0.005). The sensitivity and specificity of all measures are low. According to our series the sternum and thyromental distance are not useful in the ambulatory setting, but interdental distance is useful for predicting a DA.",0,0
16246268,Purification of full-length human pregnane and xenobiotic receptor: polyclonal antibody preparation for immunological characterization,"Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR; or Steroid and Xenobiotic Receptor, SXR), a new member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is thought to modulate a network of genes that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism and elimination. To further explore the role of PXR in body's homeostatic mechanisms, we for the first time, report successful prokaryotic expression and purification of full-length PXR and preparation of polyclonal antibody against the whole protein. The full-length cDNA encoding a 434 amino acids protein was sub-cloned into prokaryotic expression vector, pET-30b and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for efficient over expression. The inclusion body fraction, containing the expressed recombinant protein, was purified first by solubilizing in sarcosine extraction buffer and then by affinity column chromatography using Ni-NTA His-Bind matrix. The efficacy of anti-PXR antibody was confirmed by immunocytology, Western blot analysis, EMSA and immunohistochemistry. The antibody obtained was capable of detecting human and mouse PXR with high specificity and sensitivity. Immunofluorescence staining of COS-1 cells transfected with human or mouse PXR showed a clear nuclear localization. Results from immunohistochemistry showed that level of PXR in liver sections is immunologically detectable in the nuclei. Similar to exogenously transfected PXR, Western blot analysis of cell extract from HepG2 and COLO320DM cells revealed a major protein band for endogenous PXR having the expected molecular weight of 50 kDa. Relevance of other immunodetectable bands with reference to PXR isoforms and current testimony are evaluated. Advantages of antibody raised against full-length PXR protein for functional characterization of receptor is discussed and its application for clinical purposes is envisaged.",0,0
25935297,Evaluation of heavy metals in hazardous automobile shredder residue thermal residue and immobilization with novel nano-size calcium dispersed reagent,"This study was conducted to synthesize and apply a nano-size calcium dispersed reagent as an immobilization material for heavy metal-contaminated automobile shredder residues (ASR) dust/thermal residues in dry condition. Simple mixing with a nanometallic Ca/CaO/PO4 dispersion mixture immobilized 95-100% of heavy metals in ASR dust/thermal residues (including bottom ash, cavity ash, boiler and bag filter ash). The quantity of heavy metals leached from thermal residues after treatment by nanometallic Ca/CaO/PO4 was lower than the Korean standard regulatory limit for hazardous waste landfills. The morphology and elemental composition of the nanometallic Ca/CaO-treated ASR residue were characterized by field emission scanning election microscopy combined with electron dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS). The results indicated that the amounts of heavy metals detectable on the ASR thermal residue surface decreased and the Ca/PO4 mass percent increased. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis indicated that the main fraction of enclosed/bound materials on ASR residue included Ca/PO4- associated crystalline complexes, and that immobile Ca/PO4 salts remarkably inhibited the desorption of heavy metals from ASR residues. These results support the potential use of nanometallic Ca/CaO/PO4 as a simple, suitable and highly efficient material for the gentle immobilization of heavy metals in hazardous ASR thermal residue in dry condition.",0,0

26790624,Teaching basic lung isolation skills on human anatomy simulator: attainment and retention of lung isolation skills,"Background: Lung isolation skills, such as correct insertion of double lumen endobronchial tube and bronchial blocker, are essential in anesthesia training; however, how to teach novices these skills is underexplored. Our aims were to determine (1) if novices can be trained to a basic proficiency level of lung isolation skills, (2) whether video-didactic and simulation-based trainings are comparable in teaching lung isolation basic skills, and (3) whether novice learners' lung isolation skills decay over time without practice. Methods: First, five board certified anesthesiologist with experience of more than 100 successful lung isolations were tested on Human Airway Anatomy Simulator (HAAS) to establish Expert proficiency skill level. Thirty senior medical students, who were naive to bronchoscopy and lung isolation techniques (Novice) were randomized to video-didactic and simulation-based trainings to learn lung isolation skills. Before and after training, Novices' performances were scored for correct placement using pass/fail scoring and a 5-point Global Rating Scale (GRS); and time of insertion was recorded. Fourteen novices were retested 2 months later to assess skill decay. Results: Experts' and novices' double lumen endobronchial tube and bronchial blocker passing rates showed similar success rates after training (P >0.99). There were no differences between the video-didactic and simulation-based methods. Novices' time of insertion decayed within 2 months without practice. Conclusion: Novices could be trained to basic skill proficiency level of lung isolation. Video-didactic and simulation-based methods we utilized were found equally successful in training novices for lung isolation skills. Acquired skills partially decayed without practice.",0,0
8093140,Excursions of the cervical spine during tracheal intubation: blind oral intubation compared with direct laryngoscopy,"The most appropriate technique for performing tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine injury is debatable. Recently, a new device enabling blind oral intubation (Augustine Guide) with the patient's head and neck in the neutral position has been introduced. The aim of this study was to compare the extent of upper cervical spine movement during intubation with this device compared to direct laryngoscopy. Twelve patients (Mallampati I and II), without a cervical spine injury, were intubated using the Augustine Guide and afterwards by direct laryngoscopy. Both procedures were viewed radiographically. Extension in the upper cervical spine was determined at the point of the maximum excursion. By evaluating the joints occiput-C3 together as a functional unit, blind oral intubation caused 17 degrees (median) less extension compared to direct laryngoscopy (p < 0.01). The median differences observed for the individual joints were: 7 degrees in occiput-C1 (p < 0.05), 5 degrees in C1-2 (p < 0.01) and 6 degrees in C2-3 (p < 0.01) respectively. Since we assume that intubation-induced excursions of the injured spine are even higher, blind oral intubation might be a safe alternative for airway management in this special group of trauma victims.",0,0
9203882,The use of paraglossal straight blade laryngoscopy in difficult tracheal intubation,"In 10 cases of unexpected difficult tracheal intubation using the Macintosh laryngoscope blade, the larynx could not be seen. In each case, a good view was achieved using the Miller blade lateral to the tongue, which enabled tracheal intubation under direct vision. The results achieved using narrow, low-profile straight laryngoscope blades with this technique are reviewed. The improved view obtained with this technique is a consequence of reduced tongue compression as compared with the Macintosh technique. This leads both to an improved line of sight, and to a reduced risk of backward displacement of the tongue and epiglottis. In addition, the molar or retromolar variation of the technique reduces the intrusion of maxillary structures into the line of sight, so that a better view of the larynx is achieved for a given degree of soft tissue compression. Paraglossal straight blade laryngoscopy may have an advantage over use of the Macintosh technique when intubation proves unexpectedly difficult. It is perhaps time to question standard teaching about the role of the curved blade in such patients or, more particularly, whether the technique of laryngoscopy as currently taught is optimal. The paraglossal straight blade technique needs to be practised in routine intubation before it can be used with confidence in difficult cases.",0,0
20535016,"A Phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine for sedation during awake fiberoptic intubation","GABA-mediated sedatives have respiratory depressant properties that may be detrimental in patients with difficult airways. In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter, Phase IIIb Food and Drug Administration study, safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine compared with placebo were evaluated as the primary sedative for awake fiberoptic intubation (AFOI). Patients were randomized to receive dexmedetomidine or saline. Patients were sedated with dexmedetomidine or rescue midazolam to achieve targeted sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥ 2) before topicalization and throughout AFOI. Primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients requiring rescue midazolam; secondary efficacy endpoints were total dose of rescue midazolam, percentage requiring additional rescue nonmidazolam medications, anesthesiologist's assessment of ease of subject care, and patient recall and satisfaction 24 hours postoperatively. Less rescue midazolam was required to maintain Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥2 (47.3% vs. 86.0%, P < 0.001), and supplemental midazolam dose was lower (1.07 ± 1.5 mg vs. 2.85 ± 3.0 mg, P < 0.001) with dexmedetomidine compared with placebo. More Mallampati Class IV patients treated with dexmedetomidine were successfully intubated without midazolam than with placebo (66.7% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.009). Dexmedetomidine decreased blood pressure and heart rate compared with placebo patients sedated with midazolam. Patients and anesthesiologists showed favorable satisfaction responses in both groups. Adverse events and patient recall were similar in both groups. Dexmedetomidine is effective as the primary sedative in patients undergoing AFOI. Some patients may require small supplemental doses of midazolam, in addition to dexmedetomidine, to achieve sufficient sedation for AFOI. Dexmedetomidine provides another AFOI option for sedation of patients with difficult airways.",0,0
23098202,"Inheritance patterns of morphological laterality in mouth opening of zebrafish, Danio rerio","The inheritance patterns of asymmetry in mouth opening in zebrafish were investigated using crossing experiments. Zebrafish exhibit asymmetric laterality in mouth opening, with each individual having either a leftward (righty) or rightward (lefty) bias. All righty incrosses produced only righty F(1), whereas all lefty incrosses resulted in an F(1) L:R ratio of 2:1. All test crosses between lefty and righty individuals resulted in an F(1) L:R=1:1. These results were consistent with the hereditary pattern for Japanese medaka, three Tanganyikan cichlids, and a Japanese riverine goby. The pattern suggests a one-locus two-allele Mendelian model of inheritance, with the lefty allele being dominant over righty and the dominant homozygote being lethal. To determine the reason for the absence of lefty homozygotes, the survival rates of the offspring were examined according to developmental stage. Survival did not differ among combinations of parent laterality. Thus the mechanism underlying the lethality of the dominant homozygote remains unclear. This study showed that the mouth-opening laterality of zebrafish is genetically determined and that the direction follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern that is shared among cypriniform zebrafish, beloniform medaka, perciform cichlids, and a goby, suggesting a common genetic background in mouth-opening laterality among these species.",0,0
15298876,Comparison of the LMA-ProSeal and LMA-Classic in children,"Background: The LMA-ProSeal is a new laryngeal mask airway with a rear cuff and drainage tube that allows a higher seal pressure than the LMA-Classic for the same intra-cuff pressure, and it permits drainage of gastric secretions and access to the alimentary tract. The LMA-ProSeal can be used in children but it does not have a rear cuff. This study compared the LMA-ProSeal and the LMA-Classic in children for ease of insertion, airway sealing pressure and fibre-optic visualization. Methods: Sixty ASA I-II children undergoing herniorrhaphy, orchiopexy or myringotomy were included. The patients were randomly assigned to size 2 LMA-Classic trade mark or size 2 LMA-ProSeal groups for airway management. We assessed success rates at first attempt of insertion, airway sealing pressure, fibre-optic position, success rates of gastric tube placement and postoperative blood staining of the device, tongue-lip-dental trauma and hoarseness. Results: There was no statistical difference between the two groups for the success rates at first attempt of insertion, airway sealing pressure and fibre-optic position. Gastric tube insertion was successful in 90% of cases in the LMA-ProSeal group. The LMA-Classic had a higher rate of postoperative blood staining, but there was no tongue-lip-dental trauma or hoarseness in either group. Conclusion: We conclude that ease of insertion and airway sealing pressure are similar between the LMA-ProSeal and the LMA-Classic in children.",0,0
18699873,"The effects of head flexion on airway seal, quality of ventilation and orogastric tube placement using the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway","This prospective self-controlled study was designed to evaluate the influences of head flexion on airway seal, quality of ventilation, and orogastric tube placement through the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (ProSeal LMA) in 80 anaesthetised, paralysed adult patients. After the ProSeal LMA was inserted and the cuff pressure was set at 5.9 kPa, ventilation quality, airway seal pressure, fibreoptic positions of the cuff and the drainage tube, orogastric tube placement and efficacy of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) were assessed in two randomly selected positions: neutral and flexed position. When compared to the neutral head position, the head flexed significantly improved the airway seal pressure and the quality of ventilation of the ProSeal LMA (p < 0.05). Fibreoptic scores of the cuff position did not correlate with either the ability to obtain excellent or adequate ventilation through the ProSeal LMA or the ability to generate an airway seal pressure of >or= 2 kPa. Orogastric tube placement via the drainage tube was successful on the first attempt in all patients in the neutral position compared with seven failures following three attempts in the flexed position (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two head positions in the volume of air required to obtain an intracuff pressure of 5.9 kPa, fibreoptic score of the drainage tube position, and expiratory tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressure during IPPV (p > 0.05). In conclusion, head flexion improves airway seal and ventilation quality of the ProSeal LMA. However, placement of an orogastric tube via the drainage tube is impaired in the flexed position compared to the neutral position. Fibreoptic scoring of the ProSeal cuff position is not an accurate test to assess the airway seal and ventilation function.",0,0
25740093,Predicting difficult airways: 3-3-2 rule or 3-3 rule?,"Background: The goal of this study was to assess the value of the 3-3 rule and the 3-3-1 rule in predicting difficult airways. Methods: The authors conducted an observational study over a 6-month period. For each consenting adult patient undergoing general anesthesia, preoperative patient characteristics and data regarding difficult airway assessments and airway outcomes were collected. The 3-3-2 rule, 3-3-1 rule and 3-3 rule were included in preoperative difficult airway assessments. The 3-3-1 rule is defined as an interincisor distance (IID) less than three fingers, a hyoid-mental distance (HMD) less than three fingers, and a hyoid-thyroid cartilage distance (HTD) less than one finger. Results: Among the 732 patients who were successfully recruited in this study, 67 patients had difficult laryngoscopy (DL) (9.2 %), and 25 patients had difficult intubation (DI) (3.4 % of the total). All of the DI patients were also DL patients (25/67, 37.3 %). The AUC of the 3-3-2, 3-3, and 3-3-1 rules for predicting difficult laryngoscopy were 0.702, 0.709, and 0.631, respectively. Significant differences between the 3-3-2 and 3-3-1 rules as well as between the 3-3 and 3-3-1 rules were evident. The AUC values for the 3-3-2, 3-3, and 3-3-1 rules for predicting DI were 0.830, 0.822, and 0.725, respectively. Conclusions: The 3-3 rule and the 3-3-2 rule are similar regarding their ability to predict difficult airways. A HTD less than two fingers or one finger is not predictive of DV or DI.",0,0
15933515,Head and neck physical examination: comparison between nonapneic and obstructive sleep apnea patients,"Study objectives: The purpose of this study was to apply a systematic physical examination, used to evaluate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, in nonapneic patients. Design: Study was prospective. Setting: Patients were seen in the sleep laboratory and department of otorhinolaryngology. Patients or participants: Nonapneic patients (n = 100) were involved in the study. Interventions: Physical examination to evaluate facial skeleton, pharyngeal soft tissue, rhinoscopy, and body mass index. Data were compared with a previously published study (2003) on a group of OSA patients (n = 223). Measurements and results: Skeletal examination detected retrognathism in 6%, class II occlusion in 12%, and high-arched hard palate in 11%. The modified Mallampati classification showed 54% in class I to II and 46% in class III to IV. Only 1% of nonapneic patients had tonsils of degree III to IV. Oropharynx evaluation showed web palate in 38%, posterior palate in 19%, thick palate in 10%, thick uvula in 10%, long uvula 15%, voluminous lateral wall in 11%, and tongue edge crenations in 28%. Anterior rhinoscopy detected significant septal deviation in 1% and turbinate hypertrophy in 31% of patients. Conclusions: The head and neck physical examination, considering both skeletal and soft tissue alterations, illustrated significant differences between nonapneic and OSA patients. Body mass index, modified Mallampati classification, tonsils hypertrophy, and high-arched hard palate previously related to the presence of sleep apnea in the literature showed different outcomes in nonapneic patients. Nonapneic patients had less alterations in nasal anatomy (severe septal deviation and enlarged turbinate). Skeletal parameters, such as retropositioned mandible and angle class II occlusion, were less frequent in nonapneic patients.",0,0
21493429,Secondary airway lesions in laryngomalacia: a different perspective,"Objective: To document the prevalence of secondary airway lesions (SALs) among children with laryngomalacia (LM). Study design: A cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Single practice in a tertiary care pediatric facility. Subjects and methods: Patients diagnosed with LM were initially identified from a prospectively kept surgical database. Patients with cardiac/large-vessel malformations, prematurity, repeated or prolonged intubations, acute infections, or prior airway surgery were excluded. Only children who had a full examination of the airway were included. Other associated diagnoses along with demographics, surgical intervention, and type of LM were included. Results: Over an 8-year period, 1112 patients underwent laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. A total of 108 consecutive cases were diagnosed with LM (78 primary diagnosis and 30 secondary diagnosis). After excluding 17 with disorders associated with large airway disease, 91 LM patients were included. The mean age was 553.23 days (ranging between 5 days and 15 years); 60 were boys and 31 were girls. The prevalence of SALs was 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.65-7.76; 7 children; 4 subglottic stenosis, 4 tracheomalacia, 1 bronchomalacia, and 1 choanal atresia). Fifty-nine patients underwent supraglottoplasties, while 1 patient had a tracheostomy. Conclusions: After accounting for conditions known to be associated with large airway lesions, the prevalence of SALs associated with laryngomalacia was much less than previously reported. The authors hypothesize that the upper-end figures are a reflection of highly select cohorts and the inclusion of patients with other pathology known to be associated with subglottic stenosis, tracheomalacia, and bronchomalacia and low thresholds for diagnosing mild subglottic stenosis.",0,0
25927657,Comparison of the Airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope for double-lumen tube intubation in patients with predicted normal airways: a prospective randomized trial,"Background: The Airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope are commonly used in many airway scenarios. However, their features have not been fully described for double-lumen tube intubation. A prospective randomized study was designed to compare their intubation performances in thoracic surgery patients. Methods: Seventy ASA physical status I and II patients with predicted normal airway were scheduled for thoracic surgeries with double-lumen tube intubation. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups and intubated with either the Airtraq laryngoscope (group A, n = 35) or the GlideScope (group G, n = 35). Airway assessments were performed prior to anesthesia, and all patients were induced with a standard anesthetic regimen. The Cormack-Lehane grades were initially evaluated with a Macintosh laryngoscope and subsequently with the group-specific laryngoscope before intubation. Intubation time was recorded as the primary outcome. The Cormack-Lehane grade, the success of the first intubation attempt, the intubation difficulty scales and ease of tube advancement were noted. Hemodynamic variables during intubation and incidence of post-operative sore throat were documented as well. Results: The intubation time of group A was shorter than that of group G (36.6 ± 20.2 s vs. 54.6 ± 25.7 s, p = 0.002). The Cormack-Lehane grade (I/II/III/IV) was significantly better in group A (33/2/0/0 vs. 28/7/0/0, p = 0.042). The mean arterial pressure and heart rate rose to higher levels during intubation with the GlideScope than with the Airtraq laryngoscope. The success of the first intubation attempt and the intubation difficulty scales were comparable between the two groups. The numbers of patients who experienced postoperative sore throat were similar (6 vs. 8) in the two groups. Conclusions: Compared with the GlideScope, the specially designed Airtraq laryngoscope might be more suitable for double-lumen tube intubations in patients with predicted normal airway.

The oral intubation route was impossible, and a fiberoptic nasal intubation under local anesthesia was performed. Implications: We report a case of a 42-yr-old patient who underwent surgery for a penetrating craniofacial injury caused by an arrow. Because of the median vertical trajectory of the arrow (from the chin to the frontal skull), only the right nasal approach was accessible for endotracheal intubation.

19020139,The extended Mallampati score and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus are predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in the morbidly obese,"Background: The modified Mallampati (MMP) classification is a standard method of oropharyngeal evaluation for predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Previous studies have demonstrated that the predictive value of the MMP is improved when the patient's craniocervical junction is extended rather than neutral (Extended Mallampati Score, EMS). In the present study, we compared the predictive value of the MMP and EMS in the morbidly obese. Methods: We performed a prospective study of adult patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) > or = 40 over a 12-mo period comparing the MMP and EMS. The performance of the MMP, EMS, and other commonly used tests was compared for the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy, defined as a Cormack-Lehane grade of 3 or 4. Positioning and direct laryngoscopic techniques were not standardized. The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation was compared in patients with BMI > or = or < 40. Results: Three-hundred-forty-six patients with a BMI > or = 40 were evaluated with both the MMP and EMS and received direct laryngoscopy. On average, craniocervical extension decreased the MMP class (P < 0.0001). Compared to the MMP, the EMS improved specificity and predictive value while maintaining sensitivity. Compared to the MMP and other tests, an EMS class of 3 or 4 and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were the only statistically significant predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in the morbidly obese. There was no difference in the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy or intubation in the morbidly obese compared to patients with a BMI < 40. Conclusions: The EMS was superior to the MMP in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in the morbidly obese population. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus also warrants further investigation as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in this population. Finally, this study supports previous findings that morbid obesity is not itself a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy or intubation.",1,1
22313071,Incidence of difficult intubation in intensive care patients: analysis of contributing factors,"Difficulties in endotracheal intubation increase morbidity and mortality in intensive care patients. We studied the problem in surgical intensive care patients with the aim of risk reduction. Patients intubated in the intensive care unit were evaluated. The intubations were performed or supervised by anaesthetists following the algorithm valid at the time of the study. Fifty percent of the 198 intubations were performed by specialist anaesthetists, 41.5% by anaesthesia trainees and 8.5% by surgical trainees. The initial attempt was by direct laryngoscopy (n=173), flexible fibrescope (n=8) or blind nasal technique (n=17). When direct laryngoscopy failed (n=7), intubation was accomplished with an intubating laryngeal mask airway (n=5), Frova stylet (n=1) or fibrescope (n=1). Thirty percent were rated as easy, 47% as moderately easy and 23% as difficult. Difficult intubations were associated with a higher incidence of anatomic anomalies, difficult bag-mask ventilation and severe oxygen desaturation. Every intubation in the ICU setting should be considered potentially difficult. The existing algorithm should be modified to incorporate the American Society of Anesthesiologists difficult airway algorithm adapted to the needs of the intensive care unit. A training program for alternative methods of airway management for difficult intubations should be established.",0,0

21797086,[Experience with the proseal laryngeal mask in ventriculoperitoneal shunting],"Objective: To describe the use, utility, safety, and effectiveness of the Proseal laryngeal mask for airway management in patients undergoing ventriculoperitonea shunting. Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients in whom the Proseal laryngeal mask was used during ventriculoperitoneal shunting between January 2006 and October 2009. Patient demographic characteristics, airway assessments, type of anesthesia, quality of ventilation, and perioperative complications were recorded. Results: Of the 43 patients included, 8 (18.6%) had at least 1 difficult airway criterion. We were able to insert the Proseal laryngeal mask in all patients. Ventilation was optimal in 39 (91%) patients, with maintenance of end-expiratory carbon dioxide pressures between 35 and 40 mm Hg and airway pressures above 25 cm H2O throughout the procedures. Air leaks developed in 3 cases (7%) when the patient was placed in a lateral-cervical position for surgery; these patients required orotracheal intubation before surgery could begin. Mean duration of surgery was 53 minutes. Awakening occurred without incident in all cases. Conclusions: The Proseal laryngeal mask is useful for airway management in patients undergoing ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Due to the forced position of the neck, however, it may be necessary to reposition the mask or even proceed to orotracheal intubation in some cases. As is the case for other advanced uses, experience with the device is necessary. Material for managing a difficult airway should be on hand.",0,0
8760639,[Modified technique of Waters for retrograde intubation. Apropos of a case of difficult intubation],"The authors describe a case of impossible intubation by classical means in an obese 37-yr old woman, affected with encephalopathy, hydrocephalus and severe psychomotor retardation. After failure of intubation by classical methods using a flexible introducer, the patient was intubated by Waters retrograde technique using an epidural catheter passed through the thyrocricoid membrane and recovered in the mouth. Following this guide the endotracheal tube passed the glottis fairly easily with the help of a flexible ""mouse tail-ended"" introducer (C-Mettro, Cook, 19.0.80) inserted into the same tube to facilitate alignment of distal tube and trachea. The authors conclude that the combination of epidural catheter and flexible introducer may facilitate the retrograde technique performance; they consider this technique to be an interesting alternative when endotracheal intubation is difficult or impossible by usual methods.",0,0
20233311,Dentofacial characteristics as indicator of obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome in patients with severe obesity,"Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a complex disease with a multifactor aetiology. OSAHS is strongly associated with obesity, but there are many other clinical risk factors, such as the dentofacial characteristics of hard and soft tissues, hyoid bone position, neck circumference, upper airway spaces and nasal respiration. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out involving 13 patients (one man and 12 women) with severe obesity in order to evaluate specific physical dentofacial characteristics through a cephalometric examination. Cephalometry was analysed using 29 measurements of the hard and soft tissues of the craniofacial structures and dimensions of the upper airways. The demographic data revealed a mean body mass index of 48 ± 6.26 kg m(-2) and cervical circumference of 43 ± 3.69 cm. No patient exhibited important facial asymmetry and facial types 1 (normal) and 3 (mandible forward) were the most prevalent. Septal deviation was observed in 46% of patients. The most prevalent modified Mallampati index score was between 3 and 4, while grade 1 was the most prevalent tonsillar hypertrophy index score (46%). Cephalometry revealed angular and linear measurements with normally acceptable values for the hard tissues. Obese patients seem to have a normal craniofacial structure and the risk of developing OSAHS is especially related to obesity.",0,0
27004945,Comparison of Miller and Airtraq laryngoscopes for orotracheal intubation by physicians wearing CBRN protective equipment during infant resuscitation: a randomized crossover simulation study,"Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of orotracheal intubation with the Miller laryngoscope compared with the Airtraq laryngoscope by emergency and pediatric physicians wearing CBRN-PPE type III on infant manikins with conventional airway. We hypothesized that in this situation, the orotracheal intubation with the Airtraq laryngoscope would be faster and more effective than with the Miller laryngoscope. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, crossover, single-center study who recruited emergency department physicians on a voluntary basis. Each physician performed a total of 20 intubation trials while in CBRN-PPE with the two intubation techniques, Miller and Airtraq. Intubations by each airway device were tested over ten consecutive runs. The order of use of one or the other devices was randomized with a ratio of 1:1. The primary endpoint was overall orotracheal intubation success. Results: Fifty-five emergency and pediatric physicians were assessed for eligibility. Forty-one physicians were included in this study and 820 orotracheal intubation attempts were performed. The orotracheal intubation success rate with the Airtraq laryngoscope was higher than with the Miller (99% vs. 92%; p-adjusted <.001). The orotracheal intubation and glottis visualization times decreased with the number of attempts (p <.001). The median orotracheal intubation time with the Airtraq laryngoscope was lower than with the Miller laryngoscope (15 s vs. 20 s; p-adjusted <.001). The median glottis visualization time with the Airtraq laryngoscope and with the Miller laryngoscope were not different (6.0 s vs. 7.5 s; p-adjusted =.237). Thirty-four (83 %) physicians preferred the Airtraq laryngoscope versus 6 (15 %) for the Miller (p-adjusted <.001). Discussion: For tracheal intubation by physicians wearing CBRN-PPE during infant resuscitation simulation, we showed that the orotracheal intubation success rate with the Airtraq laryngoscope was higher than with the Miller laryngoscope and that orotracheal intubation time with the Airtraq laryngoscope was lower than with the Miller laryngoscope. Conclusions: It seems useful to train the physicians in emergency departments in the use of pediatric Airtraq and for the management of CBRN risks.",0,0
10933102,Induced sputum cell counts: their usefulness in clinical practice,"Airway inflammation is fundamental to the aetiology and persistence of asthma and other airway conditions. The presence and type of airway inflammation can be difficult to detect clinically, delaying the introduction of appropriate treatment. Induced sputum cell counts are a relatively noninvasive, safe and reliable method of identifying airway inflammation. They can accurately discriminate eosinophilic airway inflammation from noneosinophilic airway inflammation, and help guide therapy. Eosinophilic airway inflammation is steroid responsive whilst noneosinophilic (usually neutrophilic) inflammation generally is not. Macrophages containing haemosiderin can be useful in detecting left ventricular dysfunction and macrophages containing lipid are suggestive of oropharyngeal reflux with microaspiration, both of which can complicate or confuse assessment of airway disease. To date, studies using induced sputum are primarily observational. Management studies based on examination of induced sputum are now needed to validate the clinical utility of this test.",0,0
11878121,[Difficult intubation in patients with endotracheal prosthesis],"We report a case of two consecutive episodes of difficult intubation in a patient with an endotracheal Dumon's prosthesis inserted two years before. Despite several preanaesthetic visits and ENT examination, the absence of recollection by the patient and the lack of information in her previous medical records led to the impossibility to introduce a normal tube into her trachea during two consecutive anaesthetic procedures. This case points out the limits of preanaesthetic visits. It allows to remind special measures that must be taken in patients having tracheal prosthesis and scheduled for anaesthesia and surgery.",0,0
15897417,Fetal surgery in otolaryngology: a new era in the diagnosis and management of fetal airway obstruction because of advances in prenatal imaging,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and outcome of prenatal imaging and fetal surgery in the diagnosis and management of fetal airway obstruction caused by cervical teratoma or lymphatic malformation. Setting: Tertiary care medical center. Patients A retrospective study of all consecutive fetal patients with cervical teratoma or lymphatic malformation between January 2001 and December 2003. Results: The indication was potential airway obstruction due to a fetal neck mass in 8 patients. Prenatal images were obtained by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, and were consistent with teratoma in 4 patients. The mean cervical mass was 8.3 x 7.3 x 6.7 cm, with airway obstruction suspected in all 4 patients. All 4 patients were successfully delivered by ex utero intrapartum treatment, during which 3 newborns required tracheotomy and 1 was successfully intubated. Prenatal images were consistent with lymphatic malformation in the remaining 4 patients. The mean cervical mass was 4.6 x 4.4 x 3.4 cm. There was no indication of airway obstruction based on prenatal images. All 4 patients had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Conclusions: Technological advances in prenatal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging have improved the ability to diagnose congenital abnormalities in utero. This allows for proper assessment of the airway to prevent any unexpected problems at delivery. We believe that many airway emergencies can be avoided by prenatal imaging and initiation of airway management in the prenatal period.",0,0
8166796,The distance between the grille of the laryngeal mask airway and the vocal cords. Is conventional intubation through the laryngeal mask safe?,"The distance between the grille of the laryngeal mask airway and the vocal cords was measured with a fibreoptic bronchoscope in 30 male and 30 female patients. The mean distance was 3.6 cm (SD 0.5 cm; range 2.5-4.7 cm) in males and 3.1 cm (SD 0.5 cm; range 2.0-4.2 cm) in females. These results suggest that the cuff of an uncut 6.0 mm tracheal tube would often lie between the vocal cords when the tube is fully inserted through a laryngeal mask airway. To avoid this complication, the tracheal tube must protrude more than 9.5 cm beyond the grille of the laryngeal mask airway. When either neck extension or flexion is required, the laryngeal mask airway should be removed as the margin of safety is small.",0,0

24817827,The use of VivaSight™ single lumen endotracheal tube in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy,"Background: The population of obese patients is progressively growing and bariatric operations are becoming increasingly common. Morbidly obese patients require special anesthetic care and are often considered to be difficult to ventilate and intubate. The VivaSight™ Single Lumen tube is an endotracheal tube with a camera embedded in its tip. The view from the tip appears continuously on a monitor in the anesthesiologist's vicinity. The aim of this study was to assess the VivaSight™ in comparison with conventional endotracheal tube as an aid in the intubation and surveillance of tube position during surgery of obese patients. Methods: This is a prospective study of 72 adult obese patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The patients were randomly assigned to be intubated by either the VivaSight™ (40 patients, test group) or a conventional endotracheal tube (32 patients, control group). Data on the patients, the pre-operative airway evaluation, the endotracheal intubation and the post-operative outcome were collected and compared. Results: The Mallampati scores were significantly higher in the test group than in the control group. Endotracheal intubation took 29 ± 10 and 24 ± 8 seconds using the VivaSight™ and a conventional tube respectively (p = 0.02). Three of the patients in the control group, while none of those in the test group, had soft tissue injury (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We found the VivaSight™ SL to be helpful in the endotracheal intubation and continuous surveillance of tube position in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.",0,0
16517333,Management of airway obstruction caused by nasal packing material in a trauma patient,Airway management of patients with facial trauma is challenging.

24063132,[Current practice of pediatric airway management],"Recent advances in pediatric airway management contribute to a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality in pediatric anesthesia. This article reviews the current concept of routine and difficult pediatric airway with special emphasis on preoperative pediatric airway assessment. Newly introduced airway devices designed for pediatric patients may facilitate ventilation and intubation although their efficacy and safety profiles in routine and difficult situations remain undetermined. Based on the pediatric protocol recently published by the Difficult Airway Society (DAS), we discuss structured algorithms for unanticipated difficult pediatric airway. Simulation technology will aid acquisition and retention of pediatric airway management skills.",0,0
17031078,Unanticipated difficult intubation,"Purpose of review: While there are many predictors of difficult laryngoscopic intubation, they all have a low positive predictive value. Therefore, unanticipated difficult laryngoscopic intubation will likely occur in our day-to-day practice. This review discusses recent developments in alternative airway devices and techniques in addressing these difficulties. Recent findings: There is emerging evidence to suggest that new supraglottic devices are useful rescue appliances, particularly for unanticipated difficulties in laryngoscopic intubation. Other new intubating devices, including the Glidescope, may also play an important role in the management of patients with unanticipated difficult or failed laryngoscopic intubation. Summary: The evidence to date does not always arm us with the ability to predict a difficult laryngoscopic intubation. Therefore, it is imperative that we equip ourselves with devices and techniques that will help us to maintain effective oxygenation and ventilation in a safe manner in the face of such failure.",0,0
17962241,Predictive value of the El-Ganzouri multivariate risk index for difficult tracheal intubation: a comparison of Glidescope videolaryngoscopy and conventional Macintosh laryngoscopy,"Background: The predictive value of the El-Ganzouri risk index (EGRI) for difficult intubation has been evaluated using Macintosh laryngoscopy as reference standard. The Glidescope videolaryngoscope provides improved visualization of the glottis. We studied the predictive value of the EGRI using videolaryngoscopy as reference standard. Methods: Data from two subsequent groups of patients, intubated with Macintosh laryngoscopy (ML, n = 994) and videolaryngoscopy (VL, n = 843), were retrospectively analysed. The EGRI was taken as index test. The two types of laryngoscopy were adopted as reference for the presence of Cormack and Lehane grading III-IV. For both groups, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative post-test probabilities (PTP) were calculated for thresholds on the EGRI scale. Receiver operating characteristic curves and corresponding areas (AUC) were obtained. Results: Sensitivity and specificity were 69.7% and 66.3% at the cut-off value of 2 in the ML group, and 93.3% and 76.6% at the cut-off value of 3 in the VL group. Corresponding positive and negative PTP were 12.81% and 3.15% in the ML group, and 6.73% and 0.16% in the VL group. At the threshold of 4, positive and negative PTP were 31.34% and 4.85% in the ML group. At the threshold of 7, positive and negative PTP were 85.71% and 1.08% in the VL group. The AUC was 0.74 in the ML group and 0.91 in the VL group. Conclusions: The predictive value of the EGRI may have been underestimated due to limited accuracy of Macintosh laryngoscopy. Using videolaryngoscopy, the EGRI might be reconsidered as a decisional tool.",1,1
19299790,A comparison of lighted stylet (Surch-Lite) and direct laryngoscopic intubation in patients with high Mallampati scores,"Background: A lighted stylet is an effective alternative to a direct laryngoscope and has been reported to be particularly useful in patients with difficult airways. A high Mallampati class indicates poor visibility of the oropharyngeal structures. Because a lighted stylet does not require direct oropharyngeal visualization, we hypothesized that the lighted stylet would be easier to use than a direct laryngoscope in patients with a high Mallampati score. To examine our hypothesis, we performed a prospective, randomized study comparing a lighted stylet (Surch-Lite) with direct laryngoscopy in patients with high Mallampati scores. Success rate, time required for intubation, and hemodynamic changes were compared. Methods: Mallampati Class III patients were enrolled and were randomly assigned to the Surch-Lite group (Group SL) or the direct laryngoscopy group (Group DL). Patients' tracheas were intubated with the randomly selected intubation device after induction of general anesthesia. Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure were measured immediately before and every 30 s after intubation for 5 min. The time to intubation and success rate were recorded. Postoperative pharyngolaryngeal complaints were also assessed. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled in each group. The success rate on the first attempt was significantly higher in Group SL (29 of 30) than in Group DL (24 of 30). The difference between maximal HR and baseline HR was significantly higher in Group DL (25 +/- 13 bpm) than in Group SL (16 +/- 10 bpm). The change in mean arterial blood pressure was also higher in Group DL (38 +/- 14 mm Hg) than in Group SL (20 +/- 13 mm Hg). The time to intubation was significantly shorter in Group SL (12 +/- 6 s) than in Group DL (17 +/- 12 s). Postoperative pharyngolaryngeal complaints were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: The Surch-Lite showed a higher success rate on the first intubation attempt and produced an attenuated hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation of patients with high Mallampati score. Thus, the Surch-Lite is an effective alternative to direct laryngoscopy in these patients.",0,0
10764179,Airway changes during Cesarean hysterectomy,"Purpose: To document whether hemorrhage and fluid administration during peripartum hysterectomy results in changes in the airway that may predispose to subsequent difficult intubation, in the event that intraoperative general anesthesia is required during regional anesthesia. Clinical features: A 32-yr-old underwent peripartum hysterectomy for placenta accreta. Blood loss of 5.5 L occurred during surgery requiring 6 L crystalloid, 1 L hetastarch, five units packed RBCs and two units fresh frozen plasma. Airway changes were followed using Samsoon's modification of Mallampati airway classification. In addition, airway photographs were obtained using a Polaroid camera. The airway of the patient changed from class 2 preoperatively to class 4 in the immediate postoperative period. The airway gradually returned to normal over the ensuing 48 hr, during which a negative fluid balance of 4 L occurred due to substantial postoperative diuresis. Conclusion: Peripartum airway changes were detected during Cesarean hysterectomy and fluid resuscitation that gradually returned to normal within 48 hr after surgery.",0,0
25669082,[Comparison of difficulty in airway intubation with aging. Study on 71 subjects who had an airway intubation 20-or-more years earlier],"Background: Although there are reports targeting children with micrognathia, there is no report how orotracheal intubation difficulty of normal adult patients changes with aging. We surveyed orotracheal intubation episodes after more than 20 years from the initial surgery. Methods: Seventy one patients underwent general anesthesia again after 23 years in average. Change of orotracheal intubation difficulty was checked retrospectively. The same anesthesiologist assessed 73.2% of cases. Results: Intubation of 4 patients became more difficult, in one patient it became easier, and in the remainder did not change. There was no relation between the change in difficulty and presence or absence of maxillary incisor. Restricted neck mobility or opening of mouth caused by progressive musculoskeletal diseases made orotracheal intubation more difficult Conclusions: We conclude that in adult patients, if there are no changes in the degree of opening mouth and neck mobility, almost all patients remained in the same situation regarding orotracheal intubation after 23 years in average.",0,0
19700274,A retrospective analysis of airway management in obese patients at a teaching institution,"Study objective: To identify patient characteristics that influence the choice of awake fiberoptic intubation (AFI) versus intubation after general anesthesia in obese patients. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Memorial Hermann Hospital, Houston, TX. Measurements: Perioperative records of 283 obese patients [body mass index (BMI) >34 kg/m2] who underwent elective surgery between January 1991 and December 1999 were studied. Patients' data were divided into two groups according to method of induction and intubation: asleep direct laryngoscopy versus AFI. Patient demographics, BMI, Mallampati airway classification, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, hiatal hernia, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were compared between the two groups. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Main results: AFI was performed in 12 (4.2%) obese patients, and direct laryngoscopy was performed in 271 (95.8%) obese patients. Difficult intubation was reported in 21 (7.4%) cases, and there were no reported cases of failed intubations. Bivariate analyses demonstrated that AFI patients were more likely to have a BMI > or = 60 kg/m2 (P < 0.001), Mallampati class III or IV airway (P < 0.001), and be men (P = 0.004). These three factors were also statistically significant in the multivariate logistic regression. In particular, each one kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with a 7% increased likelihood of AFI. Men were approximately 4 times likelier than women to have an AFI. Compared with patients with a Mallampati Class I or II airway, those with Mallampati Classes III or IV were about 26 times as likelier to have an AFI. Conclusions: Patients selected for AFI were predominantly men, with a Mallampati Class III or IV airway, and BMI > or = 60 kg/m2.",1,1
12844024,[Bronchial anthracosis and pulmonary mica overload],"Introduction: The discovery of anthracotic plaques generally suggests either a history of tuberculosis or occupational exposure to dust. Other etiologies should, however, be considered. Case reports: A 60-year-old Iranian woman presented with a history of dyspnoea and with chest radiography demonstrating calcified hilar lymph nodes and interstitial lung disease. Pulmonary function tests revealed airway obstruction. A diffuse bronchial inflammatory appearance accompanied by anthracotic plaques was found at bronchoscopy, which prompted transmission electron microscopy analysis of non-fibrous mineral particles in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). This demonstrated the presence of an alveolar particle count greater than 10(7) particles/ml (p/ml), significantly more than that found in 42 BALF samples taken from controls without a history of occupational dust exposure (4,4.10(5) p/ml). Furthermore, the analysis also revealed an abnormally elevated proportion of mica particles (64%). Two other individuals, a 68 year-old Moroccan woman and a 70-year-old Algerian woman, who had anthracotic plaques, but no radiological evidence of interstitial lung disease, also underwent mineral analysis of BALF. Neither were found to have a raised alveolar particle count, but the mineral profile showed an abnormally elevated proportion of micas (62%) for one patient, and silica crystalline (40%) as well as micas (32%) for the other patient. Conclusions: Even if mica is present in 30 to 90% of the BALF, the results observed in these three patients raises the possibility of non-occupational environmental exposure and that anthracotic plaques might be associated with domestic pollution.",0,0
9603595,Difficult intubation from gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults,"Two cases of difficult intubation are presented. Both cases presented with red swollen arytenoids, swollen false vocal cords, and subglottic stenosis. Tracheal intubation could not be achieved for these reasons. Both patients were placed on gastrointestinal prokinetic drugs and histamine-two blocker, as a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was made. In one case, follow-up by an otolaryngotic surgeon showed reversal of the above findings. In the other case, one tracheal intubation was achieved eventually. GERD occurs frequently. Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion for GERD-related airway changes so as to avoid potential difficult intubations.",0,0
11233465,A prospective randomized trial comparing the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) with the laryngeal mask for elective minor surgery in female patients,"Objective: The cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA), a modified Guedel-type airway with a cuff at the distal end, has recently been introduced into anesthetic practice. The aim of this study was to compare the COPA with the well established laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Special consideration was granted to the difficult airway. Patients and methods: Two hundred and fifty-two women of ASA class I or II undergoing elective gynecological or breast surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either cuffed oropharyngeal or laryngeal mask airway management. Insertion and removal of the device, airway maintenance throughout the procedure, and postoperative course and complications were assessed. Results: A patent airway was obtained with either device in all patients. Global first-time success rates for insertion were similar in the two study groups. Initial failure of correct placement occurred more frequently in the COPA as compared to the LMA group if the interincisor gap was < 5 cm and mandibular protrusion impossible (p < 0.01). Neither thyromental distance nor Mallampati scores nor body mass index (BMI) were of relevance for insertion success. The incidence of postoperative complaints and of mucosal injuries was significantly higher with the LMA. Conclusion: On the whole, high overall success and low complication rates render COPA and LMA equally suitable for routine anesthetic airway management.",0,0
22011403,The use of the Airtraq® optical laryngoscope for routine tracheal intubation in high-risk cardio-surgical patients,"Background: The Airtraq® optical laryngoscope (Prodol Ltd., Vizcaya, Spain) is a novel disposable device facilitating tracheal intubation in routine and difficult airway patients. No data investigating routine tracheal intubation using the Airtaq® in patients at a high cardiac risk are available at present. Purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and hemodynamic implications of tracheal intubation with the Aitraq® optical laryngoscope, in high-risk cardio-surgical patients. Methods: 123 consecutive ASA III patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were routinely intubated with the Airtraq® laryngoscope. Induction of anesthesia was standardized according to our institutional protocol. All tracheal intubations were performed by six anesthetists trained in the use of the Airtraq® prior. Results: Overall success rate was 100% (n = 123). All but five patients trachea could be intubated in the first attempt (95,9%). 5 patients were intubated in a 2nd (n = 4) or 3rd (n = 1) attempt. Mean intubation time was 24.3 s (range 16-128 s). Heart rate, arterial blood pressure and SpO2 were not significantly altered. Minor complications were observed in 6 patients (4,8%), i.e. two lesions of the lips and four minor superficial mucosal bleedings. Intubation duration (p = 0.62) and number of attempts (p = 0.26) were independent from BMI and Mallampati score. Conclusion: Tracheal intubation with the Airtraq® optical laryngoscope was feasible, save and easy to perform in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In all patients, a sufficient view on the vocal cords could be obtained, independent from BMI and preoperative Mallampati score. Trial registration: DRKS 00003230.",0,0
16480461,Qualitative analysis of unanticipated difficult airway management,"Background: Unanticipated difficult airway management (DAM) is a major challenge for the anaesthesiologist and is associated with a risk of severe patient damage. We analysed 24 cases of unanticipated DAM for actual case management and anaesthesiologists knowledge, technical and non-technical skills. Anaesthesiologists' opinions, as well as environmental factors of importance for DAM proficiency, were also assessed. Methods: Departments of Anaesthesiology in three Copenhagen University Hospitals participated in a prospective study of unanticipated DAM. Anaesthesiologists recorded the details of the cases on a data sheet. Qualitative data were collected in a semi-structured interview if the value of the Intubation Difficulty Score (IDS) was more than five, if the value of the visual analogue scale score for mask ventilation was more than five or in the case of a registered complication. Transcripts were theme analysed independently by two analysts. Data sheets and interviews were used in the final evaluation. Results: All 24 cases concerned difficult tracheal intubation, and this was associated with difficult mask ventilation on four occasions. Management in three cases demonstrated strict adherence to a DAM practice guideline. Anaesthesiologists lacked standards for DAM. Inadequate knowledge, training and training facilities were documented. Sudden re-allocation of personnel and change of anaesthetic technique were potential risk factors for DAM. Insufficient airway assessment, insufficient patient information and registration of difficulties were demonstrated. Ethical issues were raised concerning the use of patients for skills practice. Conclusions: Both personal and system failures resulted in unanticipated DAM. There was insufficient knowledge of DAM and anaesthesiologists lacked DAM training. Standards for DAM and curricula for continuing education in DAM are needed.",0,0
22569403,Update on pediatric voice and airway disorders: assessment and care,"Purpose of review: To investigate the status of the recent literature focused on studying the assessment and treatment of pediatric voice and airway disorders using both established and novel techniques. Recent findings: Recent research regarding voice assessment and treatment reveals the use of systematic and innovative approaches when collecting instrumental and perceptual voice data. There are recent advancements in certain surgical interventions designed to minimize complications. Wider use of functional endoscopic imaging of the pediatric larynx is improving our understanding of childhood voice production and airway management. There is also an important emerging focus on quantifying the impact of having a childhood voice disorder through the use of new tools. Although there is an increase in pediatric voice and airway research, many studies tend to be entirely descriptive rather than quantitative. There continues to be little specific research that uses prospective, longer-term and formal voice outcomes before and after behavioral and surgical interventions. Summary: Pediatric voice and airway disorders are an important childhood health problem. Voice assessment in children should include formal perceptual and instrumental evaluations, including sophisticated acoustic, aerodynamic and imaging modalities. The care of these children requires a collaborative approach that includes systematic and innovative treatment methods.",0,0
10365012,Comparison of four methods for assessing airway sealing pressure with the laryngeal mask airway in adult patients,"We have compared four tests for assessing airway sealing pressure with the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) to test the hypothesis that airway sealing pressure and inter-observer reliability differ between tests. We studied 80 paralysed, anaesthetized adult patients. Four different airway sealing pressure tests were performed in random order on each patient by two observers blinded to each other's measurements: test 1 involved detection of an audible noise; test 2 was detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide in the oral cavity; test 3 was observation of the aneroid manometer dial as the pressure increased to note the airway pressure at which the dial reached stability; and test 4 was detection of an audible noise by neck auscultation. Mean airway sealing pressure ranged from 19.5 to 21.3 cm H2O and intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.95-0.99. Inter-observer reliability of all tests was classed as excellent. The manometric stability test had a higher mean airway sealing pressure (P < 0.0001) and better inter-observer reliability (P < 0.0001) compared with the three other tests. We conclude that for clinical purposes all four tests are excellent, but that the manometric stability test may be more appropriate for researchers comparing airway sealing pressures.",0,0
8111943,Changing Mallampati score during labour,"We present the case of a changing Mallampati score during the course of labour in a healthy primigravida. On admission to hospital, the airway was assessed as Mallampati class I-II. At 5 cm cervical dilation, the woman began to bear down strenuously and continued this despite being advised of the inherent hazard. At 8 cm dilation, Caesarean delivery was contemplated because of fetal heart rate decelerations. Repeat airway evaluation revealed marked oedema of the lower pharynx giving rise to a Mallampati score of III-IV. Improvement of the fetal heart rate tracing permitted vaginal delivery under local infiltration. Postpartum, the Mallampati score was still III-IV. However, 12 hr later it had returned to the admission classification of I-II. We recommend that, in addition to the usual airway evaluation on admission, the assessment be repeated in the obstetric patient before induction of general anaesthesia.",0,0
22569030,Comparison of Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes with conventional laryngoscopy in a manikin study of simulated difficult intubation,"Background: When airway management is difficult, various measures can be taken to facilitate tracheal intubation. The Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes were developed for this purpose. We hypothesised that the Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes would perform better than a conventional laryngoscope in the management of a simulated difficult airway. We also hypothesised that the indirect laryngoscopes would perform comparably. Methods: In a randomised controlled study, 60 anaesthetists (30 with no or little experience and 30 with broader experience in the use of the Bullard laryngoscope, referred to as beginners and experts, respectively) performed three successive intubation attempts using conventional, Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes in two simulated difficult airway scenarios: neck immobilisation (scenario A) and neck immobilisation with additional tongue oedema (scenario B). The primary endpoint was overall intubation success rate. Secondary endpoints were time required for successful intubation, the amount of dental stress exerted during laryngoscopy and satisfaction with each airway device. Results: In scenario A, intubation success rates were 97-100% with all devices. In scenario B, all participants failed to intubate the trachea using the conventional laryngoscope. When using the Bullard laryngoscope, intubation success rates of 87-97% did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) from those during scenario A and between groups (beginners vs. experts). In contrast, when using the Airtraq laryngoscope, the overall intubation success rate was significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared with scenario A and compared with use of the Bullard laryngoscope, and differed between beginners and experts (20 and 50%, respectively). In cases of successful intubation, intubation times were comparable between devices and groups. Intubation times were longer during scenario B. Dental stress was always lower (P < 0.05) during use of the Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes compared with the conventional laryngoscope, lowest (P < 0.05) during use of the Bullard laryngoscope and (with the exception of use of the conventional laryngoscope by the experts) higher during scenario B than during scenario A. In scenario A, participants preferred both video laryngoscopes to the conventional laryngoscope. Conclusion: In a moderately difficult airway scenario, all laryngoscopes performed equally well. However, in a more difficult airway scenario, the Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes performed better than the conventional laryngoscope, with the Bullard device performing better than the Airtraq. This may be in part related to differing prior experiences of operators with the respective airway devices.",0,0
25999002,Predictors of difficult intubation and the otolaryngology perioperative consult,"Airway management is one of the most important aspects of anesthesia care. Although the incidence of difficult intubation is low, predicting a potentially difficult airway can ensure that necessary staff and equipment are available. A preoperative airway evaluation should include a history and physical examination focusing on elements that can cause problems with intubation. When indicated, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy can add valuable information regarding the upper aerodigestive anatomy. Specific patient and situational factors should be considered. Alternative plans should be defined before the initiation of anesthesia. Management of a complex airway should be a coordinated effort between anesthesiologists and otolaryngologists.",0,0
20976507,Anesthesia in a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome),"We report a case of anesthesia during surgery to enlarge the foramen magnum in a pediatric patient with an extremely rare form of mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome). Airway control was unexpectedly easy, and intraoperative anesthetic management with total intravenous anesthesia went smoothly. However, the disease is progressive, with no guarantee that future anesthetic management of this patient will remain easy. If repeated surgery is required, thorough testing should be conducted over time to assess both airway and systemic complications. Nevertheless, we found that safe anesthetic management of affected patients is possible with anesthetics currently used in a clinical setting.",0,0
22134263,Subankylotic ostectomy for release of TMJ ankylosis using the transmasseteric anterior parotid approach,"Twelve patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis (5 bilateral and 7 unilateral) with preoperative maximal mouth opening ranging from 0 to 11 mm (mean, 2.25 [SD, 3.19] mm) were treated with a subankylotic ostectomy. Inclusion criteria in the study were patients older than 18 years with restricted mouth opening of less than 30 mm and radiographic evidence of temporomandibular joint ankylosis. The mean maximal postoperative mouth opening was 38.92 (SD, 3.11) mm. All patients showed good functional rehabilitation in terms of movement and speech with no radiographic evidence of recurrence and no occurrences of temporary or permanent facial nerve palsy, sialoceles, or salivary fistulae. As this technique does not encroach upon the mass of ankylotic bone but creates a pseudarthrosis beneath it, chances of recurrences are minimized. The entire length and width of the right ramus from the condyle to the angle region can be accessed with this technique.",0,0
15459613,Limitations of difficult airway prediction in patients intubated in the emergency department,"Study objective: Physiognomic assessment of difficult laryngoscopy before rapid sequence intubation has been advocated for all emergency department (ED) intubations. The study objectives were to evaluate whether Mallampati scores, thyromental distance, and neck mobility could have been assessed in non-cardiac arrest ED-intubated patients and determine whether such tests would have been feasible in our rapid sequence intubation-associated laryngoscopy failures. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 37 months of ED intubations using prospectively collected data from electronic medical records, critical care flow sheets, and a trauma registry. All non-cardiac arrest ED-intubated patients were included for analysis. Mallampati scoring was deemed unobtainable if patients could not follow simple commands. Neck mobility and thyromental measurement were deemed unobtainable with cervical spine precautions. Results: Eight hundred fifty intubations met the inclusion criteria, and 838 patients underwent rapid sequence intubation. Laryngoscopy failed in 3 patients who underwent rapid sequence intubation. Eight patients had awake nasal intubation, and 4 oral intubations were done without rapid sequence intubation. Four hundred fifty-two (53%) patients could not follow simple commands, and cervical spine immobilization was present in 370 (44%) patients. Only 32% of patients could follow simple commands and were not cervical spine immobilized. Among the 3 rapid sequence intubation laryngoscopy failures, no patients were following commands. Conclusion: Mallampati scoring, neck mobility testing, and measurement of thyromental distance could have been done in only one third of our non-cardiac arrest ED intubations and in none of the rapid sequence intubation failures. The inability to widely obtain these assessment tools, coupled with the low incidence of failed rapid sequence intubation, indicates limitations to using these screening tests in the ED setting.",0,0
20094734,Unexpectedly difficult intubation caused by subglottic stenosis in Wegener's granulomatosis,"A 76-year-old woman was scheduled to undergo abdominal aortic repair for progressive abdominal aortic aneurysm. After inducing general anesthesia, the 7.5-mm internal diameter (ID) tracheal tube could not be advanced below the level of the vocal cords because of resistance, and intubation was re-attempted several times using smaller tubes. An otolaryngologist was consulted and subglottic stenosis of unknown origin was suggested. The aortic repair was cancelled and tracheostomy was performed instead. She was diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis 46 days after the operation because she developed symptoms of renal dysfunction, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (c-ANCA). The patient was treated with steroids but died 89 days after the operation because of pulmonary bleeding and renal dysfunction. Tracheal stenosis is a rare presenting feature of Wegener's granulomatosis that usually occurs late in the disease; however, anesthesiologists around the world need to bear in mind that the disease can present airway symptoms and can be the cause of airway obstruction.",0,0
20689440,Airway management and morbid obesity,"Morbidly obese patients present with excess fatty tissue externally on the breast, neck, thoracic wall and abdomen and internally in the mouth, pharynx and abdomen. This excess tissue tends to make access (intubation, tracheostomy) to and patency (during sedation or mask ventilation) of the upper airway and the function of the lungs (decreased residual capacity and aggravated ventilation perfusion mismatch) worse than in lean patients. Proper planning and preparation of airway management is essential, including elevation of the patient's upper body, head and neck. Preoxygenation is mandatory in morbidly obese patients and should be followed by actions to counteract atelectasis formation. The decision as to weather to use a rapid sequence induction, an awake intubation or a standard induction with hypnotics should depend on the thorough airway examination and comorbidity and should not be based solely on whether morbid obesity is present or not. It is important to ensure sufficient depth of anaesthesia before initiating manipulation of the airway because inadequate anaesthesia depth predisposes to aspiration if airway management becomes difficult. The intubating laryngeal mask airway is more efficient in the morbidly obese patients than in lean patients and serves as a rescue device for both failed ventilation and failed intubation. In the 24 h following anaesthesia, morbidly obese patients experience frequent oxygen desaturation periods that can be counteracted by continuous positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation and physiotherapy.",0,0
3492113,Chronic airway obstruction in children: evaluation with cine-CT,"The radiographic diagnosis of airway lesions, especially laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia, often is imprecise. Endoscopy, which allows detailed examination of the upper airway, is an invasive procedure requiring sedation or anesthesia. A prospective study was undertaken to show the value of cine-CT (Imatron) scanning in diagnosing airway lesions in children. Eleven patients, aged 10 days to 4 years old, with a history of stridor were evaluated by both cine-CT and flexible fiberoptic endoscopy. Cine-CT studies of 12 children imaged for other reasons and without clinical evidence of airway disease served as controls to assess normal airway motion. Endoscopy identified 13 abnormalities, 11 of which were identified by cine-CT. Cine-CT has the capacity to image common causes of chronic stridor in children. It is rapid, noninvasive, and requires no sedation in most children. Although additional work is needed to clarify the role of cine-CT, this study suggests that cine-CT is a sensitive and specific imaging technique for evaluation of chronic stridor in infants and children.",0,0
21114923,Comparison of the autofluorescence bronchoscope and the white light bronchoscope in airway examination,"Background and objective: The sensitivity and accuracy of white light bronchoscopy (WLB) in airway examination are low. Autofluorescence bronchoscope (AFB) can determine early lesions in bronchial mucosa more sensitively, but it has seldom performed in China. To assess the clinical value of the AFB in airway examination, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the AFB and WLB in detecting cancer of the airway mucosa. Methods: Between September 2009 and May 2010, bronchoscope examinations using both the AFB and WLB were performed on 136 patients, 95 men and 41 women with a median age of 61.5 years (ranged from 25 to 84 years). There were 46 lesions located in the central airway, 84 in the peripheral lung parenchyma, and 6 in the mediastinal region. All patients received local and general anesthesia and were subsequently examined with the WLB and AFB in tandem. All procedures were completed safely. Abnormal visual findings were recorded, and biopsies of the affected regions were collected for pathologic examination. Results: Of 241 regions sampled for biopsy, 76 sites contained malignant lesions, whereas 165 sites contained benign lesions. The AFB detected 72 of the 76 malignant lesions, but the WLB detected only 50. The sensitivities of the AFB and WLB were 94.7% and 65.8%, respectively, and the specificities were 57.0% and 83.6%, respectively. The negative predictive values of the AFB and WLB were 95.9% and 84.1%, respectively. Conclusions: The AFB is more sensitive than the WLB in detecting cancerous lesions in the mucosa, and is an effective airway examination.",0,0
20236091,Increased levels of N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine in epithelial lining fluid from peripheral airways in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study,"It has been reported that small airway inflammation is closely associated with the severity of airflow limitation in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). We tested a new method of measurement of biochemical constituents in ELF (epithelial lining fluid) obtained separately from the central or peripheral airways using a bronchoscopic microsampling technique. The present study was designed to determine the validity of measuring CML [N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine] levels in ELF for the assessment of small airway inflammation in COPD. Ten non-smokers, ten current smokers and 16 COPD patients were included in the present study. Concentrations of CML, 8-isoprostane and IL-8 (interleukin-8) were measured in ELF separately from the central or peripheral airways. CML levels in central airways did not differ significantly, but were markedly higher in peripheral than in central airways in the three groups. However, CML levels in peripheral airways of COPD patients were significantly higher than those in non-smokers and current smokers. In COPD patients, the CML level in peripheral airways was significantly correlated with FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) (r=-0.82, P=0.002) and FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) (r=-0.57, P=0.03). Moreover, CML levels in peripheral airways were significantly correlated with levels of both 8-isoprostane (r=0.76, P=0.003) and IL-8 (r=0.67, P=0.01). In conclusion, these findings suggest that elevated levels of CML in ELF from peripheral airways were observed in COPD patients, and this parameter was correlated with the severity of airflow limitation.",0,0
26442413,[Intubation Using a Double-lumen Tube with a Combination of Fiberoptic Bronchoscope and the Glidescope in a Patient with Difficult Airway],"A 54-year-old man with lung cancer was scheduled for thoracoscopic upper lobe resection under general anesthesia. About half a year previously, he had undergone surgery for oropharyngeal cancer and tongue cancer. As a result of the surgery, elasticity of the neck skin bending of the neck were restricted (Mallampati classification IV). A narrow-bored tracheostomy tube (speech cannula) was inserted. In the operating room, the tip of a 5.0 mm ID standard tube was inserted from the tracheostomy tube, and connected to a breathing circuit. Anesthesia was induced with inhalation of sevoflurane, followed by intravenous propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium. Four anesthesiologists were required to intubate the trachea. One person held the tracheal tube placed in the tracheotomy tube. The second person performed jaw thrusting. The third person inserted the Glidescope to shift the transplanted tongue to the side. It was then possible for the forth anesthesiologist to manage to see the glottis using a fiberoptic bronchoscope, and a double-lumen tube (DLT) could be inserted to the trachea orally. Inserting a DLT over the fiberoptic bronchoscope is a blind method, but we felt that combined with a variety of tools such as video laryngoscope, the success rate in intubation will increase.",0,0
20054587,Successful use of spinal anesthesia in a patient with severe Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome associated with upper airway abnormalities and chronic Kasabach-Merritt coagulopathy,"Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the triad of capillary or cavernous hemangiomas, venous varicosities or malformations, and soft tissue or bone hypertrophy. Neuraxial anesthesia in patients with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome has been infrequently described and has not been previously reported when accompanied by consumptive coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome). The authors describe their clinical management of a 23 year-old woman with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome who presented for elective total knee arthroplasty. Her past medical history was notable for chronic Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, hypersplenism with pancytopenia, and intermittent lower gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from colonic hemangiomas. The physical examination revealed several large cavernous hemangiomas located on her right face, neck, chest, arm, and leg. No hemangiomas were noted within the dermatomal levels innervated by the upper lumbar spine. The neck hemangioma was very large and filled with blood when the patient assumed a supine position, making it almost impossible for her to breathe. The oropharynx revealed markedly hypertrophied soft tissue, pharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal hemangiomas, and a Mallampati class IV airway. Spinal and epidural hemangiomas were excluded based on a magnetic resonance imaging study before surgery. Kasabach-Merritt coagulopathy was corrected preoperatively by administration of cryoprecipitate. These interventions allowed the authors to safely perform a spinal anesthetic for the operation. The current case illustrates that major conduction anesthesia may be safely performed in patients with Klippel-Trénaunay disease provided that preoperative imaging studies exclude neurovascular involvement and coexisting coagulopathy is appropriately corrected.",0,0
24247413,Self-positioning followed by induction of anaesthesia and insertion of a laryngeal mask airway versus endotracheal intubation and subsequent positioning for spinal surgery in the prone position: a randomised clinical trial,"Background: Anaesthesia followed by positioning in the prone position takes time and may have complications. Objective: The hypothesis was that self-positioning in the prone position followed by anaesthesia and introduction of a laryngeal mask airway (LM method) would be faster with fewer complications than positioning after tracheal intubation (ET method). Design: Randomised, controlled trial. Setting: University Hospital, March 2009 to March 2011. Patients: One hundred forty patients scheduled for spinal surgery were allocated to the LM or the ET method. Exclusion criteria were surgery expected to last more than 2 h, American Society of Anesthesiologists status more than II, age more than 70 years, abnormal neck, throat, and mouth anatomy and function, Mallampati score III-IV, BMI more than 35 kg m, anticipated difficult airway/mask ventilation and decreased neck mobility. Interventions: Patients in the LM group placed themselves in the prone position, anaesthesia was induced and a laryngeal mask was introduced. Patients in the ET group were anaesthetised, intubated and then placed in the prone position. Main outcome measures: Time taken from identification of the patient at the outset to readiness for radiographic examination following anaesthesia and positioning. Airway problems, sore throat, hoarseness and pain from muscles and joints were also noted. Results: One hundred and forty patients were randomised to LM (n = 70) and ET (n = 70). Data from 64 and 67 patients were analysed. Values are expressed as median (interquartiles) [range]. The primary outcome time was 25 min (23 to 29) [16 to 44] in the LM group and 30 min (26 to 33) [17 to 47] in the ET group (P <0.001). In two patients in group LM, a complete seal could not be obtained; one was intubated, and the other had surgery cancelled due to arterial hypotension. There were fewer cases with sore throat, hoarseness and pain from muscles and joints in the LM group at 3 h, but not at 24 h postoperatively. Conclusion: Self-positioning and induction of anaesthesia in the prone position saves time. More patients should be studied to confirm safety and examine whether the method reduces the number of severe complications associated with the prone position.

22052982,The epidemiology of upper airway injury in patients undergoing major surgical procedures,"Background: Airway injury is a potentially serious and costly adverse event of anesthesia care. The epidemiologic characteristics of airway injury have not been well documented. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) is a multicenter, prospective, outcome-oriented database for patients undergoing major surgical procedures. Using the NSQIP data for the years 2005 to 2008, we examined the incidence of, and risk factors for, airway injury. Results: Of the 563,190 patients studied, 1202 (0.2%) sustained airway injury. The most common airway injury was lip laceration/hematoma (61.4%), followed by tooth injury (26.1%), tongue laceration (5.7%), pharyngeal laceration (4.7%), and laryngeal laceration (2.1%). Multivariable logistic modeling revealed an increased risk of airway injury in patients with Mallampati class III (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.69; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.11, relative to patients with Mallampati classes I and II) or class IV (adjusted OR, 2.6; 99% CI, 1.52-4.02), and in patients aged 80 years or older (adjusted OR, 1.50; 99% CI, 1.02-2.19, relative to patients aged 40 to 49 years). Conclusions: The risk of airway injury for patients undergoing major surgical procedures is approximately 1 in 500. Patients with difficult airways as indicated by Mallampati classes III and IV are at significantly increased risk of sustaining airway injury during anesthesia for major surgical procedures.",0,0
2304245,[Investigation of a patient with difficult endotracheal intubation],"Unusually difficult endotracheal intubation was encountered during anesthetic induction of a 41-year-old male, necessitating use of a bronchofiberscope. The usual pre-operative analysis had shown no problems, such as tracheal tumor or stricture. Due to difficult intubation, post-operative evaluations were made and no abnormalities were found. However, investigation of the lateral roentgenogram showed a much greater than average backward bend in the patient's trachea under the vocal cord. It is likely that the sharp bend of the trachea was responsible for difficult intubation.",0,0
16575040,Preoperative predictors of difficult intubation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Purpose: It has been speculated that the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is related to difficult intubation. However, this has not been confirmed in OSAS patients. Thus, we undertook a retrospective study to assess this relationship in patients who had undergone uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) surgery for OSAS. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was undertaken following approval from the Institutional Review Board on human studies. The data from 90 patients with a polysomnograph-confirmed diagnosis of OSAS, who had undergone UPPP surgery under general anesthesia, were used to evaluate the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the preoperative lowest arterial saturation, the occurrence of difficult intubation as assessed by the operator intubation difficulty scale score, extubation time, lowest arterial saturation in postanesthesia care unit, and length of stay in postanesthesia care unit. We compared OSAS patients with 90 age and sex-matched control patients with respect to the prevalence of difficult intubation. Results: The prevalence of difficult intubation was higher in the OSAS group than in the control group (16.7% vs 3.3%, P = 0.003). When evaluating the OSAS group according to the occurrence of difficult intubation, AHI was significantly higher in the difficult intubation subgroup (67.4 +/- 22.5 vs 49.9 +/- 28.0, P = 0.026), and patients with an AHI >or= 40 showed a significantly higher prevalence of difficult intubation. Conclusion: This study shows that the occurrence of difficult intubation can be predicted using AHI in patients who undergo UPPP surgery for OSAS.",0,0
23635477,Apple peels--a versatile biomass for water purification?,"The presence of anions such as chromate, arsenate, and arsenite in drinking water is a major health concern in many parts of the world due to their high toxicity. Removal of such anions from water using low cost biomass is an efficient and affordable treatment process. Owing to the easy availability and biodegradability, we chose to use apple peel as a substrate for our investigations. Zirconium cations were immobilized onto the apple peel surface and used for the extraction of anions. Zirconium loaded apple peels were used to extract anions such as phosphate, arsenate, arsenite, and chromate ions from aqueous solutions. The presence of Zr cations on the apple peel surface was characterized using XPS. The modified adsorbent was characterized using SEM, EDS, and FT-IR. Zr treated apple peels showed efficient adsorption toward AsO2(-) (15.64 mg/g), AsO4(3-) (15.68 mg/g), Cr2O7(2-) (25.28 mg/g), and PO4(3-) (20.35 mg/g) anions. The adsorption and desorption studies revealed the adsorption mechanism involves electrostatic interactions. Anion removal efficiency was estimated by batch adsorption studies. Adsorption kinetic parameters for all anions at different concentrations were described using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order rate equations. Langumir and Freundlich isotherms were used to validate our adsorption data. Arsenate and chromate anions were strongly adsorbed at the pH range from 2 to 6, while arsenite was extracted efficiently between pH 9 and 10. Overall, the Zr immobilized apple peel is an efficient adsorbent for common anionic pollutants.",0,0
26647534,[The related factors analysis of difficult laryngeal exposure under retaining laryngoscope],"Objective: To analyze the related factors of difficult laryngeal exposure under retaining laryngoscope. Method: We did a retrospective analysis of 287 retaining laryngoscope surgery patients' clinical datas to observe the relationship between difficult glottis exposure and patients' gender, degree of mouth opening, BMI, neck circumference, head and neck flexion, TMD, HMD and SMD. Result: By ROC curve analysis, we determine the optimal threshold for TMD was 7.35 cm, HMD was 6.33 cm, SMD was 14.75 cm. Univariate analysis showed that gender, and glottis exposure had no significant correlation with difficult laryngeal exposure under retaining laryngoscope. Degree of mouth opening, BMI, neck circumference, head and neck flexion, TMD, HMD and SMD had correlation with difficult laryngeal exposure. Multivariate analysis showed that neck circumference, head and neck flexion, TMD, SMD were independent factors of difficult laryngeal exposure under retaining laryngoscope. Conclusion: Measurement of neck circumference, head and neck flexion, TMD, SMD before the operation is important for the prediction of difficult laryngeal exposure under retaining laryngoscope.",0,0
20219687,Pharmacological validation of a telemetric model for the measurement of bronchoconstriction in conscious rats,"Introduction: Telemetric measurement of intra-pleural pressure in conscious animals that are restrained in head-out plethysmography chambers enables determination of airway resistance. Originally proposed over 10 years ago, pharmacological validation of this technique is limited. Here airway resistance in conscious, instrumented rats was compared to measurement in anaesthetised rats via a fluid filled oesophageal catheter following administration of two different pharmacological agents. Methods: Male rats were implanted with telemetry devices and were trained to accept the restraint of head-out plethysmography chambers. A separate group of male rats were anaesthetised, placed in a body-enclosed plethysmography chamber and were prepared with a tracheal, oesphageal and jugular vein cannulae. Methacholine or NECA were given intravenously and changes in ventilation and airway resistance were measured. Results: The pressure signal obtained in the telemetered rats was found to be extremely variable. Variability was confounded by excessive struggling, particularly during the infusion periods. Misplacement of the pressure sensitive catheter tip and prior habituation to the chamber were not factors in signal variability. Consequently, no dose-response relationship to either pharmacological agent was established in this model. Dose-dependent increases in resistance to both methacholine and NECA were measured in anaesthetised rats using body-enclosed plethysmography. Discussion: Given the variability of the pressure signal within and between rats, the feasibility of a model in conscious rats for the measurement of airway resistance is questioned. Improved restraint methods or alternative models in conscious animals should therefore be explored. In the meantime, assessment of airway resistance is best confined to the anaesthetised rat.",0,0
8273882,The Australian Incident Monitoring Study. Difficult intubation: an analysis of 2000 incident reports,"The first 2000 incidents reported to the Australian Incident Monitoring Study were analysed with respect to the incidence and circumstances of problems with endotracheal intubation; 85 (4%) indicated difficulties with intubation. One third of these were emergency cases, one third involved an initially unassisted trainee and one fifth were outside normal working hours. Failure to predict a difficult intubation was reported in one third of the cases, with another quarter presenting serious difficulty despite preoperative prediction. Difficulties with ventilation were experienced in 1 in 7 of the 85 reports; there was one cardiac arrest, but no death. Endotracheal intubation was not achieved in one fifth of the cases. The commonest complications reported amongst the 85 incidents were oesophageal intubation (18 cases), arterial desaturation (15 cases), and reflux of gastric contents (7 cases). Emergency trans-tracheal airways were required in 5 cases. Obesity, limited neck mobility and mouth opening, and inadequate assistance together accounted for two thirds of all the contributing factors. The most successful intubation aid in this series was a gum elastic bougie. A capnograph contributed to management in 28% and a pulse oximeter in 12% of the cases in which they were used. The most serious desaturations were associated with accidental oesophageal intubation. These data suggest a lack of reliable preoperative assessment techniques and skills for the prediction of difficult intubations. They also suggest the need for a greater emphasis on ensuring that the necessary equipment is available, and on teaching and learning drills for difficult intubation and any associated difficulty with ventilation.",0,0

We induced general anesthesia, and ventilation via facemask was adequate, but tracheal intubation using a Macintosh laryngoscope was difficult (Cormack-Lehane classification III). We inserted the i-gel, and a fiberoptic bronchoscope covered with the Aintree Intubation Catheter (AIC), was passed through the i-gel to the trachea. We removed i-gel and fiberscope, leaving the AIC in place, and could easily advance a reinforced tube over the AIC into the trachea. Fiberoptic tracheal intubation via the i-gel and AIC is useful in a patient with difficult intubation.",0,0
9615848,[First experience with the laryngeal intubation mask],"Objective: We report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach), which was designed by A.I.J. Brain to improve blind endotracheal intubation through a laryngeal mask. Methods: In the ILMA, a number of construction details were newly designed compared to a standard laryngeal mask airway (SLM): 1) the angle between the shaft and the mask plane is changed, and also the radius of the shaft, 2) the internal diameter of the shaft is increased to allow the passage of an 8.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube, resulting in an outer diameter of 2.0 cm, 3) a stable rubber lip (epiglottic elevating bar) is incorporated instead of the gills to clear the epiglottis out of the lumen during the passage of the endotracheal tube, 4) the shaft is manufactured out of stainless steel covered by silicone with a handle attached for more precise guidance. We prospectively used the ILMA in 80 patients for blind intubation. 51 had normal anatomy (group I), 19 were difficult to intubate (Cormack grade 3-4; group II), 18 had a reduced mouth opening (< or = 2.5 cm awake; group III), 8 of them also were difficult to intubate. Results: Insertion of the ILMA and ventilation was possible in all patients but one with a mouth opening of 1.3 cm during anaesthesia. 4 patients with difficult intubation and one with normal anatomy could not be ventilated with a face mask but could be ventilated with the ILMA. Blind intubation was successful in 69 out of 80 patients (global success rate 87%; group I: 84%; II: 95%; III: 83%), in 38 during the first attempt (initial success rate 48%; group I: 45%; II: 63%; III: 44%), showing no difference for patients with normal anatomy, difficult intubation or reduced mouth opening. For 82 successful intubations, 157 intubation attempts were performed (success rate per attempt 52%; group I: 48%; II: 67%; III: 54%). Success rate per attempt decreased to 42%, if intubation was not successful during the first attempt (106 intubation attempts resulting in 44 successful intubations, including 31 intubation attempts for 11 failures; group I: 35%; II: 56%; III: 38%). Intubation through the ILMA was not possible in 11 patients (14%). Failures to intubate were caused by a reduced mouth opening in 1 patient, an unsuited endotracheal tube in 1 patient, a wrong size of the ILMA may have been the cause in 6 patients, in the remaining 3, lacking personal skill may have been responsible. Endotracheal tubes suited to be used with the ILMA are straight or preformed Woodbridge tubes, whereas standard plastic tubes are too stiff. Manouvres facilitating blind intubation though the ILMA were careful alignment of the ILMA with the handle, an up and down manouvre, rotation of the tube or head movements. Conclusion: The ILMA improved ventilation compared to a face mask and almost doubled the success rate of blind intubation compared to a SLM in our hands in a variety of intubation situations. The ILMA has the potential to be useful in difficult to intubate patients--except those with cervical pathology--or in emergency medicine. Handling can be trained during every day routine. Experienced judgement of definite endotracheal tube placement is mandatory.",0,0
21037956,"Assessment of airway inflammation using sputum, BAL, and endobronchial biopsies in current and ex-smokers with established COPD","Rationale: Smoking effects on physiological and gross pathology in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are relatively well described. However, there is little known in COPD about the detailed interrelationships between lung function and inflammatory profiles in different airway compartments from the same individual and whether airway inflammation in these different compartments differs in ex- and current smokers with established COPD. Objectives: We compared sputum, bronchoalveolar (BAL), and airway wall inflammatory profiles in current versus ex-smokers and related this to smoking intensity and lung function in 17 current and 17 ex-smokers with mild to moderate COPD. Results: Current smokers had more sputum mast cells (% differential and absolute numbers), whereas ex-smokers had increased sputum neutrophils. In BAL, there was a significant increase in eosinophils in current smokers, but ex-smokers had significantly increased neutrophils, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. There were no cell profile differences observed in airway biopsies between current and ex-smokers and there were no correlations between the individual inflammatory cell populations in any of the airway compartments. In current smokers only, smoking intensity was negatively correlated with lung function, and associated with a reduction in overall cellularity of both sputum and BAL. Conclusion: Airway inflammation persists in ex-smokers with COPD, but differs from COPD current smokers. The impact of smoking appears to vary in different airway compartments and any direct relationships between cellularity and lung function tended to be negative, ie, worse lung function indicated the presence of fewer cells.",0,0
25731055,[Airway management in children with vallecular cyst: review of 25 cases--can we predict difficult intubation?],"Background: Vallecular cysts frequently cause difficult intubation due to poor glottic visualization during direct laryngoscopy. The appropriate way of airway management and predictive factors of difficult intubation are unknown. Methods: We reviewed anesthetic induction and airway management in 25 cases of vallecular cysts for the past 11 years. We collected the following data of 24 cases in 20 children who were intubated under direct laryngoscopy: age (month), height (cm), weight (kg), cyst-diameter (mm), cyst-diameter to patient-height ratio, and clinical symptoms. These data were compared between difficult intubation group (group A) and easy or slightly difficult intubation group (group B). Results: In the majority of cases, anesthesia was induced with spontaneous ventilation maintained. Group A and B consisted of 6 and 18 cases, respectively. All cases of group A required assistive devices such as stylets or tube introducers. Cyst-diameter to patient-height ratios were significantly higher in group A than in group B (0.26 vs. 0.18, P = 0.03). Conclusions: Because children with vallecular cysts have a risk of difficult airway, we need to prepare for difficult airway management. The cyst-diameter to patient-height ratio could be useful as a predictor of difficult intubation.",0,0
22818089,Enhanced heavy metal immobilization in soil by grinding with addition of nanometallic Ca/CaO dispersion mixture,"This study investigated the use of a nanometallic Ca and CaO dispersion mixture for the immobilization of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr and Pb) in contaminated soil. Simple grinding achieved 85-90% heavy metal immobilization, but it can be enhanced further to 98-100% by addition of a nanometallic Ca/CaO dispersion mixture produced by grinding. Observations using SEM-EDS elemental maps and semi-quantitative analysis showed that the amounts of As, Cd, Cr, and Pb measurable on the soil particle surface decrease after nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment. The leachable heavy metal concentrations were reduced after nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment to concentrations lower than the Japan soil elution standard regulatory threshold: <0.01 mg L(-1) for As, Cd, and Pb; and 0.05 mg L(-1) for Cr. Effects of soil moisture and pH on heavy metal immobilization were not strongly influenced. The most probable mechanisms for the enhancement of heavy metal immobilization capacity with nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment might be due to adsorption and entrapment of heavy metals into newly formed aggregates, thereby prompting aggregation of soil particles and enclosure/binding with Ca/CaO-associated immobile salts. Results suggest that the nanometallic Ca/CaO mixture is suitable for use in immobilization of heavy-metal-contaminated soil under normal moisture conditions.",0,0
24361845,The importance of subjective facial appearance on the ability of anesthesiologists to predict difficult intubation,"Background: Previously we demonstrated that a computer algorithm based on bedside airway examinations and facial photographs accurately classified easy and difficult airways. The extent of the ability of anesthesiologists to perform the same task is unknown. We hypothesized that providing photographs would add to the predictive ability of anesthesiologists over that achieved when provided only with the Mallampati (MP) score and the thyromental distance (TMD). We further hypothesized that human observers would implicitly bias their predictions toward more sensitive determination of difficult airways, rather than more specific determination of easy airways. Methods: Residents, fellows, and attending anesthesiologists with varying levels of experience (N = 160) were presented with MP and TMD information from 80 Caucasian men subjects. The same subjects' data, accompanied by 3 facial photographs in head-on and right and left profiles, were also presented. Anesthesiologists classified the airways as easy or difficult according to specified criteria (""easy"" defined as a single attempt with a Macintosh 3 blade resulting in a grade 1 laryngoscopic view; ""difficult"" defined as >1 attempt by an operator with at least 12 months anesthesia experience, grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view, need for a second operator, or nonelective use of an alternative airway device). Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for each anesthesiologist. We further developed a cost function to quantify a relative bias toward avoiding an unexpectedly difficult intubation versus overpreparing for an easy intubation. Results: One hundred sixty respondents completed the study. Presenting photographs improved respondents' sensitivity and accuracy in classifying airways, though specificity decreased slightly. Overall accuracy when given photographs was 61.6% (95% confidence interval, 60.8%-62.4%), which was significantly lower than the computer's performance of 87.5% (t test, P < 0.0001). Presentation of photographs, compared with MP and TMD alone, caused anesthesiologists to change their prediction from easy to difficult more frequently if the patients were obese (weight or body mass index), despite not having data on weight or height available. The cost function demonstrated that anesthesiologists strongly preferred to enhance sensitivity (detecting difficult airways) as compared with specificity (detecting easy airways), with a ratio of 6.5:1 (95% confidence interval, 4.9:1-8.4:1). Conclusions: Anesthesiologists can derive useful information from facial appearance that enhances the prediction of a difficult airway over that achieved when presented with MP and TMD data alone. Anesthesiologists implicitly bias their predictions toward detection of difficult airways, compared with the true incidence of difficult airways, at the expense of accuracy and specificity. This behavior may be rational for cognitive tasks in which the costs of failure are strongly asymmetric.",0,0
15599146,Achieving house staff competence in emergency airway management: results of a teaching program using a computerized patient simulator,"Objectives: Patient simulation is emerging as a training technique in the field of medicine. It has particular application in training responses to high-risk, low-frequency clinical events, of which a typical example is in-hospital cardiac arrest. A critical element of response by the cardiac arrest team is initial airway management. In teaching hospitals, medical interns are first responders to in-hospital cardiac arrests. Our objective was to design and test a program using a computer-controlled patient simulator to train medical interns and demonstrate their competence in initial airway management. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded trial. Setting: Internal medicine residency training program in an urban teaching hospital. Participants: All 50 starting internal medicine interns in July 2002, all Advanced Cardiac Life Support certified in June 2002. Interventions: All interns were tested in initial airway management skills and then were randomly assigned to receive either immediate or delayed individualized training using a computer-controlled patient simulator. The computer-simulated training process consisted of a scenario of respiratory arrest. The interns were challenged with the scenario twice following testing. The interns were debriefed extensively and given hands-on training by the attending using the simulator until they achieved perfect performance. Measurements and main results: Initial airway management was divided into specific scorable steps. Individual step scores and total scores were recorded for each intern on initial and repeat testing. For 10 months following simulator training, intern airway management skills were scored in actual patient airway events. Despite recent Advanced Cardiac Life Support training and certification, all starting medical interns demonstrated poor airway management skills. The immediate training group showed significant improvement in initial airway management when tested before and 4 wks after training. In contrast, the delayed training group showed no significant improvement. Direct observation of interns in actual initial airway events revealed excellent clinical performance. Conclusions: Individualized training of medical interns using a computer-controlled patient simulator is an effective means of achieving and measuring competence in initial airway management skills. The improvement appears to be transferable to the bedside of real patients.",0,0
8391964,The role of staging bronchoscopy in the preoperative assessment of a solitary pulmonary nodule,"In order to assess the role of a staging fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the preoperative assessment of an indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN), we reviewed our experience in 33 SPNs identified among 1,269 bronchoscopies performed at the Albert Einstein Medical Center between 1985 and 1989. All lesions were less than 4 cm in greatest diameter and were not associated with symptoms of weight loss, chest pain, hemoptysis, localized wheezing, or hoarseness. A tissue diagnosis was established in 25 patients, 23 of whom had a malignant SPN. This study failed to detect a single case in which a fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination of the airway discovered a lesion that would preclude surgery and potentially curative resection. We recommend the abandonment of a staging bronchoscopy in the evaluation of a patient with an indeterminant SPN in whom history, physical examination, laboratory, and imaging studies fail to document contraindications to surgery. No additional useful information is derived and a substantial cost savings to the patient can be realized if the procedure is eliminated.",0,0
24130949,"Sensitivity of palm print, modified mallampati score and 3-3-2 rule in prediction of difficult intubation","Background: This study evaluated the performance of modified Mallampati score, 3-3-2 rule and palm print in prediction of difficult intubation. Methods: In a prospective descriptive study, data from 500 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were collected. An anesthesiologist evaluated the airway using mentioned tests and another anesthesiologist evaluated difficult intubation. Laryngoscopic views were determined by Cormack and Lehane score. Grades 3 and 4 were defined as difficult intubation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and Youden index were determined for all tests. Results: Difficult intubation was reported in 8.9% of the patients. There was a significant correlation between body mass index and difficult intubation (P : 0.004); however, other demographic characteristics didn't have a significant correlation with difficult intubation. Among three tests, palm print was of highest specificity (96.46%) and modified Mallampati of highest sensitivity (98.40%). In a combination of the tests, the highest specificity, sensitivity and Youden index were observed when using all three tests together. Conclusions: Palm print has a high specificity for prediction of difficult intubation, but the best way for prediction of difficult intubation is using all three tests together.",0,0
19095848,Forces applied to the maxillary incisors during video-assisted intubation,"Background: Modern, video laryngoscopes provide an easier view of the glottis, possibly facilitating easier intubations. We describe an objective method for evaluating the benefits of video-assisted laryngoscopy, compared with standard techniques using force measurements. Method: Macintosh and video laryngoscopes (both Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) were used on the patients until the anesthesiologist was convinced he or she had the best possible view of the glottis. Actual intubation was only performed with the second of the laryngoscopes. Sensors measured the forces directly applied to the patients' maxillary incisors. Additionally, common subjective pre- (e.g., Mallampati) and intraintubation (e.g., Cormack-Lehane [C&L]) metrics of intubation difficulty were evaluated by the anesthesiologists. Results: All patients (24 female, [50 +/- 16 yr], 20 male [56 +/- 13 yr]) included in the study were successfully intubated with both the classic and video laryngoscopes. The forces recorded for the classic Macintosh blade ranged from 0 to 87.4 N with a median of 15.3 N, whereas the video laryngoscope forces ranged from 0 to 45.2 N, with a median of 2.1 N. The only factor determined to be significantly influential on the associated forces applied to the maxillary incisors was the laryngoscope type (P < 0.01). Video-assisted laryngoscopes reduced the applied forces over standard blades. Mallampati and C&L grade were not predictive of the forces applied. Conclusions: Video-assisted laryngoscopes seem beneficial when considering forces applied to the maxillary incisors as an objective metric of intubation difficulty. In this study, we could not support that Mallampati and C&L grades predict the forces that are applied to the maxillary incisors.",0,0
27006541,Airway management and postoperative length of hospital stay in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery,"Background and aims: General anesthesia and airway management of patients for head and neck cancer surgery is a challenge for the anesthesiologist. Appropriate assessment and planning are essential for successful airway management. Our objectives were to review airway management strategies in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery in our tertiary care institution and also to observe the effect of airway management techniques on postoperative length of hospital stay (PLOS). Material and methods: A retrospective medical record review of 400 patients who underwent major head and neck cancer surgery in our institution was conducted. A special form was used, and records were searched for airway and anesthetic management in the operating room and recovery room, and for PLOS. Results: 289 (72.25%) of the patients were male, and 111 (27.75%) female. 49.8% of patients had Mallampati score of 3 and 4. Airway was managed with tracheostomy in 81 (20.25%) patients; nasal intubation was performed in 177 (44.25%) and oral intubation in 142 (35.5%) patients. Postoperative emergency tracheostomy was not done in any of the patients. Conclusion: Median postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer (P = 0.0005) in patients who had a tracheostomy performed compared with those where the airway was managed without it.",0,0
1411665,Difficult intubation: a prospective study,Difficult intubation has been much discussed in the anaesthetic literature. The incidence of difficult intubation (11:560) was higher in obstetric patients (6:277) as compared to gynaecological patients (5:283) in our hospital. We tested the Mallampati's classification as a predictor of difficult intubation in 277 obstetric and 283 gynaecological patients. We recommend that Mallampati's classification can be used reliably (p less than 0.05) to predict difficult intubation in obstetric but not in gynaecological patients.,0,0
25206313,A modified technique to improve the outcome of intubation with a left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube,"Background: The use of a video-assisted laryngoscope (VL) has been shown to reduce the time to achieve intubation with a double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT). As the blade of the VL is curved differently to a standard laryngoscope, the DLT must be angled into a hockey stick shape to fit properly. We conducted a study to establish which direction of angulation was best to facilitate correct positioning of the DLT when using a VL. Methods: We enrolled patients scheduled for thoracic surgery who required intubation with a DLT. They were prospectively randomized into one of two groups: those intubated with a DLT angled to conceal the tracheal orifice (the tracheal orifice-covered, TOC) group or the tracheal orifice-exposed (TOE) group. The composite primary outcome measures were time taken to intubate and the frequency of first-time success. The time taken to intubate was divided into: T1, the time from mouth opening to visualization of the vocal cords with the VL; and T2, the time taken to advance the DLT through the cords until its tip lay within the trachea and three carbon dioxide waveforms had been detected by capnography. The hemodynamic responses to intubation and intubation-related adverse events were also recorded. Results: Sixty-six patients completed the study, with 33 in each group. Total intubation time was significantly shorter in the TOC group (mean 30.6 ± standard deviation 2.7 seconds versus 38.7 ± 3.3 seconds, p <0.0001). T2 was also significantly shorter in the TOC group than the TOE group (27.2 ± 2.5 seconds versus 34.9 ± 3.0 seconds, p <0.0001). The severity of hoarseness on the first postoperative day and sore throat on the fourth postoperative day were significantly lower in the TOC group than the TOE group (p = 0.02 and <0.0001, respectively). The hemodynamic responses to intubation were broadly similar between the groups. Conclusion: When placing a left-sided DLT using a VL, angling the bronchial lumen to a hockey stick shape that conceals the tracheal lumen saves time and ameliorates the severity of post-intubation complications.

11976844,New frontiers in CT imaging of airway disease,"Combining helical volumetric CT acquisition and thin-slice thickness during breath hold provides an accurate assessment of both focal and diffuse airway diseases. With multiple detector rows, compared with single-slice helical CT, multislice CT can cover a greater volume, during a simple breath hold, and with better longitudinal and in-plane spatial resolution and improved temporal resolution. The result in data set allows the generation of superior multiplanar and 3D images of the airways, including those obtained from techniques developed specifically for airway imaging, such as virtual bronchography and virtual bronchoscopy. Complementary CT evaluation at suspended or continuous full expiration is mandatory to detect air trapping that is a key finding for depicting an obstruction on the small airways. Indications for CT evaluation of the airways include: (a) detection of endobronchial lesions in patients with an unexplained hemoptysis; (b) evaluation of extent of tracheobronchial stenosis for planning treatment and follow-up; (c) detection of congenital airway anomalies revealed by hemoptysis or recurrent infection; (d) detection of postinfectious or postoperative airway fistula or dehiscence; and (e) diagnosis and assessment of extent of bronchiectasis and small airway disease. Improvement in image analysis technique and the use of spirometrically control of lung volume acquisition have made possible accurate and reproducible quantitative assessment of airway wall and lumen areas and lung density. This contributes to better insights in physiopathology of obstructive lung disease, particularly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.",0,0
25866708,Hemodynamic changes following endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing cesarean section with general anesthesia: application of glidescope® videolaryngoscope versus direct laryngoscope,"Background: Endotracheal intubation is usually associated with hemodynamic changes, especially in patients undergoing cesarean section by general anesthesia. GlideScope® videolaryngoscope (GVL) is a novel video laryngoscope, which does not need direct exposure of vocal cords and produces lesser hemodynamic changes due to lower degrees of trauma and stimuli to oropharynx than the Macintosh direct laryngoscope (MDL). Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare hemodynamic changes following endotracheal intubation with GVL and MDL in patients undergoing cesarean section by general anesthesia. Materials and methods: Seventy patients undergoing elective cesarean section by general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were randomly allocated to be intubated with either GVL (n = 35) or MDL (n = 35). Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), as well as pulse rates, and rate pressure product (RPP) were compared at baseline, after induction of anesthesia, and after intubation at one-minute interval for five minutes between the two groups. The patients were also compared for Mallampati score, sore throat, intubation time and neonates' Apgar scores. Results: The patients were similar regarding systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Pulse rate changes were significantly lower only at 1 and 3 minutes in the GVL group. The intubation times were 9.3 ± 1.4 and 10.6 ± 1.7 seconds in the MDL and GVL groups, respectively (P > 0.05). RPP was also lower in the GVL group at 1 and 2 minutes (P < 0.05) and returned to baseline afterwards. There was no significant difference between the groups for Mallampati score, sore throat and Apgar scores. Conclusions: Our study revealed that hemodynamic parameters with GVL are only better preserved in the first three minutes after intubation in patients undergoing elective cesarean section and patients are similar regarding intubation time, sore throat and Apgar score.",0,0
19301414,Pharyngeal morphology: a determinant of successful nasal surgery for sleep apnea,"Objectives/hypothesis: To estimate the effectiveness of nasal surgery on the occurrence of sleep apnea, and to analyze the pharyngeal morphology of apnea patients whose sleep-disordered breathing was ameliorated postoperatively. Study design: Prospective study. Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients with apnea and nasal obstruction underwent polysomnography and a morphological examination of the upper airway before and after nasal surgery, which included septoplasty, inferior turbinectomy, and/or functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Results: Sleep apnea was significantly ameliorated in only eight patients. The postoperative reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index tended to be lower in those with a low-positioned soft palate, reflected in an elevated modified Mallampati score, and a narrow retroglossal space. Neither swollen tonsils nor narrow fauces affected the surgical outcome. Regression analysis showed that the modified Mallampati score (P < .05) and the retroglossal space (P < .05) were significant predictors of postoperative improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index. Conclusions: Among sleep apnea patients suffering from nasal obstruction, nasal surgery is effective in those with a high-positioned soft palate and/or a wide retroglossal space.",0,0
19923511,A visual stethoscope to detect the position of the tracheal tube,"Background: Advancing a tracheal tube into the bronchus produces unilateral breath sounds. We created a Visual Stethoscope that allows real-time fast Fourier transformation of the sound signal and 3-dimensional (frequency-amplitude-time) color rendering of the results on a personal computer with simultaneous processing of 2 individual sound signals. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Visual Stethoscope can detect bronchial intubation in comparison with auscultation. Methods: After induction of general anesthesia, the trachea was intubated with a tracheal tube. The distance from the incisors to the carina was measured using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. While the anesthesiologist advanced the tracheal tube from the trachea to the bronchus, another anesthesiologist auscultated breath sounds to detect changes of the breath sounds and/or disappearance of bilateral breath sounds for every 1 cm that the tracheal tube was advanced. Two precordial stethoscopes placed at the left and right sides of the chest were used to record breath sounds simultaneously. Subsequently, at a later date, we randomly entered the recorded breath sounds into the Visual Stethoscope. The same anesthesiologist observed the visualized breath sounds on the personal computer screen processed by the Visual Stethoscope to examine changes of breath sounds and/or disappearance of bilateral breath sound. We compared the decision made based on auscultation with that made based on the results of the visualized breath sounds using the Visual Stethoscope. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled in the study. When irregular breath sounds were auscultated, the tip of the tracheal tube was located at 0.6 +/- 1.2 cm on the bronchial side of the carina. Using the Visual Stethoscope, when there were any changes of the shape of the visualized breath sound, the tube was located at 0.4 +/- 0.8 cm on the tracheal side of the carina (P < 0.01). When unilateral breath sounds were auscultated, the tube was located at 2.6 +/- 1.2 cm on the bronchial side of the carina. The tube was also located at 2.3 +/- 1.0 cm on the bronchial side of the carina when a unilateral shape of visualized breath sounds was obtained using the Visual Stethoscope (not significant). Conclusions: During advancement of the tracheal tube, alterations of the shape of the visualized breath sounds using the Visual Stethoscope appeared before the changes of the breath sounds were detected by auscultation. Bilateral breath sounds disappeared when the tip of the tracheal tube was advanced beyond the carina in both groups.",0,0

24180160,Airtraq optical laryngoscope: advantages and disadvantages,"Difficult or unsuccesful tracheal intubation is one of the important causes for morbidity and mortality in susceptible patients. Almost 30% of the anesthesia-related deaths are induced by the complications of difficult airway management and more than 85% of all respiratory related complications cause brain injury or death. Nowadays, due to the advances in technology, new videolaryngoscopic devices became available. Airtraq is a novel single-use laryngoscope which provides glottis display without any deviation in the normal position of the oral, pharyngeal or the tracheal axes. With the help of the display lens glottis and the surrounding structures are visualised and under direct view of its tip the tracheal tube is introduced between the vocal cords. In patients having restricted neck motion or limited mouth opening (provided that it is greater than 3 cm) Airtraq offers the advantage of a better display. Moreover the video image can be transfered to an external monitor thus an experienced specialist can provide assistance and an educational course can be conducted simultaneously. On the other hand the Airtraq videolaryngoscopic devices possess certain disadvantages including the need of experience and the time demand for the operator to learn how to use them properly, the rapid deterioration of their display in the presence of a swelling or a secretion and the fact that they are rather complicated and expensive devices. The Airtraq device has already documented benefits in the management of difficult airways, however serial utilization obviously necessitates experience.",0,0
25199336,[Comparative study of the KingVision videolaryngoscope and Airwayscope using manikins],"Background: KingVision (KV) is a new videolaryngoscope. In this study, we compared the ease of use of the KV with the Airwayscope (AWS) by experienced personnel in a simulated manikin. Methods: Twenty-eight anesthesiologists participated in this study. We used an advanced patient simulator (AIRSIM) to simulate normal manikin and difficult airway scenarios including cervical spine rigidity and limited mouth opening. We compared the time required for visualization of the glottis (Tv) and tracheal intubation (Ti), and analyzed the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score and the success rates for tracheal intubation. Results: In normal manikin, the Tv and Ti with the KV were significantly shorter than with the AWS (P < 0.05). The POGO score with the KV was higher than with the AWS (P < 0.05). In difficult airway scenarios including both cervical spine rigidity and limited mouth opening, the Tv and Ti with the KV were shorter than with only the AWS (P < 0.05). There is not much difference between KV and AWS regarding the POGO score in difficult airway. Conclusions: KV may be a suitable device for routine anesthesia care and difficult airway intubation. Further studies in a clinical setting are necessary to confirm these findings.",0,0
14982570,"Anaesthesiological airway management in Denmark: assessment, equipment and documentation","Background: Failed intubation remains one cause of anaesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. In a recent survey in Denmark, 20% of respondents reported preventable mishaps in airway management. Methods: Assessment of the airway, and its documentation, as well as the availability of various equipment to manage a difficult airway, and the existence of a failed intubation plan were surveyed by mailing a questionnaire to the clinical directors of all 69 anaesthesia departments in Denmark. Results: Fifty-six departments (81%) returned the questionnaire. Pre-operative airway evaluation is performed in 90% of the departments. The tests included the mouth-opening test (77%), Mallampati score (48%), lower jaw protrusion (34%), neck mobility (63%), the measurement of the thyromental (11%) and sternomental distance (4%). The result of the tests are documented by 38% of the departments in the anaesthetic chart (96%), in the record (54%), on a card given to the patient (23%), in a letter sent to the patient's general practitioner (2%) or in a database (13%). The patients are personally informed in 82% of the departments. Only 54% of the departments have a failed intubation plan readily available. Conclusion: The preoperative assessment of the airways and its documentation is still unsatisfactory, as is communicating with the patient after a case of a difficult/impossible intubation. The adoption of internationally recognized recommendations might improve airway management and teaching to the best standard possible in the already well-equipped Danish anaesthetic departments.",0,0
12553386,Prediction of difficult tracheal intubation,"Background and objective: Preoperative bedside screening tests for difficult tracheal intubation may be neither sensitive nor specific enough for clinical use. The aim was to investigate if a combination of the Mallampati classification of the oropharyngeal view with either the thyromental or sternomental distance measurement improved the predictive value. Methods: A total of 212 (109 male, 103 female) non-obstetric surgical patients, aged >18 yr, undergoing elective surgical procedures requiring tracheal intubation were assessed preoperatively with respect to the oropharyngeal (modified Mallampati) classification, thyromental and sternomental distances. An experienced anaesthetist, blinded to the preoperative airway assessment, performed laryngoscopy and graded the view according to Cormack and Lehane's classification. Results: Twenty tracheal intubations (9%) were difficult as defined by a Cormack and Lehane Grade 3 or 4, or the requirement for a bougie in patients with Cormack and Lehane Grade 2. Used alone, the Mallampati oropharyngeal view, and thyromental and sternomental distances were associated with poor sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values. Combining the Mallampati Class III or IV with either a thyromental distance <6.5cm or a sternomental distance <12.5cm decreased the sensitivity (from 40 to 25 and 20%, respectively), but maintained a negative predictive value of 93%. The specificity and positive predictive values increased from 89 and 27% respectively for Mallampati alone to 100%. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the Mallampati classification, in conjunction with measurement of the thyromental and sternomental distances, may be a useful routine screening test for preoperative prediction of difficult tracheal intubation.",0,0
26351829,Neck circumference as a predictor of difficult intubation and difficult mask ventilation in morbidly obese patients: A prospective observational study,"Background: There is conflicting evidence as to whether obesity and neck circumference are predictors of difficult intubation in the surgical population. In addition, the cut-off neck circumference related to difficult intubation has not been clearly identified. Objectives: The primary study objective was to determine whether neck circumference and obesity were predictors of difficult intubation in morbidly obese surgical patients. Secondary outcomes included difficult mask ventilation. Design: A prospective, noninterventional study. Setting: Canadian tertiary care surgical centre between October 2012 and August 2013. Patients: A total of 104 morbidly obese surgical patients (BMI ≥40 kg m(-2)) were included in the study. Eighty-eight patients were women and 16 were men. Exclusions were known difficult airway and emergency surgery. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of the study was difficult tracheal intubation. An Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) was derived using seven parameters and difficult intubation was defined as IDS of at least 5. The secondary outcome was difficult mask ventilation; mask ventilation was graded as easy or difficult (inadequate, desaturation, two-handed or impossible). Results: Univariate analyses showed that difficult intubation was associated with neck circumference, males, BMI more than 50 kg m(-2), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status and waist circumference, and difficult mask ventilation with neck circumference, males, BMI more than 50 kg m(-2) and thyromental distance. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that neck circumference more than 42 cm (P = 0.044) and BMI more than 50 kg m(-2) (P = 0.017) were independent predictors of difficult intubation. Male sex (P = 0.004) and BMI more than 50 kg m(-2) (P = 0.031) were independent predictors of difficult mask ventilation.",0,0
24625485,[Difficult for intubation in a simulator with laryngoscope with and without mirror],"Background: The mirror laryngoscope blade (Siker blade) is used often in patients with anatomical variations, because it improves the visibility of epiglottis, shortening the intubation time. The objective was to compare the degree of difficulty in intubation with Macintosh blade versus Siker blade in a simulator, among anesthesiologists and residents in training. Methods: A comparative study in 29 medical residents in training and 21 anesthesiologists was conducted. They had three attempts of 30 seconds to perform intubation with each laryngoscope in two different stages. The time and the intubation attempt, in which a successful intubation was performed, were registered. The data were processed using Statistica software, version 6. Results: there was no difference for intubation between anesthesiologists and residents. Siker blade required more number of attempts (normal airway p 〈 0.001, difficult airway p = 0.02) and longer time for intubation (normal airway p 〈 0.0001, difficult airway p = 0.003). With a greater proportion of anesthesiologists, 20 % of the sample failed the intubation with Siker blade. Conclusions: It was more difficult for anesthesiologists and residents in training the use of the Siker blade in both stages, with normal or difficult airway on a simulator.",0,0
9485978,Bilobar atelectasis after difficult tracheal intubation,"Acute intra-operative collapse of a lobe without apparent cause is rare. We report a case of transient bilobar atelectasis that developed without any apparent cause after a difficult tracheal intubation in a healthy young patient. Intrabronchial obstruction was ruled out by bronchoscopy. The bilobar atelectasis developed acutely and resolved quickly with mechanical ventilation. The characteristics of the lung collapse were atypical, suggesting either its reflex nature or acute reduction of lung volume owing to intubation-induced coughing. We present a review of the mechanisms of atelectasis.",0,0
11744655,Effect of inhaled indomethacin on distilled water-induced airway epithelial cell swelling,"We evaluated the mechanism of the anti-asthmatic effect of inhaled indomethacin (Indo) by using an animal model (guinea pigs) of airway inflammation. After being exposed to either ozone or room air at identical flow rates (5 l/min) for 2 h, guinea pigs were anesthetized, tracheostomized, and lung resistance (RL) was subsequently measured. Guinea pigs inhaled either saline or Indo (1.5 mg/ml) for 1 min before undergoing an ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) inhalation test. RL increased significantly after 10 min of UNDW inhalation in the room air and ozone groups but more so in the ozone group. This increase in RL was significantly suppressed by pretreatment with Indo. In the morphometric assessment of airway mucosa, a significant swelling of the epithelial cells after UNDW inhalation was observed in both the room air and ozone groups but especially so in the ozone group. This increase was also suppressed with Indo pretreatment. These results suggest that the increase in RL and the swelling of airway epithelial cells induced by inhaled UNDW in ozone-exposed guinea pigs was suppressed by pretreatment of inhaled Indo and that this suppression may be one of the reasons for the anti-asthmatic effect of inhaled Indo.",0,0
3621963,Translaryngeal guided intubation for difficult intubation,"Airway obstruction remains a constant problem in acute care. This is particularly true when there are anatomical or pathological abnormalities, trauma, or when repeated failed attempts at endoscopic or blind intubations have left a bloody field, preventing clear visualization of the vocal cords. Our refinement of translaryngeal guided intubation (TLI) uses a spring guidewire accompanied by a plastic sheath protector. The wire is introduced percutaneously via a cricothyroid puncture and passed cephalad into the oropharynx or nasopharynx and out through the mouth or one of the nostrils. The plastic sheath is slid over the wire into the trachea. A well-lubricated endotracheal tube is then inserted to the desired position using the plastic sheath as a stylet. This technique works very well, and we are convinced that TLI is one of the most effective emergency techniques to secure an airway. It can be performed quickly with inexpensive equipment and is a promising addition to the currently recommended alternatives.",0,0
10050224,Prevalence and prediction of difficult intubation in Chinese women,"We conducted a prospective, blind observational study to investigate the prevalence and prediction of difficult intubation in Chinese women. Two groups of Chinese women were studied (151 pregnant and 260 non-pregnant). The prevalence of difficult intubation was 1.99% in the pregnant and 1.54% in the non-pregnant group. The difference was not statistically significant. Predictive variables for difficult intubation, including modified Mallampati class, thyromental distance and atlanto-occipital extension, had high sensitivity but low positive predictive value when used alone. A shorter thyromental distance had to be used as the criterion for prediction in Chinese women. Combination of predictive variables could improve the positive predictive value.",1,1
3592174,Difficult tracheal intubation: a retrospective study,"This is a retrospective study of patients whose tracheas were impossible to intubate on a previous occasion. There is a correlation between the degree of difficulty and the anatomy of the oropharynx in the same patient. The study was initially on obstetric patients but was extended to nonobstetric surgical patients in order to increase the number of cases investigated. The incidence of failed intubations in the obstetric group over a 3-year period was seven out of 1980 cases, whereas in the surgical group the results were six out of 13,380 patients. Any screening test which adds to our ability to predict difficulty in intubation must be welcomed, as failure to intubate can potentially lead to fatality.",0,0
24695080,Training induces cognitive bias: the case of a simulation-based emergency airway curriculum,"Introduction: Training-induced cognitive bias may affect performance. Using a simulation-based emergency airway curriculum, we tested the hypothesis that curriculum design would induce bias and affect decision making. Methods: Twenty-three novice anesthesiology residents were randomized into 2 groups. The primary outcome measure was the initiation of supraglottic airway and cricothyroidotomy techniques in a simulated cannot-ventilate, cannot-intubate scenario during 3 evaluation sessions. Secondary outcomes were response times for device initiation. After a baseline evaluation and didactic lecture, residents received an initial practical training in either surgical cricothyroidotomy (CRIC group) or supraglottic airway (SGA group). After the midtest, the groups switched to receive the alternate training. Results: From baseline to midtest, the SGA group increased initiation of supraglottic airway but not cricothyroidotomy. The CRIC group increased initiation of cricothyroidotomy but not supraglottic airway. After completion of training in both techniques, the SGA group increased initiation of both supraglottic airway and cricothyroidotomy. In contrast, the CRIC group increased initiation of cricothyroidotomy but failed to change practice in supraglottic airway. Final test response times showed that the CRIC group was slower to initiate supraglottic airway and faster to initiate cricothyroidotomy. Discussion: Practical training in only 1 technique caused bias in both groups despite a preceding didactic lecture. The chief finding was an asymmetrical effect of training sequence even after training in both techniques. Initial training in cricothyroidotomy caused bias that did not correct despite subsequent supraglottic airway training. Educators must be alert to the risk of inducing cognitive bias when designing curricula.",0,0

26495289,Comparison of five 2nd-generation supraglottic airway devices for airway management performed by novice military operators,"Objectives: Five different second-generation supraglottic airway devices, ProSeal LMA, Supreme LMA, i-gel, SLIPA, and Laryngeal Tube Suction-D, were studied. Operators were inexperienced users with a military background, combat lifesavers, nurses, and physicians. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. Devices were inserted in the operating room in low light conditions after induction of general anesthesia. Primary outcome was successful insertion on the first attempt while secondary aims were insertion time, number of attempts, oropharyngeal seal pressure, ease of insertion, fibre optic position of device, efficacy of ventilation, and intraoperative trauma or regurgitation of gastric contents. Results: In total, 505 patients were studied. First-attempt insertion success rate was higher in the Supreme LMA (96%), i-gel (87.9%), and ProSeal LMA (85.9%) groups than in the Laryngeal Tube Suction-D (80.6%) and SLIPA (69.4%) groups. Insertion time was shortest in the Supreme LMA (70.4 ± 32.5 s) and i-gel (74.4 ± 41.1 s) groups (p < 0.001). Oropharyngeal seal pressures were higher in the Laryngeal Tube Suction-D and ProSeal LMA groups than in other three devices. Conclusions: Most study parameters for the Supreme LMA and i-gel were found to be superior to the other three tested supraglottic airway devices when inserted by novice military operators.",0,0
21354999,Neck circumference to thyromental distance ratio: a new predictor of difficult intubation in obese patients,"Background: This study was performed to assess whether intubation is more difficult in obese patients and to assess the ability of a new index: the ratio of the neck circumference to thyromental distance (NC/TM), to predict difficult intubation in obese patients. Methods: The incidence of difficult tracheal intubation in 123 obese (BMI≥27.5 kg m(-2)) and 125 non-obese patients was compared. Difficult intubation was determined using the intubation difficulty scale (IDS≥5). The NC/TM ratio was calculated and its ability to predict difficult intubation in obese patients was compared with that of established predictors including high BMI, the Mallampati score, the Wilson score, NC, width of mouth opening, sternomental distance, TM, and a previous history of difficult intubation. Results: Difficult intubation was more frequent in obese patients than in non-obese patients (13.8% vs 4.8%; P=0.016). Multivariate analysis revealed that the Mallampati score, the Wilson score, and NC/TM independently predicted difficult intubation in obese patients. Among these three indices, NC/TM showed the highest sensitivity and a negative predictive value, and largest area under the curve on an ROC curve. Conclusions: Difficult intubation was more common in obese patients and the NC/TM was a better method for predicting difficult intubation than other established indices.",0,0
6711773,[Indications for tracheotomy in long-term ventilated critically ill patients],"In order to evaluate the frequency and indication of tracheotomy in long-term ventilated critically ill patients we analysed retrospectively patients requiring artificial ventilation for periods of more than 7 days. During 1974-75 30 out of 55 of these patients were tracheotomised. In accordance with common practice, early tracheotomy (14 patients) was performed when ventilatory support was expected to exceed 8 to 10 days. In another 16 cases, the same limits were applicable for terminating prolonged tracheal intubation in favour of tracheotomy. In contrast, during the period 1980-81 tracheotomy had been indicated in 8 out of 94 patients. Early tracheotomy was limited to four patients with severe facial injuries accompanied by acute lung failure. The decision to perform tracheotomy or to continue prolonged tracheal intubation was based on definite findings during direct laryngoscopy and fibre bronchoscopy examination of the airways. No late laryngeal sequelae after prolonged tracheal intubation were observed. The risks have been reduced by the use of recently introduced tube materials. Prolonged tracheal intubation has become a safe alternative to tracheotomy.",0,0

The laryngeal mask has many advantages compared to endotracheal intubation in patients suffering from craniofacial abnormalities i.e. hypoplasia of the mandibular bone and ventral position of the larynx. In these cases the laryngeal mask is easily placed. However, the facilities of fibreoptic bronchoscopy should be readily available. The physician should have gained confidence in using a laryngeal mask before employing this device in cases of difficult intubation.",0,0
17336756,Esophageal overtube facilitation of transesophageal echocardiography in patients with previously difficult esophageal intubation,"Background: In upper endoscopy, overtubes protect the hypopharynx and esophagus in patients requiring multiple esophageal intubations. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used in general cardiology practice to provide high-resolution, real-time images of cardiac structures that are often not visualized by transthoracic imaging alone. Patients with a history of esophageal disorders or difficult esophageal intubations may have increased risk for complications from the echoprobe. An esophageal overtube may facilitate TEE in such patients. Objective: We sought to evaluate the usefulness of upper endoscopy with placement of an esophageal overtube to facilitate TEE in patients with prior difficult esophageal intubations. Methods: We performed upper endoscopy, followed by placement of an esophageal overtube, in 4 patients who had an unsuccessful intubation with the TEE probe. The endoscopic procedures were successfully completed, thus, allowing for uneventful subsequent TEE. Conclusions: Upper endoscopy with placement of an esophageal overtube may allow for safe successful completion of TEE in patients with previously unsuccessful blind esophageal intubation.",0,0

Methods: Retrospective analysis of 3 patients with difficult laryngeal exposure treated with TORS. All 3 cases failed to be managed by conventional TLM after repeated attempts by experienced surgeons. In 2 cases, the initial disease was laryngeal cancer treated by a cricohyoidoepiglottopexy, with an obstructing residual epiglottis. The last case was a bilateral Reinke disease submitted to repeated TLM procedures, producing multiple supraglottic and glottic scars. In all cases, the difficult exposure was produced by a combination of concurrent elements including insufficient mouth opening, short and stiff neck, macroglossia and high-positioned larynx. Results: Two patients were exposed by means of a Davis Meyer mouth gag. The other patient was managed by a Feyh-Kastenbauer device. The key of the success was the possibility to work 'around the corner' (30° angle view) where straight alignment of the larynx was impossible. Conclusions: Where possible, a TORS approach should be considered complementary to TLM in cases of very difficult or even impossible conventional transoral laryngoscopic approach.",0,0
24034199,Epiglottic abscess causing acute airway obstruction in an adult,"Acute epiglottitis is an acute inflammation in the supraglottic region of the oropharynx which is a potentially life-threatening condition leading to rapid upper airway obstruction. An infrequent sequel of acute epiglottitis is the epiglottic abscess. Less than 50 cases have been reported in the international literature and even less are the cases that acute surgical intervention was necessary to secure the airway. We report a young man with sudden onset of odynophagia, dysphonia and dyspnea and rapidly progression of upper airway obstruction. Clinical examination with fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscope in emergency department demonstrated an epiglottic abscess. An urgent tracheostomy was performed in order to secure patient's airway and afterward, the patient underwent direct laryngoscopy and drainage of abscess and intravenous antibiotics were administrated. The diagnosis of epiglottic abscess should be considered in adult patients with odynophagia and dysphonia. Principles of treatment include aggressive airway management, surgical drainage of abscess and intravenous antibiotics.",0,0
17124848,"Intravenous and intratracheal administration of trimetoquinol, a fast-acting short-lived bronchodilator in horses with 'heaves'","Reason for performing study: Trimetoquinol (TMQ) is a potent beta-adrenoceptor agonist bronchodilator used in human medicine but has not been evaluated for potential use as a therapeutic agent for horses with 'heaves'. Objectives: To assess the pharmacodynamics of TMQ in horses with 'heaves' to determine potential therapeutic effects. Methods: Increasing doses of TMQ were administered to horses with 'heaves' by i.v. and intratracheal (i.t.) routes. Doses ranged 0.001-0.2 microg/kg bwt i.v. and 0.01-2 microg/kg bwt i.t. Cardiac and airways effects were assessed by measurement of heart rate (HR) and maximal change in pleural pressure (deltaPplmax), respectively. Side effects of sweating, agitation and muscle trembling were scored subjectively. Duration of action to i.v. (0.2 microg/kg bwt) and i.t. (2 microg/kg bwt) TMQ was evaluated over 6 h. Results: Intravenous TMQ was an exceptionally potent cardiac stimulant. Heart rate increased at 0.01 microg/kg bwt, and was still increasing after administration of highest dose, 0.2 microg/kg bwt. Airway bronchodilation, measured as a decrease in deltaPplmax, also commenced at 0.01 microg/kg bwt. By the i.t. route, TMQ was 50-100-fold less potent than by i.v. Side effects included sweating, agitation and muscle trembling. Overall, the onset of HR and bronchodilator effects was rapid, within about 3 min, but effects were over at 2 h. Conclusion: When administered i.v. and i.t., TMQ is a highly potent cardiac stimulant and a modest bronchodilator. It may not be an appropriate pharmacological agent by i.v. and i.t. routes for the alleviation of signs in horses with 'heaves'. Further studies of TMQ by oral and aerosol routes are necessary. Potential relevance: In horses, TMQ is a fast-acting bronchodilator with a short duration of action. It could be used as a rescue agent during an episode of 'heaves'. The i.v. and i.t. administration of TMQ is associated with side effects, similar to those reported for all other beta-agonists. However, other routes, such as aerosol and oral, may prove useful and safe for the alleviation of bronchoconstriction typical of 'heaves'.",0,0
9621995,Quantitative bronchoscopic assessment of airway collapsibility in newborn lamb tracheae,"To date, quantitative studies of the inherent characteristics of the developing airway wall have required excision of an airway segment or surgical creation of an isolated segment. We hypothesized that airway wall characteristics, at various collapsing pressures, and attendant changes in stiffness after smooth muscle stimulation could be quantitated bronchoscopically from airway pressure-area relationships. Neonatal lamb tracheal segments (n = 12) were suspended over hollow mounts, in a buffer-filled chamber, and subjected to a range (0 to -4.0 kPa) of pressures to determine wall stiffness under collapsing forces before and after stimulation of the trachealis with methacholine. Luminal images were recorded through a 3.6-mm flexible bronchoscope under the same conditions, subsequently corrected for distortion, and a cross-sectional area was quantitated. Both pressure-volume and pressure-area relationships detected significant changes in airway wall stiffness after methacholine administration (p < 0.002), and the magnitude of change was similar between methods. These data suggest that quantitative flexible bronchoscopy can be used clinically in the intact airway to assess wall stiffness.",0,0
8437367,[Congenital oropharyngeal wall stenosis: a case of difficult endotracheal intubation],"We experienced a case of difficult endotracheal intubation. The patient was a 43 year-old female with congenital oropharyngeal wall stenosis. She was suffering from fibromyoma of uterus and an operation was scheduled under general anesthesia. Her natural voice was nasal. She denied having any respiratory difficulty or difficulty in swallowing. Respiratory function test revealed a low peak flow but the other data were normal. Preceding endotracheal intubation, at laryngoscopy we noticed a stenosis of upper airway because of the web, extending from the middle pharynx to soft palate and its diameter was about 1 cm. Ordinary endotracheal intubation was impossible because of the stenosis. In this case, fortunately we succeeded fiberoptic endotracheal intubation under spontaneous respiration. We conclude that the examination of the pharynx is very important during the perioperative period.",0,0
8669573,Analysis of 1500 laryngeal mask uses by one anaesthetist in adults undergoing routine anaesthesia,"An analysis of 1500 laryngeal mask airway uses by one anaesthetist using the standard insertion technique was conducted to determine successful insertion rates, position by fibreoptic larynoscopy, complication rates and whether there is a long-term learning curve. The correlation between laryngeal mask airway placement and modified Mallampati grade was also determined. The first time insertion rate was 95.5% with an overall failure rate after three attempts of 0.4%. One hundred and fifteen patients were Mallampati III or IV. All failed placements were Mallampati I or II. Problems occurred in 94 patients (6.27%), but oxygen saturation decreased below 90% on only ten occasions and below 80% on one occasion. There were no episodes of regurgitation. The vocal cords were visible from the mask aperture bars in 97.1%. Comparison of insertion rates, fibreoptic position and complications for the first and second 750 insertions provides evidence for a 'long' term learning curve. These data could be used as a guide for 'optimal' or expected successful laryngeal mask airway insertion rates in adults undergoing routine anaesthesia.",0,0
15890218,Establishing learning curves for surgical residents using Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) Analysis,"Background: The assessment of technical proficiency is of paramount importance in the training of surgical residents. The fact that technical proficiency is underrepresented in the context of the ACGME outcomes project is evidenced in that proficiency skills comprise less than 5% of all assessments that evaluate residents. In this study, we use Cumulative Summation Analysis (CUSUM) as a visual objective analytic tool to determine performance accuracy and establish learning curves for PGY-1s in surgery. Methods: From April 2001 to May 2002, 11 surgical residents completed a 1-month anesthesia rotation. Each resident was asked to complete a preoperative airway assessment followed by endotracheal intubation with induction of anesthesia. Airway assessment was performed independently by a resident and a licensed anesthesiologist or certified anesthetist with the modified Mallampati Score. Data were sequentially collected and plotted for summated successes and failures. Results: The average intern required approximately 19 intubation attempts to complete the learning curve experience. There was no learning curve for airway assessment. Conclusions: The CUSUM analysis is an effective objective tool to define learning curves for technical skills. Vital information is provided for surgical programs that place residents in positions to manage airways, and limitless potential for defining the learning curves for technical skills is provided.",0,0
24419183,The prevalence of tracheal bronchus in pediatric patients undergoing rigid bronchoscopy,"Background: Tracheal bronchus (TB) is defined as an abnormal bronchus that originates directly from the lateral wall of the trachea above the carina and goes towards the upper lobe territory of the lung. We analyzed rigid endoscopies of the trachea in children to determine the incidence and characteristics of TB. Methods: In total, 1021 rigid endoscopies of the trachea recorded from children aged 0 to 6 years were analyzed. Endoscopic examination was performed from supraglottic region to carina using a 0-degree Hopkins rod-lens telescope. Patients with a TB were identified and the site of origin of the TB and its level above the carina was noted. Data of the identified patients was reviewed for the presence of preoperative airway findings such as stridor, upper lobe pneumonia and wheezing or atelectasis, other congenital anomalies, and intraoperative complications. Results: TB was detected in 11 (1.06%) of 1021 upper airway endoscopic examinations. All originated from the right lateral wall of the trachea. Six children had retained secretions in the TB, and 3 children had perioperative airway problems unrelated to the TB. One child showed right main stem bronchus narrowing as seen at the true carina, in the presence of a TB. All the children with TB exhibited at least 1 additional congenital anomaly at birth besides TB. Conclusions: TB is a relatively common congenital endoscopic lower airway anomaly in childhood, which is itself rarely symptomatic, but almost always coexists with other congenital anomalies.",0,0
8702056,[Difficult intubation in adults],"GOAL OF THIS REVIEW: We review the recent literature and our experience in order to determine how one can recognize and handle patients with difficult endotracheal intubation. Definition and incidence: ""An intubation is called difficult if a normally trained anesthesiologist needs more than 3 attempts or more than 10 min for a successful endotracheal intubation."" The incidence of difficult intubation depends on the degree of difficulty encountered showing a range of 1-18% of all intubations to about 2/10000-1/million for ""cannot ventilate-cannot intubate"" situations. Three ""cannot ventilate-cannot intubate"" situations are presented that occurred at our institution in the last 10 years out of about 85000 anaesthesias. Preoperative recognition: Intubation will be overtly difficult in patients with a small mouth opening, protruding upper teeth, a stiff neck, engorgement of the tongue, cervical swelling after an operation for a face tumour, or in patients with an unstable cervical spine. In about 50-70%, a difficult intubation can be detected preoperatively in patients with grossly normal cervical anatomy by three indirect signs: if the soft palate cannot be visualized (Mallampati classification), if the inframandibular space is smaller than normal, and if the mobility of the atlanto-occipital joint is reduced to below 15 degrees. It is essential that these indirect parameters be tested preoperatively, especially in patients in whom general anaesthesial is planned for a caesarean section or if an ileus intubation is planned. Handling: General handling of difficult intubation, use of special material including a portable unit, and confirmation of the endotracheal position of an endotrachaeal tube are outlined (CO2 et, SaO2, fibreoptic bronchoscopy, direct visualization of the translaryngeal position of the tube). The laryngeal mask airway, transtracheal jet ventilation, and the mini-coniotomy are selectively presented as alternative airways. The American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) difficult airway algorithm is presented. Conclusion: With better preoperative evaluation and clear guidelines and training for difficult intubation anaesthetic morbidity and mortality can be reduced.",0,0
26866753,Head-Elevated Patient Positioning Decreases Complications of Emergent Tracheal Intubation in the Ward and Intensive Care Unit,"Background: Based on the data from elective surgical patients, positioning patients in a back-up head-elevated position for preoxygenation and tracheal intubation can improve patient safety. However, data specific to the emergent setting are lacking. We hypothesized that back-up head-elevated positioning would be associated with a decrease in complications related to tracheal intubation in the emergency room environment. Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division (Seattle, WA). Eligible patients included all adults undergoing emergent tracheal intubation outside of the operating room by the anesthesiology-based airway service at 2 university-affiliated teaching hospitals. All intubations were through direct laryngoscopy for an indication other than full cardiopulmonary arrest. Patient characteristics and details of the intubation procedure were derived from the medical record. The primary study endpoint was the occurrence of a composite of any intubation-related complication: difficult intubation, hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, or pulmonary aspiration. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of the primary endpoint in the supine versus back-up head-elevated positions with adjustment for a priori-defined potential confounders (body mass index and a difficult intubation prediction score [Mallampati, obstructive sleep Apnea, Cervical mobility, mouth Opening, Coma, severe Hypoxemia, and intubation by a non-Anesthesiologist score]). Results: Five hundred twenty-eight patients were analyzed. Overall, at least 1 intubation-related complication occurred in 76 of 336 (22.6%) patients managed in the supine position compared with 18 of 192 (9.3%) patients managed in the back-up head-elevated position. After adjusting for body mass index and the Mallampati, obstructive sleep Apnea, Cervical mobility, mouth Opening, Coma, severe Hypoxemia, and intubation by a non-Anesthesiologist score, the odds of encountering the primary endpoint during an emergency tracheal intubation in a back-up head-elevated position was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.83; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Placing patients in a back-up head-elevated position, compared with supine position, during emergency tracheal intubation was associated with a reduced odds of airway-related complications.",0,0
19783539,"Randomized controlled trial of the Pentax AWS, Glidescope, and Macintosh laryngoscopes in predicted difficult intubation","Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the potential for the Pentax AWS and the Glidescope to reduce the difficulty of tracheal intubation in patients at increased risk for difficult tracheal intubation, in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Methods: Seventy-five consenting patients presenting for surgery requiring tracheal intubation, and who were deemed to possess characteristics indicating an increased risk for difficult tracheal intubation, were randomly assigned to undergo intubation using a Macintosh, AWS, or Glidescope laryngoscope (n=25 patients per group). All patients were intubated by one of three anaesthetists experienced in the use of each laryngoscope. Results: Both the Glidescope and the AWS significantly reduced the intubation difficulty score compared with the Macintosh. The rate of successful tracheal intubation was lower with the Macintosh (84%) compared with the Glidescope (96%) or the AWS (100%). There were no differences in the duration of tracheal intubation attempts between the devices. Both the Glidescope and the AWS significantly reduced the need for additional manoeuvres and improved the Cormack and Lehane view obtained at laryngoscopy, compared with the Macintosh. Tracheal intubation with the AWS but not the Glidescope reduced the degree of haemodynamic stimulation compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope. Conclusions: The AWS and the Glidescope laryngoscopes reduced the difficulty of tracheal intubation to a similar extent compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, in patients at increased risk for difficult tracheal intubation.",0,0
1391366,[Initial experiences with rigid angled optical systems as intubation aids in difficult intubation],"Referring to a classification by Cormack, difficult laryngoscopy of Grade 3 (only the epiglottis or a part of it can be seen) was simulated in 16 patients by lowering the blade of the laryngoscope, so that the epiglottis was pushed down and thus covered up the vocal cords. The object of the study was to test whether a newly developed rigid endoscope is a useful tool during intubation in cases of laryngoscopical view Grade 3. After simulation of Grade 3 as mentioned above, using a clip, an angle optic was fixed to the vertical part of the blade, so that the movement of the optic in the sagittal level was still possible. If an improvement of the laryngoscopical view was possible, the tracheal tube was inserted via the nasal route until the top of the tube could be seen in the oropharynx. The tracheal tube was inserted into the trachea, under endoscopic control. With this new method, naso-tracheal intubation under endoscopic control in all 16 patients was successful, without affecting the pharynx and the vocal cords.",0,0
1758747,Comparison of FEV1 and transcutaneous oxygen tension in the measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine,"The measurement of airway responsiveness in preschool children is hampered by the fact that most tests of airway caliber are difficult to carry out at a young age. Patient cooperation is only needed to a limited extent when transcutaneous oxygen tension (PtcO2) is used as an indicator of airway obstruction following bronchial provocation. In 51 children, aged 6-14 years with asthma we have measured PtcO2 and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) concurrently after bronchial provocation, using increasing doses of methacholine administered with a De Villbiss 646 nebulizer and a French-Rosenthal dosimeter. The shapes of the dose-response curves to PtcO2 and FEV1 show a close similarity. After methacholine challenge, the decrease in PtcO2 correlates highly with the decrease in FEV1. We conclude that in children a 20% decrease in PtcO2 can be used as a sensitive indicator of airway narrowing after methacholine challenge.",0,0
18471331,Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in obstetric patients scheduled for Caesarean delivery,"Background and objective: Failed intubation is an important cause of anaesthetic-related maternal mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx from the following preoperative airway predictive indices, in isolation and combination: modified Mallampati test, the ratio of height to thyromental distance and the Upper-Lip-Bite test. Methods: We collected data on 400 consecutive parturients scheduled for elective Caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation and then assessed all three factors before surgery. An experienced anaesthesiologist, not apprised of the recorded preoperative airway assessment, performed the laryngoscopy and grading (as per Cormack and Lehane's classification). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Results: Difficult laryngoscopy (Grade 3 or 4) occurred in 35 patients (8.75%). The ratio of height to thyromental distance had a higher sensitivity, positive predictive value and fewer false negatives than the other variables tested. The ratio of height to thyromental distance of 21.24 provided the best cut-off point for predicting subsequent difficult laryngoscopy. The odds ratio (95% CI) of the ratio of height to thyromental distance, Mallampati class and the Upper-Lip-Bite test were 127.8 (44.8-364.5), 49.8 (20.3-121.8) and 6.6 (2.29-19.30), respectively. Conclusion: The ratio of height to thyromental distance may prove a useful screening test for predicting difficult laryngoscopy in obstetric population.",1,1
12243027,[Prognostic value of a screening test for difficult microlaryngoscopy],Background: Several screening methods for the prediction of a difficult endotracheal intubation such as the test by Patil or the Mallampati-Score have been described. The incidence of difficult microlaryngoscopic procedures and the prognostic value of those screening tests for their prediction has not been investigated. Patients and methods: We examined 81 patients with mainly benign conditions of the larynx in a prospective study to evaluate the maximal overview of the glottis gained during microlaryngoscopy under supraglottic jetventilation. We used a specially designed ruler to measure the length of the invisible portion of the glottis. Results: The incidence of a difficult microlaryngoscopy was 4.9%. All employed screening scores did not reach a satisfactory positive predictive value (PPV). The routine indirect laryngoscopy with phonation had the highest PPV (50%) of all tests. Conclusion: Therefore an impossible indirect laryngoscopy can be regarded as a warning sign for a difficult microlaryngoscopic procedure. Summation-scores like the Arné Multivariate Risk Index or the use of check lists (Benumof) may improve the predictive value of preoperative screening.,0,0
16388893,Intracellular localization and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of steroid receptors: an overview,"Subcellular compartmentalization and dynamic movements of steroid receptors are major steps in executing their transcription regulatory function. Though significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying nuclear import of NLS-bearing proteins, our general and mechanistic understanding about the nuclear export processes has begun to emerge only recently. The discovery of most commonly utilized CRM1/exportin1 dependent nuclear export pathway is attributed to a potent nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B that helped dissecting this and other nuclear export pathways. Simultaneously, utilization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged intracellular steroid receptors has contributed to not only resolving controversial issue of subcellular localization of unliganded hormone receptors but also provided further insight into finer details of receptor dynamics in living cells. With judicious use of leptomycin B and expression of GFP-tagged receptors in living cells, existence of exportin1/CRM1 independent pathway(s), nuclear export signals and receptors for bi-directional translocation that are unique to steroid receptor trafficking have been specified. Currently, we appear to be arriving at a consensus that steroid/nuclear receptors follow dynamic nucleocytoplasmic processes that deviate from the ones commonly utilized by majority of other proteins.",0,0
16601961,Assessment of airway closure from deflation lung volume-pressure curve: sigmoidal equation revisited,"Objective: To assess a sigmoidal equation for describing airway closure. Design: Experimental study. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Eight piglets mechanically ventilated on zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP). Interventions: Control and lung saline lavage. Measurements and results: Lungs were inflated up to transpulmonary pressure of 30 cmH(2)O at constant flow (0.12l s(-1)) then deflated at the same flow rate up to the point at which oesophageal pressure was constant, which was assumed to represent complete airway closure. The deflation volume-transpulmonary pressure curve was fitted to: (1) a sigmoidal equation focusing on inflexion point and pressure at maximal compliance increase and (2) an exponential equation above an inflexion point determined by eyeballing. Data deviate from the exponential equation at the point of airway closure onset. The zero-volume intercept was determined. Complete airway closure was reached at -8.3+/-3.5cmH(2)O in control conditions and at -1.3+/-3.7 cmH(2)O after lavage (p < 0.05). Between control and lavage, onset of airway closure was 3.0+/-1.9 vs. 6.0+/-2.8 cmH(2)O (p <0.05), inflexion point 3.2+/-1.8 vs. 7.7+/-2.6 cmH(2)O (p <0.001), pressure at maximal compliance increase -1.9+/-0.7 vs. -0.03+/-2.1cmH(2)O (p <0.05) and zero-volume intercept -1.5+/-1.4 vs. 0.3+/-2.3cmH(2)O (p <0.05). Conclusions: During mechanical ventilation airways stay open and close around ZEEP in control but are closed above ZEEP after lavage. Inflexion point might reflect onset of airways closure in control. Pressure at maximal compliance increase was not a marker of complete airways closure. In control and lavage, pressure at maximal compliance increase and zero-volume intercept were reasonably equivalent.",0,0
19934141,Prehospital advanced airway management by ambulance technicians and paramedics: is clinical practice sufficient to maintain skills?,"Introduction: Ambulance paramedics are now trained routinely in advanced airway skills, including tracheal intubation. Initial training in this skill requires the insertion of 25 tracheal tubes, and further ongoing training is attained through clinical practice and manikin-based practice. In contrast, training standards for hospital-based practitioners are considerably greater, requiring approximately 200 tracheal intubations before practice is unsupervised. With debate growing regarding the efficacy of paramedic intubation, there is a need to assess current paramedic airway practice in order to review whether initial training and maintenance of skills provide an acceptable level of competence with which to practice advanced airway skills. Methods: All ambulance patient report forms (anonymised) for the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2007 were reviewed, and data relating to airway management were collected. Paramedic and technician identification codes were used to determine the number of airway procedures undertaken on an individual basis. Results: Of the 269 paramedics, 128 (47.6%) had undertaken no intubation and 204 (75.8%) had undertaken one or less intubation in the 12-month study period. The median number of intubations per paramedic during the 12-month period was 1.0 (range 0-11). A total of 76 laryngeal mask insertion attempts were recorded by 41 technicians and 30 paramedics. The median number of laryngeal mask insertions per paramedic/technician during the 12-month period was 0 (range 0-2). A survey of ongoing continuing professional development across all ambulance trusts demonstrated no provision for adequate training to compensate for the lack of clinical exposure to advanced airway skills. Conclusion: Paramedics use advanced airway skills infrequently. Continuing professional development programmes within ambulance trusts do not provide the necessary additional practice to maintain tracheal intubation skills at an acceptable level. Advanced airway management delivered by ambulance crews is likely to be inadequate with such infrequent exposure to the skill.",0,0
14997083,Peri-intubation cardiovascular response during low dose remifentanil or sufentanil administration in association with propofol TCI. A double blind comparison,"Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the effects on cardiovascular modifications induced by tracheal intubation when low dose infusion of remifentanil or sufentanil are used in association with propofol target controlled infusion. Methods: Sixty normotensive, ASA I-II-III, Mallampati Score <3 undergoing general anaesthesia for major elective abdominal surgery, received i.m. midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg) 30 min before induction. They were randomly divided in a double-blind fashion into two groups receiving for induction respectively target controlled infusion of propofol (site-effect 3.0 microg/ml) and sufentanil (0.01 microg/kg/min) or remifentanil (0.1 microg/kg/ min) infusion. Rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) was administered. Following intubation, the lungs were mechanically ventilated with an oxygen/air mixture. Results: Bispectral index score and haemodynamic variables were recorded at baseline, after induction, during intubation and 1-3-5 min after the trachea was intubated. No differences in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were observed in the sufentanil group, while the remifentanil group showed transient systolic and diastolic variations after intubating manoeuvers. The heart rate and bispectral index score were not affected in either group. Conclusion: In healthy normotensive patients the use of a small dose of either remifentanil or sufentanil after standard midazolam premedication, proved to be an effective strategy to blunt the cardiovascular response to intubation.",0,0
26468851,Does the Type of Maxillomandibular Deformity Influence Complication Rate in Orthognathic Surgery?,"Purpose: Patients may encounter various complications during and after orthognathic surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of complications in various skeletal deformities to see if an association exists. Materials and methods: This retrospective cohort study assessed patients in 2 groups. Group 1 had class III skeletal deformity and group 2 had class II skeletal deformity with vertical maxillary excess (VME). Complications were studied in 2 stages: Stage 1 included perioperative and immediate (first 24 hours) postoperative complications namely difficult intubation, blood transfusion, bad splits, pain, and postoperative airway problems. Stage 2 included postoperative complications (from 24 hours up to 6 months after surgery namely bad splits and relapse). Age, sex, operation time, and the amount of jaw movements were considered as variables. Types of skeletal deformity were predictive factor of the study. Results: The authors studied 248 patients in 2 groups. In group 1, 13 (8.2%) patients needed blood transfusion during surgery up to 24 hours after operation and 27 (30%) patients in group 2. Analysis of data demonstrated a significant difference for blood transfusion between 2 groups (P = 0.001). In group 1, 8 (5.1%) patients had a difficult intubation compared with 13 (14.4%) patients in group 2.Comparison of mandibular movement and maximum mouth opening (MMO) did not show significant differences between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The amount of maxillary movement and horizontal discrepancy were different statistically in 2 groups (P < 0.05). Analysis of the data showed a significant difference in intubation between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). There were no differences between the 2 groups for bad splits, postoperative airway problems, or paresthesia (P > 0.05). Results did not demonstrate a significant difference for pain between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with class II skeletal deformity and VME may have higher risk of perioperative blood loss and difficult intubation compared with patients with class III skeletal deformity.",0,0
26221151,Efficacy of the New Perilaryngeal Airway (CobraPLA™) Versus the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA™) to Improve Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure in Obese and Overweight Patients,"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of Cobra perilaryngeal airway (Cobra PLA™) for obese patients under general anesthesia and also to compare the results with those of classic laryngeal mask airway (LMA™). Materials and methods: Seventy-three overweight and obese patients were included in this study. The patients were randomly assigned to LMA™ or Cobra PLA™ groups. Time required for intubation, successful intubation attempt, airway sealing pressure and incidence of complications including blood staining, sore throat and dysphagia were assessed and noted. Results: Thirty-six and 37 patients were randomly allocated to LMA™ and Cobra PLA™ groups, respectively. Most patients were males and had Mallampati Class II airway in both groups. The first attempt and overall insertion success for Cobra PLA™ was significantly higher compared to LMA (P<0.05). Airway insertion was more successful (P = 0.027; 94% vs. 77%) with Cobra PLA™. Insertion times were similar with Cobra PLA™ and LMA™ (Cobra PLA™, 29.94±16.35s; LMA™, 27.00±7.88s). The oropharyngeal leak pressure in the Cobra PLA™ group (24.80±0.90 H2O) was significantly higher than that in LMA™ group (19±1 H2O, p<0.001). Sore throat was more frequent in the LMA™ group although it did not reach statistical significance (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.33). Blood staining on airway tube was seen in both groups with a higher incidence in the Cobra PLA™ group (Fisher's Exact test, P = 0.02). Incidence of dysphagia was not different between the two groups. Conclusion: CobraPLA™ was found to be safe with low complications. It provided better airway sealing with high rate of the first insertion success for use in obese and overweight patients. This study recommends the use of CobraPLA™ as a rescue device in emergency situations for obese and overweight patients.",0,0
9613265,Requirements for target-controlled infusion of propofol to insert the laryngeal mask airway,"The success rate for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway was assessed in 60 patients using a target-controlled infusion of propofol. Eleven of 15 patients who received a target propofol concentration of 5 micrograms.ml-1 had the laryngeal mask inserted successfully within 3 min of induction of anaesthesia. Fourteen of 15 patients who received 6 micrograms.ml-1 had successful insertion within 3 min and all 15 patients who received 7 micrograms.ml-1 had successful insertion within 3 min. Patients who received 8 micrograms.ml-1 had successful insertion within 90s of induction of anaesthesia. The increased success rate of LMA insertion with the higher target propofol concentrations was achieved without major haemodynamic effects in this group of fit patients. However, adverse cardiovascular effects may occur with these doses in elderly or unfit patients. It is important in individual patients to titrate the target propofol concentration to achieve the required clinical endpoint.",0,0
21140632,Factors predicting endoscopic exposure of Zenker's diverticulum,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were 1) to understand which anatomic variables are associated with failed endoscopic exposure of Zenker's diverticulum and 2) to enable preoperative selection of patients suitable for endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum on the basis of anatomic variables. Methods: We performed a prospective, Institutional Review Board-approved study of 30 patients undergoing attempted endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum. Three categorical variables (sex, presence of maxillary dentition, and Mallampati score) and 6 continuous variables (age, neck circumference, hyomental distance, neck length, neck extension, and body mass index [BMI]) were collected before operation and then correlated to successful endoscopic exposure of the Zenker's pouch by use of a Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test, respectively. Results: Exposure was unsuccessful in 9 of 30 patients (30%). Factors that correlated significantly with exposure failure included a shorter neck length (7.2 +/- 1.2 cm; p = 0.047), a shorter hyomental distance (5.0 +/- 1.1 cm; p = 0.004), and a higher BMI (27.2 +/- 4.0 kg/m2; p = 0.05). The presence of maxillary dentition did not reach significance in exposure failure, but did show a trend toward an association. Conclusions: Surgical exposure in endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum tends to be significantly less successful in patients with short necks, decreased hyomental distance, and/or a high BMI. An open approach should be considered in this patient population.",0,0
23139496,Predictive variables for difficult intubations in oral and maxillofacial surgery,"Many factors affect the difficulty of endotracheal intubation some of which are related to the condition of the patients. A few assessment tools have been developed to predict intubation difficulty but none is all inclusive thereby being inadequate for comprehensive and accurate evaluation. We assessed the usefulness of four categories of predictive variables namely; the LEMON score, Demographic indices, Tumour site and Intraoral Position of tumour (IOP), in predicting intubation difficulty among a group of patients with orofacial tumours. By statistical analysis, a significant correlation between predictions by LEMON score and actual intubation difficulty was observed while neck mobility (P=0.28) and Mallampati scores (P=0.49) were the most important criteria in the scoring system. Significant association was also observed with demographic indices and difficulty whereby the Optimal Interincisal Distance (OID) had the greatest impact (P=0.048). There was no difference in the difficulty posed by the different sites and intraoral positions of tumours in this study. We therefore suggest the adoption of the LEMON score and consideration of the demographic indices when assessing patients with orofacial tumours for intubation difficulty. Three important variables should be given greater value, these are, neck mobility, Mallampatti score and optimal interincisal distance.",0,0
1755552,[Comparative value of clinical signs of difficult tracheal intubation in women],"A prospective study was designed to compare the value of clinical signs aimed to predict difficult intubation in women. A group of 663 women, scheduled for elective surgery, were assessed by an anaesthetist at the preanaesthetic visit. Following parameters were assessed: the degree of mouth opening, the chin-hyoid bone and the chin-thyroid cartilage distances, dental and facial abnormalities, age, weight. All patients were ranked on the Mallampati scale. Another anaesthetist carried out the anaesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation. The latter was deemed to have been difficult if special procedures had been required (use of a stylet, a fibroscope, or Sellick's manoeuvre). In accordance with these criteria 12.5% of women were difficult to intubate. Furthermore, he assessed the degree of glottic exposure, using a Macintosh blade and according to Cormack's classification. Six per cent of women were ranked C or D in Cormack's classification (C: the glottic aperture was not seen; D: the epiglottis was not seen). Finally 66% of women with difficult intubation and 84% of those with severely abnormal glottic exposure were ranked greater than 1 on the Mallampati scale. This scale had high sensitivity (0.84), but a specificity of only 0.66. Other clinical criteria (mouth opening, the chin-hyoid bone distance) had a lower sensitivities, but seemed more specific. Multivariate analysis showed that specificity could be improved (0.84) if the distance between the upper and lower incisor teeth (mouth opening) was associated with Mallampati's rank, without any loss in sensitivity. A simple chart is proposed to assess the risk of difficult intubation.",1,1
10709371,Problematic intubation in soldiers: are there predisposing factors?,"Attempts by a combat medical officer to secure the airway of a multiple-injury patient in the field may frequently end in failure. The recurrence of such failures, despite Advanced Trauma Life Support training, is perplexing; therefore, we studied the prevalence of clinical criteria that could predispose active soldiers to difficult intubation. Such known anatomical features and the Mallampati classification were assessed by experts in 250 soldiers at a military outpatient clinic of the Israel Defense Forces. It was found that most soldiers had normal airways. Limitations of head and neck movement, or in opening the mouth, were not observed. Other risk factors were noted in only a small percentage of the study population. Mallampati classes I and II were noted in 40% and 31%, respectively. No statistically significant differences between young (18-21 years) and older (40-44 years) soldiers were found. It was concluded that difficult intubations among soldiers are unlikely to be associated with anatomical causes. Complicated scenarios and deficient skills of the physicians are the most important factors that contribute to in-field failures to secure airway control. Several recommendations to remedy this situation are offered.",0,0
18212566,Desflurane but not sevoflurane impairs airway and respiratory tissue mechanics in children with susceptible airways,"Background: Although sevoflurane and desflurane exert bronchoactive effects, their impact on the airway and respiratory tissue mechanics have not been systematically compared in children, especially in those with airway susceptibility (AS). The aim of this study was to assess airway and respiratory tissue mechanics in children with and without AS during sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia. Methods: Respiratory system impedance was measured in healthy control children (group C, n = 20) and in those with AS (group AS, n = 20). Respiratory system impedance was determined during propofol anesthesia and during inhalation of sevoflurane and desflurane 1 minimum alveolar concentration in random order. Airway resistance, tissue damping, and elastance were determined from the respiratory system impedance spectra by model fitting. Results: Children in group AS exhibited significantly higher respiratory impedance parameters compared with those in group C. Sevoflurane slightly decreased airway resistance (-7.0 +/- 1.5% vs. -4.8 +/- 2.4% in groups C and AS, respectively) in both groups. In contrast, desflurane caused elevations in airway resistance and tissue mechanical parameters, with markedly enhanced airway narrowing in children with AS (18.2 +/- 2.8% vs. 53.9 +/- 5%; P < 0.001 for airway resistance in groups C and AS, respectively). Neither the order of drug administration nor the time after the establishment of their steady state concentrations affected these findings. Conclusions: These results emphasized the deleterious effects of desflurane on the airways, particularly in children with susceptible airways in contrast with the consistent beneficial effects of sevoflurane, questioning the use of desflurane in children with AS.",0,0
15200543,Difficult Airway Society guidelines for management of the unanticipated difficult intubation,"Problems with tracheal intubation are infrequent but are the most common cause of anaesthetic death or brain damage. The clinical situation is not always managed well. The Difficult Airway Society (DAS) has developed guidelines for management of the unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation in the non-obstetric adult patient without upper airway obstruction. These guidelines have been developed by consensus and are based on evidence and experience. We have produced flow-charts for three scenarios: routine induction; rapid sequence induction; and failed intubation, increasing hypoxaemia and difficult ventilation in the paralysed, anaesthetised patient. The flow-charts are simple, clear and definitive. They can be fully implemented only when the necessary equipment and training are available. The guidelines received overwhelming support from the membership of the DAS. Disclaimer: It is not intended that these guidelines should constitute a minimum standard of practice, nor are they to be regarded as a substitute for good clinical judgement.",0,0

22488156,The upper airway evaluation of habitual snorers and obstructive sleep apnea patients,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) and upper airway examination findings of habitual snorers and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Materials and methods: This study included 264 patients whose tonsils were evaluated in 4 grades. The Mallampati classification was used to determine the relationship between tongue and palate. All patients performed the Müller maneuver in a sitting position. The Fujita classification was used to define the type of obstruction. All patients had polysomnography and were divided into 4 groups according to AHI. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between examination findings and AHI. Results: Of the patients, 133 (50.4%) were habitual snorers, 66 (25%) were mild OSA, 40 (15.2%) were moderate OSA and 25 (9.5%) were severe OSA patients. There was a positive correlation between neck circumference, BMI and AHI in males (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference between patient groups according to Mallampati classification, collapse at the velopharyngeal level and hypopharyngeal level and Fujita classification (all p < 0.001). There were significant relationships between tonsil size, Fujita classification, Mallampati classification, collapse ratios and AHI. Conclusion: We saw that hypopharyngeal area often contributes to obstruction and some examination methods correlate more with AHI. This can aid sleep physicians in the evaluation of OSA patients.",0,0
23373047,"Anaesthesia for TMJ Ankylosis with the Use of TIVA, Followed by Endotracheal Intubation","TMJ ankylosis, though it is not common, is an anaesthetic challenge, as it is a difficult airway situation with a moderate to a severely limited mouth opening. Fiber-optic intubation is the gold standard for such cases, but it may not be readily available at all centres. Blind nasal intubation, retro-grade intubation and tracheostomy are the other alternatives, but they require patient co-operation and are associated with considerable morbidity. We are presenting a case of unilateral TMJ ankylosis in a 12 years old boy who was posted for condylectomy and interpositional arthroplasty.

25939573,Airway compromise in children with anterior neck burns: Beware the scalded child,"Aim: The aim of the study was to describe characteristics of children with anterior neck burns admitted to our Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and to highlight potential airway complications associated with these injuries, especially in children with scalds. Methods: Retrospective review of children with anterior neck burns requiring admission to PICU January 2004-December 2013. Results: Fifty-two children with anterior neck burns were admitted; average age 6.6 years. Thirty sustained flame/explosion injuries; 22 scalds. Seventy-nine per cent were male. Mean total body surface area (TBSA) burn 21%. Forty-seven were intubated. Some primary reasons for intubation included unconsciousness, inhalational/ingestion/direct airway injury and large TBSA. Majority, however, required intubation for airway complications secondary to subcutaneous/soft tissue anterior neck oedema not associated with airway injury/ingestion/inhalational burns. The scalds subgroup mean age was 2.3 years. Eighty-two per cent were male. Mean TBSA 18%. There were no inhalational/ingestion/airway injuries. Nineteen children were intubated; average 9.3 h post-injury. Majority (63%) were intubated post-arrival in the Burn Unit, compared with flame/explosion group (32%). Primary reasons for intubation included large burns, although majority (74%) required intubation for airway complications secondary to subcutaneous and soft tissue anterior neck oedema. For the flame/explosion group this was the case in only 46%, with other primary reasons such as unconsciousness or inhalational injury being the immediate precedent. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that subcutaneous and soft tissue oedema secondary to anterior neck burns may contribute to airway narrowing and compromise requiring intubation. When assessing children's airways, evolving oedema should be recognised and higher observation or early intubation considered regardless of the mechanism of injury.",0,0
23277808,Predictors of difficult intubation defined by the intubation difficulty scale (IDS): predictive value of 7 airway assessment factors,"Background: The intubation difficulty scale (IDS) has been used as a validated difficulty score to define difficult intubation (DI). The purpose of this study is to identify airway assessment factors and total airway score (TAS) for predicting DI defined by the IDS. Methods: There were 305 ASA physical status 1-2 patients, aged 19-70 years, who underwent elective surgery with endotracheal intubation. During the pre-anesthetic visit, we evaluated patients by 7 preoperative airway assessment factors, including the following: Mallampati classification, thyromental distance, head & neck movement, body mass index (BMI), buck teeth, inter-incisor gap, and upper lip bite test (ULBT). After endotracheal intubation, patients were divided into 2 groups based on their IDS score estimated with 7 variables: normal (IDS < 5) and DI (IDS ≥ 5) groups. The incidence of TAS (> 6) and high score of each airway assessment factor was compared in two groups: odds ratio, confidence interval (CI) of 95%, with a significant P value ≤ 0.05. Results: The odds ratio of TAS (> 6), ULBT (class III), head & neck movement (< 90°), inter-incisor gap (< 4 cm), BMI (≥ 25 kg/m(2)) and Mallampati classification (≥ class III) were respectively 13.57 (95% CI = 2.99-61.54, P < 0.05), 12.48 (95% CI = 2.50-62.21, P < 0.05), 3.11 (95% CI = 0.87-11.13), 2.32 (95% CI = 0.75-7.19), 2.22 (95% CI = 0.81-6.06), and 1.22 (95% CI = 0.38-3.89). Conclusions: We suggest that TAS (> 6) and ULBT (class III) are the most useful factors predicting DI.",1,1
21800667,[Successful use of i-gel in three patients with difficult intubation and difficult ventilation],"I report successful ventilation through the i-gel and tracheal intubation through it, in patients in whom both facemask ventilation and tracheal intubation were difficult. Case 1: A 54-year-old woman, 157 cm, 60 kg, was scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preoperatively, neither difficult intubation nor difficult mask ventilation was predicted. After induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade, both tracheal intubation and facemask ventilation were difficult. Insertion of a size 3 i-gel allowed adequate ventilation. The i-gel was removed and tracheal intubation was achieved using the Airway Scope. Case 2: In a 32-year-old woman, 162 cm, 46 kg, with predicted difficult intubation (thyromental distance of 4 cm), both tracheal intubation and facemask ventilation were difficult after induction of anesthesia. Insertion of a size 3 i-gel allowed adequate ventilation. Tracheal intubation through the i-gel was successful with the aid of a fibreoptic bronchoscope. Case 3: In a 54-year-old woman, 157 cm, 60 kg, with predicted difficult intubation (thyromental distance of 5 cm), both tracheal intubation and facemask ventilation were difficult after induction of anesthesia. Insertion of a size 3 i-gel allowed adequate ventilation. Fiberoptic tracheal intubation through the i-gel was successful. I feel that the i-gel has a potential role as a rescue device, by allowing ventilation and tracheal intubation in patients with difficult airways.",0,0
24103561,"Cardiovascular risk and mortality in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis: sleep study, pulmonary function, respiratory mechanics, upper airway collapsibility, autonomic nervous activity, depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life: a prospective, double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial","Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most serious public health problems. The increasing prevalence of CKD in developed and developing countries has led to a global epidemic. The hypothesis proposed is that patients undergoing dialysis would experience a marked negative influence on physiological variables of sleep and autonomic nervous system activity, compromising quality of life. Methods/design: A prospective, consecutive, double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial is proposed to address the effect of dialysis on sleep, pulmonary function, respiratory mechanics, upper airway collapsibility, autonomic nervous activity, depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life in patients with CKD. The measurement protocol will include body weight (kg); height (cm); body mass index calculated as weight/height(2); circumferences (cm) of the neck, waist, and hip; heart and respiratory rates; blood pressures; Mallampati index; tonsil index; heart rate variability; maximum ventilatory pressures; negative expiratory pressure test, and polysomnography (sleep study), as well as the administration of specific questionnaires addressing sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life. Discussion: CKD is a major public health problem worldwide, and its incidence has increased in part by the increased life expectancy and increasing number of cases of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Sleep disorders are common in patients with renal insufficiency. Our hypothesis is that the weather weight gain due to volume overload observed during interdialytic period will influence the degree of collapsibility of the upper airway due to narrowing and predispose to upper airway occlusion during sleep, and to investigate the negative influences of haemodialysis in the physiological variables of sleep, and autonomic nervous system, and respiratory mechanics and thereby compromise the quality of life of patients. Trial registration: The protocol for this study is registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC RBR-7yhr4w and World Health Organization under Universal Trial Number UTN: U1111-1127-9390 [http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-7yhr4w/]).",0,0
21641785,Prompt correction of endotracheal tube positioning after intubation prevents further inappropriate positions,"Study objective: To determine whether the timely correction of endotracheal tube (ETT) positioning prevents further inappropriate positions. Design: Prospective crossover study. Setting: University-affiliated hospital. Patients: 44 adult, ASA physical status 1, 2, and 3 patients undergoing open or laparoscopic abdominal procedures. Interventions: ETT positioning was verified by both auscultation and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB), after intubation, and before extubation. In laparoscopic procedures, two additional measurements were performed: after maximal abdominal gas insufflation and with head-down position. An ETT in the bronchus or at the carina was considered an inappropriate placement. An ETT ≤ one cm from the carina was considered a critical placement. Measurements: The frequency of inappropriate and critical ETT positioning with both auscultation and FOB and the number of ETTs that remained in an incorrect position despite repositioning. Main results: FOB detected 5 inappropriately positioned ETTs, 4 of which were also detected by chest auscultation (P = 0.99). Critical positioning was detected by FOB in 6 patients, three of which were also detected by auscultation (P = 0.24). There were 15 other ""out-of-desired range"" positions (out of the 3-5 cm range) - one placed too high and 14 placed too low, while 18 were placed within the range of positions. All patients with inappropriate ETT positioning were women (P = 0.005). Age, body mass index, Mallampati grade > 3, thyromental distance < 6 cm, or laryngoscopy grade ≥ 2 were not associated with either inappropriate or critical placement. No episodes of inappropriate or critical positioning were detected by FOB or auscultation at the end of surgery. Conclusions: Early detection and prompt correction of inappropriate ETT positioning after intubation prevented further ETT migration into undesired positions.",0,0
24997151,The Sox4/Tcf7l1 axis promotes progression of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"The transcription factor Sox4 plays an indispensable role in the development of early progenitor B cells from hematopoietic stem cells. However, its role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a malignant counterpart of normal progenitor B cells, is not fully understood. Here we show that SOX4 is highly expressed in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To systematically study the function of Sox4 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we established a genetically defined mouse leukemia model by transforming progenitor B cells carrying a floxed Sox4 allele and inducing deletion of the allele by the self-excising Cre recombinase. This model allowed us to work with two groups of leukemic cells that had either one copy or both copies of Sox4 deleted. We found that depletion of Sox4 in transformed cells in vitro reduced cell growth in vitro and the progression of leukemia in vivo. Moreover, depletion of Sox4 in leukemic cells in vivo prolonged the survival of the mice, suggesting that it could be a potential target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Our microarray and bioChIP studies revealed that Tcf7l1 was the key gene directly regulated by Sox4. Knockdown of Tcf7l1 reduced cell proliferation, just as did knockout of Sox4, and ectopic expression of Tcf7l1 could reverse the effect of Sox4 knockout on cell proliferation. These data suggest that Sox4 and Tcf7l1 form a functional axis that promotes the progression of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",0,0

8688268,A new tracheal tube for difficult intubation,"We have compared a new Portex tracheal tube with the Oxford tube in performing simulated grade 3 difficult intubations. The Portex tube was modified so that the bevel faced backwards, as in the Oxford tube. A gum elastic introducer was used with both tubes. The time taken and number of attempts needed were recorded, with changes in arterial pressure, heart rate and incidence of sore throat. Both tubes were successful in avoiding the problem of obstruction at the cords, which occurs when a standard Magill tube is used with an introducer. Thus the new tube has the merits of the Oxford tube without the disadvantages of rubber. It is suitable for both easy and difficult intubations with advantages in safety, cost and convenience. An unexpected but important finding was a clear learning effect, despite both investigators being familiar with the technique at the outset. Over the course of the study, intubation time decreased progressively (P < 0.001). This provides new evidence of the need for trainees to practise the art of intubation when the cords are not visible. Our estimate of the learning ""half-life"" was 15 intubations; we conclude that 30 simulated grade 3 intubations would be a reasonable objective for trainees before handling high-risk cases.",0,0
19233881,Expected difficult tracheal intubation: a prospective comparison of direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy in 200 patients,"Background: The Berci-Kaplan video laryngoscope was developed to improve the visualization of the glottis and ease tracheal intubation. Whether this technique is also effective in patients with an expected difficult intubation is unclear. We have prospectively evaluated the conditions and success rate of tracheal intubation in patients with a Mallampati score of III or IV. Methods: Two hundred patients, undergoing general anaesthesia, were randomized to be intubated using direct laryngoscopy (n=100) or video laryngoscopy (n=100). Visualization of the vocal cords, success rate, time for intubation, and the need for additional manoeuvres (laryngeal manipulations, head positioning, and Eschmann stylet) were evaluated. Results: Video laryngoscopy produced better results for the visualization of the glottis using Cormack and Lehane criteria (P<0.001), success rate (n=92 vs 99, P=0.017), and the time for intubation [60 (77) vs 40 (31) s, P=0.0173]. In addition, the number of optimizing manoeuvres was also significantly decreased [1.2 (1.3) vs 0.5 (0.7), P<0.001]. Conclusions: Video laryngoscopy, when compared with direct laryngoscopy for difficult intubations, provides a significantly better view of the cords, a higher success rate, faster intubations, and less need for optimizing manoeuvres. Therefore, we feel that the video laryngoscopy leads to a clinically relevant improvement of intubation conditions and can be recommended for difficult airway management.",0,0

22301204,Shoulder and head elevation improves laryngoscopic view for tracheal intubation in nonobese as well as obese individuals,"Study objective: To determine whether shoulder and head elevation, such that the patient's ear lies at or higher than the sternum (""ramp""), improves laryngoscopic grade in adult patients of various body mass index (BMI) values. Design: Prospective, unblinded study, with patients and laryngoscopists acting as their own controls. Setting: Operating room of a university-affiliated hospital. Patients: 189 adult ASA physical status 1, 2, and 3 patients. Interventions: After performing a standard preoperative airway evaluation and inducing general anesthesia, the anesthetist performed and graded two laryngoscopies: one in the ""ramp"" position and one in the ""sniff"" position. Measurements: Patient BMI, Mallampati airway class, thyromental distance, neck circumference, cervical extension ability, Cormack and Lehane laryngoscopic grade for each laryngoscopy, subjective lifting force required, and need for external laryngeal pressure were recorded. Main results: Use of the ""ramp"" provided significantly better or equal laryngoscopic views, relative to those with the ""sniff"" position, in the entire study population. Conclusions: Shoulder and head elevation by any means that brings the patient's sternum onto the horizontal plane of the external auditory meatus maintains or improves laryngoscopic view significantly.",0,0
9788791,Hoarseness after cardiac surgery,"Objective: To investigate the incidence, severity, and duration of hoarseness after adult cardiac surgery and to examine movement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) during neck extension for sternotomy. Design: Prospective study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Seventy-two adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery (assessment of hoarseness was completed in 68). Interventions: An ETT with an internal diameter of 8.0 mm and 7.5 mm was used for men and women, respectively. After surgical positioning, the ETT was placed with its tip about 3 cm above the carina. Measures: ETT migration during positioning for sternotomy was measured using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Hoarseness was examined at 6-12 hrs after extubation. Results: The ETT moved away from the carina during surgical positioning and the migration was 11+/-6 (1-27) mm [mean+/-SD (range)]. Hoarseness occurred in 32% of the patients (22/68), of whom five (23%) were grade 1 on a four-point scale (0-3), 14 (64%) were grade 2, and three (14%) were grade 3 (aphonic). The duration of hoarseness was 4+/-3 (1-14) days, except in one patient with left vocal cord paralysis (60 days). When this patient was excluded, intubation time was an independent predictor of the severity of hoarseness (p=0.0001). Conclusions: Hoarseness after cardiac surgery is common. Most hoarseness is transient and its severity is predicted by duration of intubation. Positioning for sternotomy displaces the ETT cuff away from the carina. This may cause persistent hoarseness because displaced cuff from trachea to larynx may damage the recurrent laryngeal nerve or vocal cords.",0,0
24529675,Difficult fiber-optic intubation in a patient with giant neck masses: The role of McCoy laryngoscope in elevating compressed laryngeal aperture,"Airway management in patients with giant neck masses is usually a challenge to anesthesiologists. A giant neck mass could compress the airway and thus impede endotracheal intubation. We encountered a situation where the giant neck masses of a patient pushed the epiglottis posteriorly toward the posterior pharyngeal wall and compressed the laryngeal aperture narrowing after anesthetic induction, causing direct laryngoscopic intubation and sequential fiber-optic intubation failed. The neck masses twisted the aryepiglottic fold tortuously and clogged the laryngeal aperture tightly, making a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope unable to pass through the laryngeal aperture. Later, we utilized a McCoy laryngoscope alternately to lift the compressed larynx up and away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, creating a passage and completing endotracheal intubation successfully with the aid of a gum elastic bougie. Our case suggested that the tilting tip blade of the McCoy laryngoscope could lever the tongue base up against the tumor mass compression to improve laryngeal views and facilitate endotracheal intubation when a difficult fiber-optic intubation was encountered on a compressed laryngeal aperture.",0,0
21364502,A randomized clinical comparison of the Intersurgical i-gel and LMA Unique in non-obese adults during general surgery,"Background: The i-gel is a cuffless, single-use supralaryngeal airway device designed to provide a more effective seal than the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Although the superiority of the i-gel compared to the LMA Classic was determined in a previous study, no studies have been performed that compare it to the disposable LMA Unique. The aim of this study was to compare the Intersurgical i-gelTM against the LMA UniqueTM (uLMA) in terms of ease of placement, time of insertion, and adequacy of placement through a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Methods: Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and written informed consent, 50 adult patients were recruited for this study. All enrolled patients were ASA 1-2, Mallampati I-II, and scheduled to receive general anesthesia. Patients were randomized to have either the i-gel or the uLMA placed for airway management. After standardized induction techniques, the airway was secured with the assigned device. All patients were interviewed postoperatively for sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Standard vital signs, end-tidal CO2, tidal volumes, and peak pressures were recorded. Insertion time, leak pressures, and anatomic placement as assessed fiberoptically for the i-gel were recorded. Ease of placement and complications were also recorded. Results: The insertion time was significantly less with the i-gel (21.04±12.6 s vs. 30.04±14.1 s, P=0.02). An inadequate seal was noted in three patients with the i-gel, and it was exchanged for the uLMA in all three cases. There were no significant differences in the ease of insertion, leak pressures, or fiberoptic view. Most of the fiberoptic views, as assessed through the drain tube, demonstrated esophageal mucosa (22/25). Patients receiving the i-gel were significantly more likely to require a second attempt at insertion by the anesthesiologist (OR 8.11, CI 1.1-58.6, P=0.03). Finally, patients receiving the size 5 i-gel were significantly more likely to complain of immediate postoperative symptoms, such as sore throat and dysphagia (OR 29.32, CI 1.4-613.1, P=0.03). Conclusion: Although the i-gel had a faster insertion time in comparison to the uLMA, there was a greater need for repeat insertions. The weight criteria established by the manufacturer may need to be readjusted to recommend a larger size device in some patients less than 90 kg because all of the repeat insertions were in patients weighing more than 80 kg. In all other aspects of its use, the i-gel performed similarly to the uLMA.",0,0
27625481,Reliability and validity of a tool to assess airway management skills in anesthesia trainees,"Background and aims: Gaining expertise in procedural skills is essential for achieving clinical competence during anesthesia training. Supervisors have the important responsibility of deciding when the trainee can be allowed to perform various procedures without direct supervision while ensuring patient safety. This requires robust and reliable assessment techniques. Airway management with bag-mask ventilation and tracheal intubation are routinely performed by anesthesia trainees at induction of anesthesia and to save lives during a cardiorespiratory arrest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the construct validity, and inter-rater and test-retest reliability of a tool designed to assess competence in bag-mask ventilation followed by tracheal intubation in anesthesia trainees. Material and methods: Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Tracheal intubation and bag-mask ventilation skills in 10 junior and 10 senior anesthesia trainees were assessed by two investigators on two occasions at a 3-4 weeks interval, using a procedure-specific assessment tool. Results: Average kappa value for inter-rater reliability was 0.91 and 0.99 for the first and second assessments, respectively, with an average agreement of 95%. The average agreement for test-retest reliability was 82% with a kappa value of 0.39. Senior trainees obtained higher scores compared to junior trainees in all areas of assessment, with a significant difference for patient positioning, preoxygenation, and laryngoscopy technique, depicting good construct validity. Conclusion: The tool designed to assess bag-mask ventilation and tracheal intubation skills in anesthesia trainees demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability, fair test-retest reliability, and good construct validity. The authors recommend its use for formative and summative assessment of junior anesthesia trainees.",0,0
10490160,Intubation via LMA in pediatric patients with difficult airways,"Purpose: To report two cases of successful tracheal intubation in difficult pediatric airways using a conventional laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with an extended polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube after laryngeal assessment with a fibreoptic device. Clinical features: Two cases, Dandy-Walker and Pierre Robin syndromes, were scheduled for surgery. They were premedicated with 0.5 mg x kg(-1) promethazine p.o. 90 min before surgery. Both patients arrived in the operating room sedated, with dry mouth, and without evidence of increased intracranial tension or airway obstruction. Inhalational induction with isoflurane 0.5-3% was commenced. Conventional tracheal intubation was impossible in both cases. In each an LMA was inserted to maintain ventilation, anesthesia, and to facilitate intubation. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy was used to assess the larynx, followed by blind intubation via the LMA using extended PVC tracheal tube (TT). Anesthesia was maintained during intubation using Mapleson F anesthesia circuit attached to a connector with fibreoptic bronchoscope adapter. Conclusion: This report describes the assessment of the airway with fibreoptic bronchoscopy after LMA insertion facilitated blind tracheal intubation in two children with difficult airways.",0,0
7125155,[The problem of the difficult intubation],"Endotracheal intubation has become widespread routine in modern anaesthesiology and intensive care. Nevertheless, there are still patients in whom endotracheal intubation fails or is hampered by anatomical malformations. In these cases ""conventional"" attempts at intubation are not only time-consuming but also involve considerable risk for the patient, including total failure. Moreover these techniques (e.g., blind nasal) require a highly skilled performer as well as a good deal of luck. Under such circumstances, fiberoptic endotracheal intubation is the method of choice. This technique is easy to perform even by untrained persons, achieves a high rate of success and nearly totally lacks special hazards. The practical points of the procedure are outlined and possible problems discussed, which, however, are rare.",0,0
24020707,"Comparison of propofol-dexmedetomidine, tiopental-dexmedetomidine and etomidate-dexmedetomidine combinations' effects on the tracheal intubation conditions without using muscle relaxants","Background: In our study, we aimed to compare the endotracheal intubation conditions without muscle relaxants during induction with the combinations of dexmedotimidine-propofol, dexmedotimidine-thiopenthal and dexmedetomidine-etomidate. Method: Seventy-six patients, in ASA risk group I-II, between ages 20-60 years, with Mallampati Class 1 were included in the study. All patients were premedicated with midazolam. The patients were randomly divided into three groups as Group P (n=30, dexmedetomidine-propofol), Group T (n=30, dexmedetomidine-thiopenthal), Group E (n=16, dexmedetomidine-etomidate). All patients received dexmedetomidine 1 μg.kg-1 in 10 min. Then, the patients were administered 2.5 mg.kg-1 propofol for Group P, 5 mg.kg-1 thiopental for Group T and 0.3 mg.kg-1 etomidate for Group E during induction. Hemodynamic data of the patients were recorded before induction, after dexmedetomidine administration, immediately after intubation and 3, 5 and 10 minutes after intubation. Results: There was no difference between the groups according to hemodynamic data. Sixteen patients in Group P and 10 patients in Group T had acceptable intubation conditions. Muscle relaxant was needed in 14, 20 and 16 patients in Groups P, T and E, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, we determined that best intubation conditions without muscle relaxants were achieved with propofol-dexmedetomidine combination. None of the patients receiving etomidate -dexmedetomidine combination could be intubated without muscle relaxants (Tab. 6, Ref. 29).",0,0
24891193,Approaches to manual ventilation,"Manual ventilation is a basic skill that involves airway assessment, maneuvers to open the airway, and application of simple and complex airway support devices and effective positive-pressure ventilation using a bag and mask. An important part of manual ventilation is recognizing its success and when it is difficult or impossible and a higher level of support is necessary to sustain life. Careful airway assessment will help clinicians identify what and when the next step needs to be taken. Often simple airway maneuvers such as the head tilt/chin lift and jaw thrust can achieve a patent airway. Appropriate use of airway adjuncts can further aid the clinician in situations in which airway maneuvers may not be sufficient. Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) plays a vital role in effective manual ventilation, improving both oxygenation and ventilation as well as buying time while preparations are made for endotracheal intubation. There are, however, situations in which BMV may be difficult or impossible. Anticipation and early recognition of these situations allows clinicians to quickly make adjustments to the method of BMV or to employ a more advanced intervention to avoid delays in establishing adequate oxygenation and ventilation.",0,0
16438012,Management of difficult intubation in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis--a case report,"We describe a case of difficult intubation in a patient suffering from ankylosing spondylitis undergoing total hip replacement surgery. The anesthetic management of 42 year old patient with difficult airway is discussed. Failure of epidural anesthesia procedure necessitated general anesthesia. The problems of performing awake fibreoptic intubation and other alternative techniques to secure the airway are described. Cervical spine involvement in ankylosing spondylitis is of great concern for the anesthetist. Longstanding progressive course of this disease leads to fibrosis, ossification and ankylosis of entire spine and sacroiliac joints. Cervical spine mobility is decreased and in severe cases total fixity occurs in a flexed position. Patient may also have atlanto-occipital and temporo-mandibular joint involvement as well. Cricoarytenoid cartilages involvement may result in upper airway compromise. Furthermore cervical spine vertebrae are prone to fractures, especially on hyperextension and may lead to spinal cord transection and quadriplegia. In this case report we describe the airway management of such patient with fixed rigidity of cervical spine and thoracolumbar kyphosis.",0,0
14977343,Management of unanticipated difficult intubation: a survey of current practice in the Oxford region,"Background and objective: Unanticipated difficulty in tracheal intubation in an anaesthetized patient has always been a cause of concern to anaesthesiologists. This difficulty may lead to morbidity and mortality. This survey was carried out to determine the technique commonly favoured in centres in the Oxford region in the UK for the management of unanticipated difficult intubation. Methods: We conducted a clinical scenario-based questionnaire survey of 181 anaesthesiologists in the Oxford region. In this scenario, difficulty in endotracheal intubation is recognized only after induction of anaesthesia. A number of options were available to deal with this situation. We used this scenario as a tool to gain insight into the training and the training needs of anaesthesiologists at various levels of training. Results: Of the 181 questionnaires sent, we received 143 (79%) completed replies. The vast majority (141/143 (99%)) of anaesthesiologists would use a gum-elastic bougie together with head and neck positioning and optimal external laryngeal manipulation to gain the best attempt at intubation. If intubation still failed, overall 129/143 (90%) had a back-up plan, while 14/143 (10%) had no plan. Flexible fibreoptic techniques were more commonly planned by 92/143 (64%) anaesthesiologists compared to blind techniques which were less commonly planned by 37/143 (26%) anaesthesiologists. Differences in choice of technique among anaesthesiologists in teaching and district general hospitals were not significant (P = 0.87). Overall, trainees were less likely to choose fibreoptic techniques compared to consultants (P = 0.0009) and would use blind techniques or ask a more experienced colleague to take over. The main reason for the choice was previous experience with the technique. Conclusions: Although fibreopric techniques were most commonly planned, these were less often chosen by trainees than consultants due to lack of experience/training, while unavailability of intubating laryngeal mask airway (Intavent) was an additional issue precluding its use as an adjunct to intubation.",0,0
8818105,[Difficult tracheal intubation and abnormal response to thiopental in a patient with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita],"Anesthesia was administered for six times to a patient with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) at the age of 10 to 17 years. In the first four occasions of anesthesia, difficult tracheal intubation was encountered due to limited neck extension, inadequate mouth opening and the short epiglottis. On the fifth anesthesia, the patient remained conscious even after intravenous injection of thiopental 6.6 mg.kg-1, and enflurane in combination with nitrous oxide was administered to induce anesthesia. During the induction of the sixth anesthesia, excessive oral secretion and severe continued nausea were observed just after intravenous administration of thiopental 5.3 mg.kg-1. These were overcome by intravenous administration of ketamine 2.0 mg.kg-1. Problems such as difficulty in tracheal intubation and abnormal response to thiopental need special attention in patients complicated with AMC, particularly during induction of anesthesia.",0,0
26599791,Development and Validation of a Morphologic Obstructive Sleep Apnea Prediction Score: The DES-OSA Score,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underdiagnosed entity that favors perioperative morbidity. Several anatomical characteristics predispose to OSA. We developed a new clinical score that would detect OSA based on the patient's morphologic characteristics only. Methods: Patients (n = 149) scheduled for an overnight polysomnography were included. Their morphologic metrics were compared, and combinations of them were tested for their ability to predict at least mild, moderate-to-severe, or severe OSA, as defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >5, >15, or >30 events/h. This ability was calculated using Cohen κ coefficient and prediction probability. Results: The score with best prediction abilities (DES-OSA score) considered 5 variables: Mallampati score, distance between the thyroid and the chin, body mass index, neck circumference, and sex. Those variables were weighted by 1, 2, or 3 points. DES-OSA score >5, 6, and 7 were associated with increased probability of an AHI >5, >15, or >30 events/h, respectively, and those thresholds had the best Cohen κ coefficient, sensitivities, and specificities. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve was 0.832 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.762-0.902), 0.805 (95% CI, 0.734-0.876), and 0.834 (95% CI, 0.757-0.911) for DES-OSA at predicting an AHI >5, >15, and >30 events/h, respectively. With the aforementioned thresholds, corresponding sensitivities (95% CI) were 82.7% (74.5-88.7), 77.1% (66.9-84.9), and 75% (61.0-85.1), and specificities (95% CI) were 72.4% (54.0-85.4), 73.2% (60.3-83.1), and 76.9% (67.2-84.4). Validation of DES-OSA performance in an independent sample yielded highly similar results. Conclusions: DES-OSA is a simple score for detecting OSA patients. Its originality relies on its morphologic nature. Derived from a European population, it may prove useful in a preoperative setting, but it has still to be compared with other screening tools in a general surgical population and in other ethnic groups.",0,0
19733476,"Difficult intubation during rapid sequence induction in a parturient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type","There have been several reports of resistance to local anaesthetic agents in women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type, also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type III. General anaesthesia with rapid sequence induction was performed for caesarean section due to prolonged second stage of labour, but intubation proved to be difficult. We propose that intubation difficulty probably arose from collapse of fibro-elastic tissues and adjoining C-shaped cartilages of the trachea with appropriately applied cricoid pressure. We found no other case reports of difficult intubation in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type. There are reports of cervical spine instability and temporomandibular joint dysfunction in patients with this syndrome suggesting a potential for difficult airway management. Additional anaesthetic problems associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome involve patient positioning and vascular access.",0,0
19532025,Review of adult tracheomalacia and its relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Purpose of review: This review summarizes the literature on adult or acquired tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) and explores its association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recent findings: Dynamic imaging of central airways, a noninvasive test as effective as bronchoscopy to diagnose TBM, has increased the recognition of this disorder. Airway stabilization techniques using stents placed via bronchoscopy have also furthered the interest in TBM. The association of TBM with COPD is of growing interest particularly in the face of worldwide rise in COPD incidence. The pathobiology behind this condition may share significant common ground with COPD. Summary: Despite the lack of uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria and the uncertain correlation to clinical manifestations and course, technologic advances in imaging and interventional bronchoscopy have spurred clinicians' interest in TBM. In exploring the association of TBM and COPD, an intriguing consideration is whether TBM could be an extension of peripheral airway disease.",0,0

17143427,Nasolaryngoscopy or laryngotracheoscopy: which is the best exam for assessing the airways of children?,"It is not uncommon to find children with respiratory distress. In these cases airway endoscopy is usually required. Doubts about which examination should be used are frequent. Aim: to establish which examination is the best to assess the airways of children. Material and methods: a retrospective study assessing 16 children with a history of respiratory distress at the Children Airway Unit of the Pediatric Otolaryngology Department at UNICAMP. All patients underwent nasolaryngoscopy and laryngotracheoscopy between March 2001 and March 2004. Data was analyzed and compared. Results: during this study 16 children were assessed; the most frequent indication of exams were: evaluation of prolonged tracheostomy in 10 patients (62%), and subglottic stenosis (31.3%). Conclusion: assessing airways in children with respiratory distress is essential for a diagnosis. In our study, we concluded that all children with upper airway disease must undergo nasolaryngoscopy, an easy, economic and useful exam that provides information about larynx function. However, if subglottic or traqueal disease issuspected, or if nasolaryngoscopy findings are in conflict with the physical examination, laryngotracheoscopy should be undertaken.",0,0
18499613,Cone beam computed tomography: an innovative tool for airway assessment,"Improvements in airway imaging technology provide the potential for an improved understanding of airway pathology and upper airway mechanics. We present here a preliminary report on the applicability of cone beam computed tomography technology in conjunction with multidimensional digital analysis for the purposes of clinical airway management. The use of this technology for airway imaging in anesthesiology has not been reported. Traditional skeletal and soft tissue images as well as distance and volume measurements were obtained without difficulty. Three-dimensional image reconstructions as well as ""virtual laryngoscopy"" were achieved with resulting excellent image quality, suggesting a broad range of possibilities for upper airway examination and analysis. A modified Muller test with volumetric rendering of the airway passages under baseline and negative pressure conditions was also performed, made possible as a result of the system's short (9 s) scanning times. We believe that cone beam computed tomography technology offers an additional dimension to airway evaluation that has considerable potential.",0,0
7668431,[Difficult intubation: nasotracheal tube cuff inflation as an aid to difficult intubation],"A case is reported of an unexpected difficult nasotracheal intubation for respiratory distress syndrome in a 72-yr-old obese woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After positioning the tip of the tracheal tube in the oropharynx, direct laryngoscopy did not allow exposure neither of the glottis nor of the corniculate cartilages. Fibreoptic tracheal intubation was decided. While preparing fibreoptic instruments, an attempt at blind intubation was performed. The tracheal tube cuff was inflated with 15 mL of air and then advanced gently until slight resistance was felt as the inflated cuff made contact with the vocal cords. At that time it was deflated and the tracheal tube advanced into the trachea. In the presence of normal pharyngeal anatomy, inflation of the tracheal tube cuff in the oropharynx is assumed to centre the tip of the tube and to direct it anteriorly towards the larynx. A recent prospective and randomized study has shown that tracheal tube cuff inflation in the oropharynx is effective in improving the success rate of blind nasotracheal intubation in paralysed patients with normal pharyngeal anatomy. Only case reports have shown the efficacy of tracheal tube cuff inflation in the pharynx as an aid to difficult blind nasotracheal intubation in emergency. Further controlled studies in this area would be valuable.",0,0
23332136,Role of virtual bronchoscopy in the evaluation of bronchial lesions: a pictorial essay,"Bronchoscopy is an important diagnostic method for the tracheobronchial, thoracic, and mediastinal lesions. It is limited by the physical progression of the bronchoscope. This represents a problem when assessing difficult airways, such as a lumen narrowed from any cause. Bronchoscopy can be performed with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB), which remains the best modality for the evaluation of endoluminal and mucosal lesions of the respiratory tract. However, FOB has important limitations. It cannot view structures outside the bronchial wall, such as the mediastinal lymph nodes and vascular structures. Additionally, FOB frequently provides little information about the extent of the extraluminal diseases or airway patency distal to high-grade bronchial stenosis. In view of these limitations, some authors have suggested that virtual bronchoscopy (VB) may replace FOB. VB is a novel computed tomography-based imaging technique. It allows a noninvasive intraluminal evaluation of the tracheobronchial tree. In addition to its direct roles in patient care, VB has great potential in education, bronchoscopy training, and procedure planning. VB can be performed when FOB is contraindicated or considered risky, as in cases with airway narrowing. Also, it can be done as a preliminary evaluation before FOB. VB is not effective for the detection of subtle mucosal abnormalities, such as erythema or early sessile lesions. The aim of this pectoral essay is to present overview of VB and the author's experience of using of VB, based on computed tomography data, in diagnosis of different tracheobronchial lesions.",0,0
24382623,Cuff pressure of endotracheal tubes after changes in body position in critically ill patients treated with mechanical ventilation,"Background: In order to avoid microaspiration and tracheal injury, the target for endotracheal tube cuff pressure is 20 to 30 cm H2O. Objective: To assess the effect of changes in body position on cuff pressure in adult patients. Methods: Twelve orally intubated and sedated patients received neuromuscular blockers and were positioned in a neutral starting position (backrest, head-of-bed elevation 30º, head in neutral position) with cuff pressure at 25 cm H2O. Then, 16 changes in position were performed: anteflexion head, hyperextension head, left and right lateral flexion of head, left and right rotation of the head, semirecumbent position (head-of-bed elevation 45°), recumbent position (head-of-bed elevation 10°), horizontal backrest, Trendelenburg position (10°), and left and right lateral positioning over 30°, 45°, and 90°. Once a patient was correctly positioned, cuff pressure was recorded during an end-expiratory ventilatory hold. The pressure observed was compared with the cuff pressure at the starting position. Values outside the target range (20-30 cm H2O) were considered clinically relevant. Results: A total of 192 measurements were performed (12 subjects × 16 positions). A significant deviation in cuff pressure occurred with all 16 changes (P < .05). No pressures were less than the lower limit (20 cm H2O). Pressures were greater than the upper limit (30 cm H2O) in 40.6% of the measurements. In each position, the upper target limit was exceeded at least once. Within-patient variability was substantial (P = .02). Conclusion: Simple changes in patients' positioning can result in potentially harmful cuff pressures.",0,0
1861569,Laser resistant stainless steel endotracheal tube: experimental and clinical evaluation,"A fire due to endotracheal tube (ET) ignition is a catastrophic event that may occur during laser surgery of the upper airway, regardless of the wavelength utilized. Although methods exist that permit laser surgery without an ET, this is frequently not feasible. The current investigation was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a double-cuffed stainless steel ET, first in the laboratory and subsequently in a clinical setting. Bench testing was performed using CO2 (both standard and milliwatt) and KTP/532 lasers. Only the distal polyvinyl chloride cuffed end of the tube was potentially ignitable, however, the appropriate use of saline to fill the cuffs allowed only for cuff perforation without ignition. Canine testing was performed in 10 animals: 4 dogs were intubated from 3 to 4.5 hours with the laser resistant stainless steel endotracheal tube (LRSS-ET) (Laser-Flex Tracheal Tube; Mallinckrodt Anesthesia Products, St. Louis, MO) and 2 with an aluminum tape wrapped red rubber ET. Visual and histological examination were performed in both groups at 3 and 7 days. Four dogs underwent CO2 laser laryngeal surgery with visual and histological examination performed at 7 days postoperatively. No untoward effects could be demonstrated due to the LRSS-ET. A clinical study was then performed in 24 patients who underwent laser surgery of the upper aerodigestive tract with either a CO2 or KTP/532 laser. In all cases ventilation was adequate, the shaft of the LRSS-ET proved impervious to the laser, and the distal end of the tube protected the tracheobronchial tree safely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0

22972566,"Comparison of effects of propofol and ketamine-propofol mixture (ketofol) on laryngeal mask airway insertion conditions and hemodynamics in elderly patients: a randomized, prospective, double-blind trial","Purpose: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of ketamine-propofol mixture (ketofol) and propofol on ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) insertion conditions and hemodynamics in elderly patients. Methods: Eighty elderly patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, were randomly divided into two groups to receive either propofol 0.15 ml/kg (n = 40), or ketofol (using a 1:1 single-syringe mixture of 5 mg/ml ketamine and 5 mg/ml propofol) (n = 40) before induction of anesthesia. Sixty seconds after induction, the PLMA was inserted. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure (systolic [S] BP) were recorded prior to the induction of anesthesia, immediately following induction, immediately after PLMA insertion, and 5 and 10 min after PLMA insertion. PLMA insertion conditions were scored according to mouth opening, swallowing, coughing, head and body motion, laryngospasm, and ease of PLMA insertion by the same experienced anesthesiologist, who did not know which agents were used. Results: There were no differences in PLMA insertion conditions between the groups. The number of patients in need of ephedrine (P = 0.043) and the total dose of ephedrine (P = 0.022) were significantly lower, and apnea duration (P < 0.001) was significantly higher in the ketofol group compared with the propofol group. SBP was significantly higher in the ketofol group than in the propofol group immediately after PLMA insertion and 5 min after PLMA insertion. Conclusions: The same PLMA insertion conditions were found with ketofol and propofol. The number of patients in need of ephedrine and the total ephedrine dose were lower and apnea duration was increased in the ketofol group.",0,0
23968655,"A combination of the modified Mallampati score, thyromental distance, anatomical abnormality, and cervical mobility (M-TAC) predicts difficult laryngoscopy better than Mallampati classification","Objective: Unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in anesthetized patients. A number of modules have been developed to predict difficult airways, but they are often complex in nature. We combined the modified Mallampati score (M), thyromental distance (T), anatomical abnormality (A), and cervical mobility (C) into a single scoring system with the acronym M-TAC, and evaluated it against Mallampati scoring. Methods: We prospectively analyzed 500 adult patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Preoperative airway assessments using M-TAC were performed, all of which were given a score. Anesthesiologists, blinded to the pre-anesthetic airway assessment, performed laryngoscopy and graded the laryngoscopic view as per Cormack and Lehane's classification. For the study purpose, difficult laryngoscopy was defined as Cormack and Lehane Grade 3 or 4 of laryngoscopic view. Results: An M-TAC score ≥ 4 had a significantly higher sensitivity (96% vs. 72%) and specificity (86% vs. 78%) with a high positive predictive value (44% vs. 28%) and a very low false negative value (2% vs. 15%) in comparison with Mallampati scoring (p < 0.05). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for predicting difficult laryngoscopy revealed an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI = 0.78-0.88) for Mallampati scoring and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.92-0.96) for M-TAC scoring system. Conclusion: The M-TAC scoring system has provided a higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in comparison with Mallampati classification.",1,1
11967682,Functional anatomy of the papilla Vateri: biomechanical aspects and impact of difficult endoscopic intubation,"Background: Problems with intubation of the ampulla Vateri during diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic maneuvers are a well-known feature. The ampulla Vateri was analyzed three-dimensionally to determine whether these difficulties have a structural background. Methods: Thirty-five human greater duodenal papillae were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy as well as immunohistochemically. Results: Histologically, highly vascularized finger-like mucosal folds project far into the lumen of the ampulla Vateri. The excretory ducts of seromucous glands containing many lysozyme-secreting Paneth cells open close to the base of the mucosal folds. Scanning electron microscopy revealed large mucosal folds inside the ampulla that continued into the pancreatic and bile duct, comparable to valves arranged in a row. Conclusions: Mucosal folds form pocket-like valves in the lumen of the ampulla Vateri. They allow a unidirectional flow of secretions into the duodenum and prevent reflux from the duodenum into the ampulla Vateri. Subepithelial mucous gland secretions functionally clean the valvular crypts and protect the epithelium. The arrangement of pocket-like mucosal folds may explain endoscopic difficulties experienced when attempting to penetrate the papilla of Vater during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticographic procedures.",0,0
23153175,A randomised comparison of InnoScope and Macintosh laryngoscope in simulated difficult tracheal intubation in manikins,"We conducted a crossover randomised study to evaluate the performance of a novel optical stylet, the InnoScope, for tracheal intubation in simulated normal and difficult airways. Twenty-five anaesthetists attempted tracheal intubation on a SimMan 3G simulator using the InnoScope first followed by the Macintosh laryngoscope or vice versa. Three airway scenarios were tested: (1) normal airway; (2) difficult airway with swollen pharynx; and (3) limited neck movement. In each scenario, the laryngeal view, duration of and success rate for tracheal intubation were recorded. Compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, the use of InnoScope increased the percentage of glottic opening seen by 17% in normal airway, 23% in the difficult airway and 32% with limited neck movement, p < 0.01. Despite this better laryngeal view, successful tracheal intubation achieved with the InnoScope (88.0%) was lower than that for the Macintosh laryngoscope (98.7%), p = 0.008. Using the InnoScope, tracheal intubation during the first attempt was only successful in 48% of cases with difficult airway. In this scenario, the median (interquartile range [range]) duration of tracheal intubation was significantly longer with [corrected] InnoScope compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, (70 (19-120 [15-120)] s vs 30 [21-58 (15-120)] s, [corrected] p = 0.01. We conclude that an improved laryngeal view with the use of the InnoScope did not translate into better conditions for tracheal intubation.",0,0
20021804,[Airway obstruction caused by large blood vessel anomalies: assessment by flexible bronchoscopy],"Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic value and safety of flexible bronchoscopy in congenital great vessel diseases complicated with airway compression. Method: The medical records of patients with great vessels abnormalities who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from October 2005 to June 2009 were retrospectively reviewed; 34 cases were diagnosed as airway compression by flexible bronchoscopy, 10 cases as vascular ring, 24 cases as aortal arch obstruction. The age of the patients was 6 d - 11 m, body weight 2.2 - 8.7 kg [(4.6 +/- 1.4) kg]. Recorded airway abnormalities detected by bronchoscopy and CT, cardiac vascular defects and airway compression were consistent with the findings on operation. The relation between the airway compression and cardiac vascular abnormalities, treatment of the airway compression and outcome were analysed. Result: Bronchoscopic assessment was successfully performed in NICU or operating room for all the patients. (1) Initial presentation of the 34 cases were tachypnea, stridor, refractory lung infection and prolonged mechanical ventilation. (2) Extrinsic compression was found in all the 10 cases with vascular ring by bronchoscopy initially which indicated vascular ring, airway compression was mainly of lower part of trachea. Diagnosis of 9 cases was consistent with CT diagnosis and in 1 case the diagnosis was confirmed by surgery; among these cases, 7 had congenital tracheal stenosis. (3) In the 24 cases with aortic obstructive lesion, 5 were detected to have tracheal stenosis by CT before correction of vascular abnormality, among whom one case was indicated to have tracheal stenosis by bronchoscopy, the other 19 cases were found with airway compression by bronchoscopy during or after vascular correction. Among the 24 cases, 21 had left main bronchial stenosis, 2 had congenital tracheal stenosis. Airway compression diagnosed by bronchoscopy agreed with the findings of CT. Two cases developed transient decrease of oxygen saturation, 5 cases developed transient tachycardia. Conclusion: Flexible bronchoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the airway compression complicated with great vessel abnormalities. Bronchoscopy is an accurate, convenient, safe and rapid way for airway assessment, but further examination of the peripheral structure and vascular malformation need combined examination with CT.",0,0
2773884,Fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the treatment of intubated neonates,"A study of the role of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in intubated neonates was conducted. The study aimed to ascertain the applicability of fiberoptic bronchoscopy for assessment of endotracheal tube tip position, and to assess the incidence and clinical significance of airway disease in unselected patients. Seventy examinations on 65 neonates were performed without interruption of mechanical ventilation. The procedure was well tolerated in all cases. The accuracy of bronchoscopic measurement of endotracheal tube tip position improved markedly with user experience and reached a correlation of .96 with a chest roentgenogram. Although the technique was safe and accurate, the need for available and skilled personnel may limit the applicability of this method for endotracheal tube tip position assessment. Significant airway disease requiring a change in treatment was found in 13 patients (19%). This high incidence of significant but clinically unsuspected airway disease suggests that there should be more frequent consideration of diagnostic bronchoscopy in all sick intubated neonates who are at risk for airway disease.",0,0
2719227,[The Tube-Stat: a useful aid in difficult intubation],"A patient (ASA class I) scheduled for an elective gynecological operation, could not be intubated by conventional means, as no part of the glottis could be seen on direct laryngoscopy. Endotracheal intubation was successful on the first attempt using a lighted intubation stylet (Tube-Stat, Concept Corporation, Clearwater, Florida, USA). Transillumination of the neck tissues acted as a guide for correct placement of the endotracheal tube. Postoperatively, the patient complained of hoarseness and sore throat that cleared up completely within 5 days. Cases of difficult-intubation are often impossible to recognize preoperatively [3]. When problems arise, a difficult-intubation drill should be instituted without delay. The view obtained at laryngoscopy in our patient corresponded to a Grade III case according to the classification of Cormack and Lehane [3]. Our usual routine in such cases calls for blind intubation using a flexible introducer passed posteriorly to the epiglottis or blind nasal intubation. Recent reports testify to the potential dangers of blind procedures [4, 19, 23]. Light-wand-guided intubation has been reported to be an easily learned, atraumatic alternative to laryngoscopic or blind nasal intubation [6, 9]. We employed the Tube-Stat light-wand in a series of routine surgical cases with encouraging results. Our case report documents our first patient intubated with the light-wand after failure of conventional larnygoscopy. The first lighted stylet was described some 30 years ago, and the method of transillumination as an aid in difficult intubation developed over the following years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
16774820,Bronchoscopic balloon dilatation in the management of bronchial stenosis following lung transplantation,"Background: Bronchial stenosis (BS) is currently found in 7-15% of lung transplantation (LT) recipients. Current treatment strategies have included Nd:Yag laser, cryotherapy, bougie dilatation and stent placement. Bronchoscopic balloon dilatation has been used as alternative treatment in a few cases with controversial results. This is a study to prospectively assess the efficacy of bronchoscopic balloon dilatation as a first step in the management of post-LT BS. Methods: From January 1995 to December 2002, bronchoscopic balloon dilatation was evaluated as first therapeutic option in all consecutive LT patients with BS. Symptoms, pulmonary function tests, airway diameter and use of other therapeutic techniques were evaluated. Results: A total of 10 out of 284 anastomed airways (3.5%) in 9 out of 152 LT patients were included in the study and follow-up lasted from 6 to 81 months. Dilatation of all but one BS met with initial success: increase of both luminal dimensions and forced vital capacity (P=0.01), and relief of symptoms. Bronchoscopic balloon dilatation long-term follow-up showed effective results in 5 out of 10 (50%) bronchial stenoses, after an average of 4 bronchoscopic balloon dilatation procedures (range 1-8). No severe complications were observed. Stent placement was required in the other 5 bronchial stenoses. Conclusions: Bronchoscopic balloon dilatation is a safe method that should be considered as first therapeutic treatment of post-LT BS. Its use avoids the need for stent placement in up to 50% of cases.",0,0
25425705,Evaluation of an automated endotracheal tube cuff controller during simulated mechanical ventilation,"Background: Maintaining endotracheal tube cuff pressure within a narrow range is an important factor in patient care. The goal of this study was to evaluate the IntelliCuff against the manual technique for maintaining cuff pressure during simulated mechanical ventilation with and without movement. Methods: The IntelliCuff was compared to the manual technique of a manometer and syringe. Two independent studies were performed during mechanical ventilation: part 1, a 2-h trial incorporating continuous mannikin head movement; and part 2, an 8-h trial using a stationary trachea model. We set cuff pressure to 25 cm H2O, PEEP to 10 cm H2O, and peak inspiratory pressures to 20, 30, and 40 cm H2O. Clinical importance was defined as both statistically significant (P<.05) and clinically significant (pressure change [Δ]>10%). Results: In part 1, the change in cuff pressure from before to after ventilation was clinically important for the manual technique (P<.001, Δ=-39.6%) but not for the IntelliCuff (P=.02, Δ=3.5%). In part 2, the change in cuff pressure from before to after ventilation was clinically important for the manual technique (P=.004, Δ=-14.39%) but not for the IntelliCuff (P=.20, Δ=5.65%). Conclusions: There was a clinically important drop in manually set cuff pressure during simulated mechanical ventilation in a stationary model and an even larger drop with movement, but this was significantly reduced by the IntelliCuff in both scenarios. Additionally, we observed that cuff pressure varied directly with inspiratory airway pressure for both techniques, leading to elevated average cuff pressures.",0,0

10193214,The relevance of clinical and radiological measurements in predicting difficulties in fibreoptic orotracheal intubation in adults,"Resistance to the passage of the tracheal tube has been reported to occur in up to 36% of patients subjected to orotracheal fibreoptic intubation. In this prospective study we assessed five radiological measurements of the upper airway in an attempt to find anatomical causes of obstruction to passage of the tube. Forty-nine patients undergoing fibreoptic orotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia were studied. Pre-operatively, the Mallampati grade and the thyromental distance were assessed. The plain films, CT scans or MR images of the cervical spine were used for measurement of the position of the vocal cords, the length of the epiglottis and the size of the tongue. The resistance to the passage of the tube was graded as none, mild, moderate or severe. The length of the epiglottis and the size of the tongue, but not the position of the vocal cords, had positive correlations with the severity of impingement. The pre-operative bedside tests did not correlate with difficulties in fibreoptic intubation.",0,0
11056743,Balloon laryngoscopy reduces head extension and blade leverage in patients with potential cervical spine injury,"Background: Head extension and excessive laryngoscope blade levering motion (LBLM) are undesirable during airway management of trauma patients. We hypothesized that laryngoscopy with a modified blade facilitating glottic exposure by balloon inflation would reduce head extension and LBLM. Patients and methods: Seventeen elective surgery patients were enrolled. Patients lay supine with their heads flat on a rigid board and had a rigid collar around their necks. Laryngoscopy was performed with the modified blade and a standard curved blade. Head extension and LBLM angles were determined upon maximal glottic exposure and compared used paired t-tests. Laryngoscopic view grade and oxygen saturation were also determined. Results: Balloon laryngoscopy resulted in less head extension and LBLM (P <0.001). Laryngoscopic view was approximately identical with both blades, and oxygen saturation was always above 97%.

We report the use of a lighted stylet to facilitate tracheal intubation in 2 patients in whom laryngoscopy with a videolaryngoscope was difficult. Case 1: A 52-year-old female with loose teeth and lockjaw presented for a scoliosis surgery under general anesthesia. Laryngoscopy using a blade 3 of a Glide-Scope® (Laerdal Medical Corporation, New York, NY, USA) videolaryngoscope (GVL) showed a Cormack-Lehanne grade 3 view. Bag mask ventilation was easily achieved. By using the Trachilight™ (Saturn Biomedical System Burnaby, BC, Canada) with the GVL, we could intubate the trachea succesfully. Case 2: A 16-year-old male with a history of difficult tracheal intubation due to a limited cervical spine movement presented for an external fixation of a femur under general anesthesia. After induction of anaesthesia, bag mask ventilation was easily achieved but the GVL laryngoscopy did not provide a good view of the glottis (Cormack-Lehanne grade 3). Combined use of the Trachilight™ with the GVL, facilitated tracheal intubation. The Trachilight™ is a recognized aid to facilitate trachal intubation but the device is now commercially not available. Neverthless, we believe that a lighted stylet is potentially useful for tracheal intubation when the view of the glottis with a videolaryngoscopy is not ideal.",0,0
19700052,Airway management in the obese patient,"Airway management is a major factor underlying morbidity and mortality in the obese population. The validity of anthropomorphic prediction model in assessing a difficult airway is less accurate compared with lean subjects. Preoperative evaluation and anticipation of potential complications are critical for safe and successful intubation. Application of noninvasive positive airway pressure can prevent atelectasis and improve oxygenation during the anesthetic induction as well during the postoperative period and after liberation from mechanical ventilation. When performed by trained operators, bedside percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy in obese patients has a safety profile comparable to surgical tracheostomy but provides advantages including ease of performance and lesser cost, and obviates transporting a critically ill patient outside the intensive care unit.",0,0

25885730,Comparison between different tests and their combination for prediction of difficult intubation: An analytical study,"Context: There is an impelling need for accurate tests to predict difficult intubation, as failure to achieve endotracheal intubation causes significant morbidity and mortality in anesthetic practice. Aim: To calculate the validity of the different tests along with their combination and agreement when compared with endotracheal intubation in predicting difficult intubation. Settings and design: Operation theaters, analytical study. Materials and methods: Three hundred patients aged between 16 and 60 years of American society of anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I and II, scheduled for elective surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation were studied during January-July 2012. Mallampati grade (MP), sternomental distance (SMD), thyromental distance (TMD), and Delilkan and Calder test were recorded for every patient. Endotracheal intubation was performed by an experienced anesthesiologist blinded to the measurements and recorded grading of intubation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR), odds ratio (OR), and kappa coefficient of tests individually and in combination were calculated. Statistical analysis used: IBM SPSS software (version 16.0) and Epi-info software (version 3.2). Results: Difficult and failed intubation was 13.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Difficult intubation increased with age. TMD and Calder test showed highest sensitivity individually and Dellilkan's test showed least sensitivity. Among the combination of tests, MP with SMD and MP with Calder test had the highest sensitivity. Conclusion: Among individual test TMD and Calder are better predictive tests in terms of sensitivity. Combination of tests increases the chance of prediction of difficult intubation.",1,1
9054250,Predicting difficult intubation with indirect laryngoscopy,"Background: It is not always possible to predict when tracheal intubation will be difficult or impossible. The authors wanted to determine whether indirect laryngoscopy could identify patients in whom intubation was difficult. Methods: Indirect laryngoscopy was done in 2,504 patients. The Wilson risk sum score and the modified Mallampati score were also studied in a different series of 3,680 patients for comparison. These predictive methods were compared according to three parameters: positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: Of 6,184 patients studied, the trachea proved difficult to intubate in 82 (1.3%). Positive predictive value (31%) and specificity (98.4%) with indirect laryngoscopy were greater than the other two predictive methods (P < 0.01), whereas sensitivity with indirect laryngoscopy (69.2%) was greater than that of the Wilson risk sum score (55.4%) (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Although in 15% of patients indirect laryngoscopy could not be performed because of excessive gag reflex, indirect laryngoscopy can serve as an effective method to predict difficult intubation.",1,1
26437554,[Rapid Sequence Intubation with the McGRATH MAC Videolaryngoscope in the Sitting Position for a Patient with Restricted Mouth Opening],"Here we report successful rapid-sequence inubation with the McGRATH MAC videolaryngscope (McGRATH) in the face to face sitting position for a patient with severe ileus and restricted mouse opening. A 46-year-old woman with advanced bladder cancer had developed ileus. Ileus tube and octreotide did not relieve her symptoms, and emergency colostomy was planned. Due to the invasion of cancer to the spine and interior of the pelvis, she could not keep supine position and always kept sitting position. We decided to perform rapid-sequence intubation in the sitting position. First an anesthesiologist stood at face to face position to the patients, and the second anesthesiologist kept the head of the patient from the cranial side. After thiamylal and fentanyl administration, cricoid pressure was applied by the third anesthesiologist. Under the guide of the McGRATH's monitor, we could successfully insert the 7.0 mm internal diameter tracheal tube with a stylet uneventfully in the face to face sitting position.",0,0
26194909,Anesthetic management of pediatric patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome: our experience and a review of the literature,"Introduction: Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare sporadic congenital neurocutaneous syndrome which is characterized by vascular malformation involving the brain, face and eye. The anesthetic management is complicated by its localized as well as systemic manifestations, associated anomalies and difficult airway due to the presence of angiomas of the oral cavity and airway. We retrospective analyzed the perioperative anesthetic management of children with SWS undergoing ophthalmic surgery and reviewed the literature. Methods: Medical records and anesthetic charts of all the children with SWS who had undergone an ophthalmic procedure under general anesthesia during the past 6 years were reviewed. Information related to the demographic profile, preoperative evaluation, anesthetic techniques, and perioperative complications were collected and analyzed. Results: Forty children with SWS received general anesthesia for an ophthalmic procedure within the 6-year period. The median age of the children was 3 years. 30 (92.5%) children had facial port-wine staining, 10 (25%) had facial hypertrophy, 15 (37.5%) had a history of convulsion and 4 (10%) children had mental retardation. Inhalational induction was performed in 34 (85%) children (sevoflurane 82.8%). A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and endotracheal tube were used in 32 (80%) and 5 (12.5%) cases, respectively. One patient had difficult mask ventilation and difficult LMA insertion. There was no significant problem in any of the other children. Conclusion: Preoperative evaluation with airway assessment should be performed with the knowledge of local and systemic manifestation of the syndrome. Proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties of the anesthetics, as well as drug interactions of antiepileptic medications should be considered when planning anesthesia. Avoiding a rise in intracranial and intraocular pressures, vigilant intraoperative monitoring and postoperative care are the key for conducting safe anesthesia in these children. For ophthalmic procedures, LMAs can be used for airway maintenance with minimal complications in children with SWS.",0,0
19786222,Proposal for staging airway hemangiomas,"Objective: To describe a method of airway infantile hemangioma staging using standardized assessment of airway narrowing, and hemangioma location and volume, as determined with endoscopy and CT angiography. Study design: Case series with chart review. Setting: Tertiary pediatric hospital, 2003-2008. Subjects and methods: Subjects included airway hemangioma patients evaluated at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Data collected were age at first symptoms, diagnostic evaluation, percent airway compromise, and estimated hemangioma volume. Data were analyzed with descriptive and Fisher exact statistics. Results: Twelve patients were identified and seven had complete data sets. Mean age at first symptoms was 1.9 months (SD 1.09 months, range 0.5-4 months). Evaluation consisted of nasopharyngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy, CT angiography, and/or MRI. Mean laryngeal airway narrowing was estimated at 63.75 percent (SD 19.0%, range 40%-90%). Total hemangioma volume was less in patients with isolated (focal) endolaryngeal hemangiomas compared with airway hemangiomas associated with extralaryngeal (segmental) hemangiomas. Airway hemangioma stages were stage one (5 of 12; 41.6%), stage two (6 of 12; 50.0%), and stage three (1 of 12; 8.3%). Conclusion: This method of airway hemangioma staging may be applicable to treatment planning and used to measure treatment outcomes.",0,0
15960405,"Randomized double-blind comparison of ketamine-propofol, fentanyl-propofol and propofol-saline on haemodynamics and laryngeal mask airway insertion conditions","The aim of this prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was to investigate whether the administration of ketamine before induction with propofol improves its associated haemodynamic profile and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion conditions. Ninety adult patients were randomly allocated to receive either ketamine 0.5 mg x kg(-1) (n = 30), fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1) (n = 30) or normal saline (n = 30), before induction of anaesthesia with propofol 2.5 mg x kg(-1). Insertion of the LMA was performed 60s after injection of propofol. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured before induction (baseline), immediately after induction, immediately before LMA insertion, immediately after LMA insertion and every minute for three minutes after LMA insertion. Following LMA insertion, the following six subjective endpoints were graded by a blinded anaesthestist using ordinal scales graded 1 to 3: mouth opening, gagging, swallowing, movement, laryngospasm and ease of insertion. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher following ketamine than either fentanyl (P = 0.010) or saline (P = 0.0001). The median (interquartile range) summed score describing the overall insertion conditions were similar in the ketamine [median 7.0, interquartile range (6.0-8.0)] and fentanyl groups [median 7.0, interquartile range (6.0-8.0)]. Both appeared significantly better than the saline group [median 8.0, interquartile range (6.75-9.25); P = 0.024]. The incidence of prolonged apnoea (> 120s) was higher in the fentanyl group [23.1% (7/30)] compared with the ketamine [6.3% (2/30)] and saline groups [3.3% (1/30)]. We conclude that the addition of ketamine 0.5 mg x kg(-1) improves haemodynamics when compared to fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1), with less prolonged apnoea, and is associated with better LMA insertion conditions than placebo (saline).",0,0
18613935,Management of an unusual pediatric difficult airway using ketamine as a sole agent,We present the case of a 9-year-old boy who suffered a fall while brushing his teeth. This resulted in impalement of the lateral pharyngeal wall by the toothbrush with its head becoming firmly lodged adjacent to the internal carotid artery as demonstrated by CT scan. The length of the toothbrush protruding from the mouth and the inability to adequately assess the airway prior to any intervention gave rise to a unique set of surgical and anesthetic airway management problems. These were compounded by the possibility of damage to the carotid artery and potential catastrophic hemorrhage with manipulation of the toothbrush at any point. We detail the problems and outline our management.,0,0
10652936,[Fastrach laryngeal mask and difficult intubation],"Objective: To evaluate the success rate of intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask airway (LMA-Fastrach) in patients with predictive signs of difficult airway or after intubation failure. Study design: Open prospective study. Patients: The study included 33 adults, 21 with predictive signs of difficult airway and 12 after intubation failure. Methods: After induction of anaesthesia, the intubating LMA was inserted. Proper insertion was confirmed by easy bag ventilation and capnography. Intubation through the intubating LMA was then carried out with an armoured endotracheal tube. If intubation failed, a second attempt was carried out after a gentle manipulation of the intubating LMA. After two attempts, if intubation remained impossible, fibrescopic intubation through the intubating LMA was carried out. In case of failure the usual tracheal intubation algorithms were used. Results: Tracheal intubation through the intubating LMA was successful in all patients, in 32 on the first attempt and in one on the second. Successful tracheal intubation was possible on the first attempt in 25 patients (76%), on the second in four (12%) and after fibrescopic intubation through the intubating LMA in the four remaining (12%). Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that tracheal intubation through the intubating LMA can be recommended in patients with a difficult airway, whether foreseen or not.",0,0
21530222,Recovery of polypropylene and polyethylene from packaging plastic wastes without contamination of chlorinated plastic films by the combination process of wet gravity separation and ozonation,"Wet gravity separation technique has been regularly practiced to separate the polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) (light plastic films) from chlorinated plastic films (CP films) (heavy plastic films). The CP films including poly vinyl chloride (PVC) and poly vinylidene chloride (PVDC) would float in water even though its density is more than 1.0g/cm(3). This is because films are twisted in which air is sometimes entrapped inside the twisted CP films in real existing recycling plant. The present research improves the current process in separating the PP and PE from plastic packaging waste (PPW), by reducing entrapped air and by increasing the hydrophilicity of the CP films surface with ozonation. The present research also measures the hydrophilicity of the CP films. In ozonation process mixing of artificial films up to 10min reduces the contact angle from 78° to 62°, and also increases the hydrophilicity of CP films. The previous studies also performed show that the artificial PVDC films easily settle down by the same. The effect of ozonation after the wet gravity separation on light PPW films obtained from an actual PPW recycling plant was also evaluated. Although actual light PPW films contained 1.3% of CP films however in present case all the CP films were removed from the PPW films as a settled fraction in the combination process of ozonation and wet gravity separation. The combination process of ozonation and wet gravity separation is the more beneficial process in recovering of high purity PP and PE films from the PPW films.",0,0
10195546,Comparison of sevoflurane with propofol for laryngeal mask airway insertion in adults,"We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare the quality and ease of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion after either rapid inhaled sevoflurane or i.v. propofol induction of anesthesia. Seventy-six unpremedicated ASA physical status I or II patients were anesthetized with either a single vital capacity breath of sevoflurane 8% or i.v. propofol 3 mg/kg, which produced equally rapid loss of consciousness (40.5 +/- 13.9 vs 37.7 +/- 9.9 s; P > 0.05). The LMA was inserted more rapidly in patients in the propofol group (74 +/- 29 vs 127 +/- 35 s; P < 0.01) and required fewer attempts (1.2 vs 1.6; P < 0.05) than the sevoflurane group. There was a greater incidence of initially impossible mouth opening in the sevoflurane group (45% vs 21%; P < 0.05). Once mouth opening was possible, the degree of attenuation of laryngeal reflexes was similar. The overall incidence of complications related to LMA insertion, especially apnea (32% vs 0%; P < 0.01), was more frequent in the propofol group (82% vs 26%; P < 0.01). There were four failures of LMA insertion in the propofol group and none in the sevoflurane group. Both groups had stable hemodynamic profiles and good patient satisfaction. We conclude that sevoflurane vital capacity breath induction compares favorably with i.v. propofol induction for LMA insertion in adults. However, prolonged jaw tightness after the sevoflurane induction of anesthesia may delay LMA insertion. Implications: In this randomized, controlled trial, we compared the ease of insertion of the laryngeal mask airway in adults after induction of anesthesia with either a sevoflurane vital capacity breath technique or propofol i.v.. We conclude that sevoflurane compares favorably with propofol, although prolonged jaw tightness may delay laryngeal mask airway insertion.",0,0
20007793,"Mallampati class changes during pregnancy, labour, and after delivery: can these be predicted?","Background: An increase in Mallampati class is associated with difficult laryngoscopy in obstetrics. The goal of our study was to determine the changes in Mallampati class before, during, and after labour, and to identify predictive factors of the changes. Methods: Mallampati class was evaluated at four time intervals in 87 pregnant patients: during the 8th month of pregnancy (T(1)), placement of epidural catheter (T(2)), 20 min after delivery (T(3)), and 48 h after delivery (T(4)). Factors such as gestational weight gain, duration of first and second stages of labour, and i.v. fluids administered during labour were evaluated for their predictive value. Mallampati classes 3 and 4 were compared for each time interval. Logistic regression was used to test the association between each factor and Mallampati class evolution. Results: Mallampati class did not change for 37% of patients. The proportion of patients falling into Mallampati classes 3 and 4 at the various times of assessment were: T(1), 10.3%; T(2), 36.8%; T(3), 51.7%; and T(4), 20.7%. The differences in percentages were all significant (P<0.01). None of the evaluated factors was predictive. Conclusions: The incidence of Mallampati classes 3 and 4 increases during labour compared with the pre-labour period, and these changes are not fully reversed by 48 h after delivery. This work confirms the absolute necessity of examining the airway before anaesthetic management in obstetric patients.",0,0
21478740,The child with facial abnormalities,"Purpose of review: The aim of this review is to outline the priorities in the anaesthetic management of the child with facial abnormalities. It presents a practical approach to this, based on the anatomical site of the deformity and degree of mouth opening. Recent findings: The literature reviewed primarily consists of case reports and series describing anaesthesia in children with relevant syndromes. Also scrutinized is the literature examining the role and effectiveness of recently developed airway management equipment. Summary: This is a challenging area of anaesthetic practice but the use of a structured approach, combined with supraglottic airway devices and fibre-optic and indirect laryngoscopic equipment, has allowed the safe administration of anaesthesia to almost all children with conditions resulting in facial abnormality.",0,0
2317394,The Brain laryngeal mask. An alternative to difficult intubation,"We report the case of a young man undergoing fixation of bilateral mandibular fractures, where the anaesthetist was unable to intubate. A Brain laryngeal mask was employed, thus enabling surgery to proceed. This relatively new device enabled the airway to be safeguarded whilst preserving reasonable surgical access for the attachment of Erich arch bars and a four hole osteosynthetic bone plate. The surgical and anaesthetic procedures are summarised. The laryngeal mask is described and its performance and limitations are discussed. We believe this to be the first report of mandibular fracture fixation performed with a Brain laryngeal mask in situ.",0,0
20051067,Complications associated with anesthesia administration for dental treatment in a special needs clinic,"The goal of this study was to identify and quantify complications occurring with the administration of anesthesia for the dental treatment of patients with special needs. Anesthesia providers completed a standardized evaluation form, delineating possible complications for 202 consecutive ambulatory patients receiving anesthesia in a special needs clinic. Statistical analysis of four types of administered anesthesia showed that the overall complication rate was 23.8%. Evaluation of the data showed complications that were considered either mild (95.8%), or moderate (4.2%), while no reports of severe complications occurred. Airway obstruction and nausea/vomiting were the most frequently encountered complications. Variables found to affect the incidence of anesthetic complications included ASA classification, anesthetic technique, Mallampati airway classification, and type of dental procedure performed. An evaluation of the results of the study showed that the majority of complications that occurred with anesthesia during care of patients with special needs were mild and did not lead to severe adverse events. Our findings show that anesthesia administered during dental treatment for patients with special needs is safe and effective.",0,0
22288931,Comparison of malleable stylet and reusable and disposable bougies by paramedics in a simulated difficult intubation,"In a randomised crossover study, 60 ambulance paramedics attempted tracheal intubation of a manikin model of a Cormack and Lehane grade 3/4 view using a Portex stylet, Portex and Frova single-use bougies, and a Portex reusable bougie. Tracheal intubation within 30 s was achieved by 34/60 (57%) using the stylet, 18/60 (30%) using a Portex single-use bougie, 16/60 (27%) using a Frova single-use bougie and 5/60 (8%) using a Portex reusable bougie. The proportion intubating within 30 s was significantly higher with the stylet compared with any bougie (p < 0.001), but significantly lower with a Portex reusable bougie than any other device (p < 0.004). Participants rated the Portex reusable bougie as significantly more difficult to use than the other devices (p < 0.001). There was no evidence of a relationship between previous experience and success rate for any device.",0,0
18277560,[Anesthetic management of patients with tracheal bronchus],"The incidence of a tracheal bronchus supplying the right upper lobe has been reported to be in the range of 0.1 to 3%. We encountered 3 cases with the anomaly among 200 cases of lung surgery conducted over a year at our hospital. In the first case, we had difficulty in intubating the patient with a double-lumen tube. In the other two cases, the tracheal bronchus was detected by fiberoptic bronchoscopy during the lung surgery. Patients with a tracheal bronchus may be difficult or impossible to ventilate, especially when requiring unilateral lung ventilation. Therefore, the airway must be assessed carefully by fiberoptic bronchoscopy prior to unilateral lung surgery, keeping in mind the possibility of a tracheal bronchus, in order to design a safe way to secure it safely during the surgery.",0,0
26618592,Cytological evaluation of tracheal aspirate and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid in comparison to endoscopic assessment of lower airways in horses with recurrent airways obstruction or inflammatory airway disease,"The aim of the present study was to compare the grade of discharge accumulation in the tracheal lumen, area of tracheal bifurcation, main bronchi and the tracheal septum thickness with the cytology of the tracheal aspirate (TA) and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in horses with recurrent airways obstruction and inflammatory airway disease from those horses. This study was conducted on 96 horses with RAO, 139 horses with IAD and 10 control horses. In all the horses, both clinical and endoscopic examinations were performed. During endoscopy, a score of mucus accumulation was estimated in 3/4 lower of the trachea and in the tracheal bifurcation. In addition, thickening of the tracheal septum was also assessed; tracheal aspirates and broncho-alveolar lavage were performed. An estimate of cell percentage was done in TA and BALF samples. In horses suffering from RAO and IAD, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of neutrophils and the accumulation of discharge, and in the IAD group, there was a negative correlation between the percentage of eosinophils and the accumulation of discharge. There was no correlation between tracheal septum thickening and the percentage of neutrophils and/or eosinophils.",0,0
9158352,Bronchoscopy via a redesigned Combitube in the esophageal position. A clinical evaluation,"Background: The esophageal-tracheal Combitube (Kendall-Sheridan Catheter Corp., Argyle, NY) is an effective device for providing adequate gas exchange. However, tracheal suctioning is impossible with the Combitube placed in the esophageal position. To eliminate this disadvantage, the Combitube was redesigned by creating an enlarged hole in the pharyngeal lumen that allows fiberoptic access, tracheal suctioning, and tube exchange over a guide wire. Methods: The two anterior, proximal perforations of regular Combitubes were replaced by a larger, ellipsoid-shaped hole. After the study was approved by the institutional review board, 20 patients with normal airways (Mallampati I or II) were studied. During general anesthesia, patients were esophageally intubated with the Combitube. A flexible bronchoscope was inserted and guided via the modified hole and glottic opening down the trachea. For the replacement procedure, a J tip guide wire was introduced through the bronchoscope. The bronchoscope and the Combitube were removed and a standard endotracheal tube was advanced over a guide catheter. Results: Bronchoscopic evaluation of the trachea and guided replacement of the Combitube by an endotracheal tube was successful in all 20 study patients. The average time needed to perform airway exchange was 90 +/- 20 s (mean +/- SD). Arterial oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels remained normal in all patients. No case of laryngeal trauma was observed during intubation or the airway exchange procedure. Conclusions: The redesigned Combitube enables fiberoptic bronchoscopy, fine-tuning of its position in the esophagus, and guided airway exchange in patients with normal airways. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate its value in patients with abnormal airways.",0,0
21714913,Examination of submental space as an alternative method of airway assessment (submental sign),"Background: Difficult airway especially failed intubation has been associated with a high incidence of mortality and morbidity. Most of mortalities occur when an anaesthesiologist encounters an unanticipated difficult airway. Findings: In 1999, a 23 yr. old, 65 kg weight and 170 cm height female patient had been scheduled for arthroscopy. Despite totally normal airway assessment (thyromental distance, mouth opening, jaw and neck movement ...) I was astonished by encountering a grade IV Cormack - Lehane laryngoscopic view. Tracheal intubation was impossible and ventilation was very difficult.On attempt to attain a better laryngoscopic view, while manipulating submandibular region I encountered a bulky noncompliant submental space (Submental Sign). This event made me more alert regarding this finding. Thereafter I noted for this sign throughout the past years and I found it very helpful.These findings encouraged me to write this report, and suggest a routine examination of submental space in order to keep the safety of the patient at the heart of the care we provide. Conclusion: Evaluation of the submental space is suggested as an alternative predictor of difficult airway and routine examination of the submental space is of value in airway assessment.",0,0

17335012,Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy in children with heart diseases: a twelve years experience,"In children, cardiac diseases and respiratory disorders are tightly linked entities whose evaluation should be performed integrally. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) presents a diagnostic and therapeutic role by assessing the airway anatomically, dynamically, and through the performance of several procedures. The present study describes our experience on FB assessment in children with congenital and acquired cardiac diseases, providing a characterization of the principal demographic and clinical features. Records of 72 patients under 14 years (mean age 21 months) with heart diseases, corresponding to 104 FB performed between January 1993 and October 2004 were reviewed. The principal cardiac diseases were left-to-right shunt (51.9%), followed by right-to-left shunt (17.3%) and miscellaneous cardiopathies (8.7%). The main indications for FB assessment were study of atelectasis (35%), stridor (14%), and pneumonia (14%). Airway malacias, as a group, were the commonest finding, represented mainly by left main bronchus malacia (24%). The second most common finding was stenosis by extrinsic compression, and among these, 75% corresponded to left main bronchus compression. Sixteen different types of clinically meaningful utilities were obtained. No mortality was reported and in only one procedure was there a major complication, which was easily managed. We concluded that FB is an important and safe diagnostic-therapeutic tool in the health care of neonates, infants, and children with a variety of cardiac diseases.",0,0
23909988,Current UK practice of pediatric supraglottic airway devices - a survey of members of the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland,"Objectives: Over half of general anesthetics in the UK involve supraglottic airway devices (SADs). The National Audit Project 4 undertaken by the Royal College of Anaesthetists demonstrated that aspiration was the most frequent complication relating to SAD use. SADs designed to reduce this risk (second-generation devices) are increasingly recommended in both adults and children. As well as routine use, SADs are recommended for use in cases of 'difficult airway'. This survey assessed current usage of SADs in routine practice and difficult airways. Sixteen questions, approved by the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (APAGBI) survey committee, were distributed to all its members. Results: Two hundred and forty-four members responded. Eighty-eight percent preferentially use first-generation rather than second-generation devices. The most important design feature was the availability of a complete range of sizes (84%). Seventy-seven percent felt that randomized controlled trials assessing SAD safety in children are needed. In cases of failed intubation, classically shaped SADs are preferred (79%). Three percent of responders intubate via an SAD routinely. Eighteen percent have employed this technique in an emergency. Thirty-six percent of responders have found an SAD to function poorly. Conclusion: Pediatric anesthesiologists appear slow to embrace second-generation SADs. The role of SADs in the management of difficult airways is widely accepted. Research currently has little influence over the choice of which SAD to use, which is more likely determined by personal choice and departmental preference. There is a risk that some SADs are unsafe.",0,0
19703743,Fracture of a GlideScope® Cobalt GVL® Stat disposable blade during an emergency intubation,"Background: Emergency airway management is a diverse discipline, often utilizing advanced equipment with video technology to enable the intubator to visualize a patient's vocal cords that would be difficult or impossible to see with routine direct laryngoscopy. The GlideScope® Cobalt (Saturn Biomedical Systems, Inc., Burnaby, BC, Canada) is one type of video laryngoscope with disposable plastic GVL® Stat blades (Saturn Biomedical Systems) that can improve glottic view over direct laryngoscopy. It also benefits from rapid turnaround time and few infection control issues due to its disposable blade. Objective: To report what we believe to be the first GlideScope® blade failure to be reported in the medical literature. The circumstances surrounding the blade failure may raise awareness of GVL® Stat usage in obese patients with limited mouth opening. Case report: During a standard emergency intubation, insertion of the GVL® Stat into the patient's mouth resulted in breakage of the distal segment of the blade. The patient was severely obese and had limited mouth opening, which required the blade to be inserted obliquely, rather than in the midline, into the patient's mouth. As the handle was repositioned back to midline, the distal segment of the blade broke off. No excessive force was used during blade repositioning when breakage occurred. Conclusion: Twisting forces on the distal flat segment of the GVL® Stat may have caused its failure. Because this was only a single occurrence of breakage, it is not clear if design issues or atypical insertion of the blade was responsible for breakage. Care must be exercised when midline insertion is not possible, which can occur in obese patients with limited mouth opening.",0,0
21401798,Evaluation of laryngoscopic views and related influencing factors in a pediatric population,"Background: Management of the difficult pediatric airway is a serious problem that anesthesiologists face in their practice. However, guidelines for adults may not be applied readily to pediatric populations. Aim: This study was performed to determine the incidence of different laryngoscopic views and the associated conditions. Methods: The authors collected data on 511 consecutive patients who were scheduled to receive general anesthesia. Laryngeal views were graded using the Cormack and Lehane classification, and grades III and IV were defined as difficult laryngoscopic visualization. The distances from the nose to the upper lip, lower lip to menthom, ear tragus to mouth, ear lobe to mouth, the horizontal length of mandible, and thyromental distance were measured. The association of these parameters with the laryngoscopic views was analyzed. Results: The incidence of grade I to IV laryngoscopic views was 80%, 17%, 3%, and 0%, respectively. All the cases that involved difficult laryngoscopy (3%) were aged ≤3 months. The distances from the lower lip to menthom and ear tragus to mouth had a direct association with difficult cases. There were no apparent cutoff points to predict difficult laryngoscopy, for any of the distances. Conclusion: The difficult cases were mostly aged <1 year. The association between difficult laryngoscopy and the distances between the lower lip border and menthom, ear tragus and corner of the mouth, and ear lobe and corner of the mouth can be summarized in an equation that may have potential use in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
8339159,Pediatric flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy--a preliminary report,"The introduction of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy into clinical use in 1968 had led a veritable explosion in the application of pulmonary endoscopy. In 1978, Wood and his colleagues, using a 3.5 mm Olympus 3C4 pediatric bronchoscope, expanded this technique to pediatric field. Up-to-now, they have more than 2000 bronchoscopies in pediatric patients, however, there has been no report in this field in Taiwan. I, using a new Olympus pediatric flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope 3C20, sedation and topic anesthesia, performed 24 airway examinations in 22 patients in the past 7-month period. The youngest patient was a 1672 gm, 4 day-old baby. The most frequent indication was stridor and most common diagnosis was laryngomalacia. The complications were not common and could have been avoidable if performed by an expert. My conclusion is that pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscopy is possible even in small babies less than 3 kg of weight.",0,0

This study explored factors associated with postoperative changes in airway dimensions. Patient airway volume was measured by acoustic reflectometory and neck muscle diameter by ultrasound echography in the pre- and post-anaesthetic periods in a total of 281 patients. Neck circumference was also assessed during these periods. A significant decrease in median (IQR [range]) total airway volume (from 63.8 (51.8-75.7 [14.7-103]) ml to 45.9 (33.5-57.2 [6.4-96.3]) ml, p < 0.0001), and a significant increase in muscle diameter (from 4.3 (3.3-5.6 [2.2-9.0]) mm to 5.8 (4.7-7.3 [2.8-1.3]) mm, p < 0.0001) and neck circumference (from 34.0 (32.5-37.0 [29.5-49.0]) cm to 35.0 (33.5-38.0 [30.5-50.5]) cm, p < 0.0001) were observed. It may be possible that changes in airway volume and neck circumference were influenced by surgical duration or peri-operative fluid management (ρ) = -0.31 (95% CI -0.24 to -0.01), p = 0.0301, -0.17 (-0.23 to -0.06), p = 0.0038, 0.23 (0.12-0.34), p < 0.0001, and 0.16 (0.05-0.27), p = 0.0062, respectively). The intra-oral space can significantly decrease and neck thickness increase after general anaesthesia, and might increase the risk of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation if airway management is required after extubation following general anaesthesia.",0,0
10365199,[Intratracheal intubation without muscle relaxant with the use of remifentanil-propofol],"Objectives: To assess tracheal intubation conditions after induction of anaesthesia with remifentanil and propofol, using itemized scoring criteria. Study design: Clinical, prospective, open, non comparative trial. Patients: One hundred consecutive patients undergoing surgery not requiring muscle relaxation, during the study period extended over 12 months. Methods: After premedication with lorazepam (2 mg) the day before and hydroxyzine (100 mg) one hour before surgery, anaesthesia was induced with remifentanil administered continuously with a syringe pump at a rate of 1.20 +/- 0.06 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and propofol (3 mg.kg-1 IV bolus). The trachea was intubated two minutes later and mouth opening, glottis exposure, glottis opening, movements, additional anaesthetic agents and chest rigidity were recorded. Results: Intubation conditions were excellent in 87% of patients, and the tube was inserted rapidly, within two minutes. However in 38% of patients the cuff inflation caused cough. In 13%, glottis opening was delayed and intubation required three minutes. A major decrease of arterial pressure and heart rate was recorded in 9 and 6% of patients respectively. Conclusion: Induction of anaesthesia using remifentanil and propofol allows satisfactory tracheal intubation without a muscle relaxant. However this technique is contraindicated: a) in patients with a full stomach, as intubation is not always successful at the first attempt; b) in patients scheduled to undergo neurosurgery or ophthalmic surgery, as tracheal intubation may elicit cough, increasing intra-cranial and intra-ocular pressure; c) in patients in poor circulatory status, as it decreases significantly arterial pressure and heart rate.",0,0
8317725,Reevaluation of a maneuver to visualize the anterior larynx after intubation,"Confirmation of translaryngeal placement of the tracheal tube can be unexpectedly difficult. This study examined the usefulness of displacing the larynx posteriorly with the tracheal tube during laryngoscopy with a straight laryngoscope blade to confirm tracheal tube placement. One hundred ASA Classes I, II, or III patients presenting for elective surgery whose normal anesthetic care included placement of an orotracheal tube via direct laryngoscopy were enrolled in this institutionally approved study after giving their written, informed consent. The view of the larynx at laryngoscopy was graded, and the tracheal tube was then inserted. When the larynx was incompletely exposed, the tracheal tube was displaced posteriorly while the laryngoscope was maintained in the intubating position in an attempt to better visualize the larynx. The effect of the maneuver on Mallampati grade for laryngeal exposure was noted. During laryngoscopy with a Miller blade none of the glottis was initially visualized in 17 patients (Mallampati laryngeal Grades 3 and 4). Thus, the tracheal tube actually was not seen to pass between these patients' vocal cords. Use of the maneuver resulted in improved visualization of the intubated larynx in 12 of these patients, and confirmed tracheal intubation. This maneuver is recommended as an aid to the anesthesiologist in the confirmation of tracheal intubation.",0,0
19999608,[Difficult airways--why do we need algorithms],"The difficult airway and/or intubation are still one of the most important challenges for anaesthesiologists. Recent clinical trials reported a decrease in the number of fatal cases associated with a difficult airway; however, these complications are still among the major causes of severe morbidity and mortality in anaesthesiology. Severe anaesthesiological complications including serious hypoxia, brain damage and death occur mostly during induction of anaesthesia, and are often related to a difficult airway. The term is often misinterpreted, and relates to failed intubation, difficult tracheal intubation, difficult laryngoscopy, and/or difficult mask ventilation. Difficult intubation is not easy to anticipate. The majority of prognostic methods, i.e. assessment scales accepted in clinical practice, are not satissfactory. Up to 40% of tracheal intubations preoperatively anticipated as difficult are performed without problems. In some cases, however, the procedure proves difficult only on direct laryngoscopy. This review presents current reports and statistical analysis of serious airway-related incidents in medical practice, and indicates the need for the introduction of mandatory guidelines for difficult airway assessment and management in clinical practice.",0,0

15271749,Prediction of difficult tracheal intubation in thyroid surgery,"The incidence of difficult endotracheal intubation (DEI) for patients undergoing thyroidectomy has rarely been studied, and evaluation of factors linked to DEI is limited to a few studies. We undertook this prospective study to investigate the incidence of DEI in the presence of goiter (an enlargement of the thyroid gland) and to evaluate factors linked to DEI. We studied 320 consecutive patients scheduled for thyroidectomy. DEI was evaluated by an intubation difficulty scale. The trachea was intubated by an unassisted anesthesiologist, and the intubation difficulty scale was calculated. A univariate analysis was performed to identify potential factors predicting DEI, followed by a multivariate analysis. DEI was reported in 17 patients. The rate of easy tracheal intubation was 36.9%; the rate for patients who had minor difficulty of intubation was 57.8%. Sex (male), body mass index, Mallampati class, thyromental distance, neck mobility, Cormack grade, cancerous goiter, and tracheal deviation or compression were identified in the univariate analysis as potential DEI risk factors. With multivariate analysis, two criteria were recognized as independent for DEI (Cormack Grade III or IV and cancerous goiter). We conclude that the large goiter is not associated with a more frequent DEI. However, the presence of a cancerous goiter is a major factor for predicting DEI.",1,1

Methods: Eighty-six patients with anticipated difficult tracheal intubation who were undergoing elective plastic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into CILA group(n=43) and FT-LMA group(n=43) . After general anesthesia being induced and CILA or FT-LMA being inserted, the patients were treated with blind intubation through CILA or FT-LMA. In each case, the number and the time of intubating laryngeal airway(ILA) insertion and blind intubation attempts and ILA removal were recorded. The view of glottis under fiberoptic bronchoscope(FOB) via CILA or FT-LMA was recorded. In addition, noninvasive blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before and after intravenous anesthetic induction, at ILA insertion, at intubation, at ILA removal and every minute thereafter for 5 minutes. Results: CILA or FT-LMA was inserted successfully in all 86 patients. The rate of the first successful insertion was not significantly different between two groups(P>0.05) . In CILA group, the first intubation attempt succeeded in 35 patients;5 and 2 cases were intubated blindly at the second and the third attempt, one patient failed who was intubated successfully by FOB via CILA. In FT-LMA group, 32 patients were intubated successfully at the first attempt, 4 at the second attempt, 3 at the third attempt, and 4 cases failed, three of them were intubated smoothly with FOB through FT-LMA, one failed patient was intubated by FOB. The time of FT-LMA insertion(34.2∓13.9) s was significantly longer when compared with CILA(22.4∓18.9) s (P<0.05) . However, the time of blind intubation through CILA and FT-LMA [(46.0∓26.7) s vs.(51.8∓41.1) s]and the time of ILA removal[(39.3∓11.9) s vs.(35.3∓10.4) s] were not significantly different between groups(P>0.05) . Hemodynamic changes during blind intubation in the two groups showed no significant differences(P>0.05) . Conclusions: Blind intubation via CILA or FT-LMA is safe and effective for anticipated difficult tracheal intubation. Nevertheless, CILA is easier to be inserted, with relatively higher success rate of blind intubation.",0,0

The patient presented to a peripheral hospital with swelling over the neck and face associated with bilateral pneumothorax for which bilateral intercostal drains were inserted and the patient was transferred to our institute. Fiber-optic videobronchoscopy (FOB) was performed, the trachea and bronchi were visualized, and the site and extent of injury was assessed. Spontaneous respiration was maintained till assessment of the airway. Then the patient was anesthetized with propofol and paralyzed using succinylcholine and a double-lumen endobronchial tube was inserted; thereafter, the adequacy of controlled manual ventilation and air-leak through intercostal drains was assessed and the patient was transferred to operating room (OR) for repair of the airway injury.

9069573,Comparison of laryngeal mask airway with endotracheal tube for airway control,"The study was designed to compare the effectiveness and ease of the insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and the endotracheal tube (ETT) according to the presence of signs of difficult airway. Eight hundred seventy nine patients undergoing elective surgery were randomly allocated in the ETT group (n = 453) and the LMA group (n = 426). Airway assessment was performed using the original Mallampati classification and measuring the maximum range of the head and neck mobility. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, propofol and succinylcholine. The severity of difficulty in ETT or LMA insertion was estimated on a three-point scale according to the final outcome of the airway management (0 = easy, 1 = difficult, 2 = impossible). Patients with suspected or observed difficulty in tracheal intubation proved to have easy insertion of LMA. Additionally, the ease of intubation was unrelated to potential failure of proper insertion of LMA. Although ""difficult"" patients in both studied groups have similar frequencies, the underlying anatomical characteristics were not similar.",0,0

Statistical analysis of deaths in the battlefield during combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan shows that 1% of the soldiers are killed because of airway obstruction. The aim of the study was to objectively evaluate the use of S.A.L.T. (Supraglottic Airway Laryngopharyngeal Tube), oropharyngeal airway (OPA) and nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) on the manikin with difficult airway to assess the risk of air introduction into the stomach during ventilation trauma patient and time of insertion of each device. Material and methods: A prospective study was conducted with the participation of 34 soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces (PAF). They ventilated a manikin using testing devices, to assess the volume of air entering the lungs and the stomach we used specially constructed flowmeters. The mean and median values of all measurements were calculated and compared by means of the Student's t test. Results: 102 device placements and 204 ventilations were performed and evaluated during the study. The median time required for placement of S.A.L.T. was 12.44 sec vs 13.32 sec for NPA vs 9,34 sec for OPA (p<0.05). Mean volumes of air entering the lungs and stomach during ventilation with S.A.L.T. were (ml) 194.23 and 166 respectively, for NPA 218.13 vs 200.93 and for OPA 197.47 vs 169.22. Conclusions: Total volume of air entering into the stomach using S.A.L.T. was the lowest among all three devices. The use of NPA did not show any clinically important advantage, the fastest insertion time for OPA may be of value in the battlefield.",0,0
27501601,The Performance of the Neck Circumference for a Difficult Laryngoscopy in Obese Patients,"Background and objective: There is conflicting evidence as to whether neck circumference (NC) is related to a difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients. The objectives of this study were to determine the performance of the NC in defining a difficult laryngoscopy, and to identify factors predicting a difficult laryngoscopy among those obese patients. Material and method: This prospective study was conducted in adult patients with a body mass index (BM) of greater or equal to 30 kg/m² who underwent conventional endotracheal intubation. Preoperative NC, the modified Mallampati test (MMT), the thyromental distance (TM) and the sternomental distance (SM) were measured. A difficult laryngoscopy was defined as a Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopic view of grade III or IV. Results: Five hundred patients (366 females; 134 males), with a mean BMI of 34.3 ± 4.6 kg/m² (minimum = 30.0 kg/m², and maximum = 68.4 kg/m²) and who had elective surgery planned, were enrolled. The incidence of a difficult laryngoscopy was 7.2%. The overall performance of the NC using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of a difficult laryngoscopy was 0.574, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.53 to 0.618. The optimal cutoff point of the NC for a difficult laryngoscopy was 37.1 centimeters. It provided sensitivity and specificity of 75.5% (95% CI 57.8, 87.9) and 42.5% (95% CI 37.9, 47.2). The positive and negative predictive values were 9.2% and 95.6%. After multivariate analysis, factors affecting a difficult laryngoscopy were high grades of MMT (odds ratio (OR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.10, 4.50) and NC/TM (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.15, 2.74). Conclusion: The NC per se was not a good predictor of a difficult laryngoscopy. However the ratio of the NC to the TM and the MMT were factors predicting a difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients.",0,0
8949801,Sternomental distance as the sole predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in obstetric anaesthesia,"Sternomental distance and view at laryngoscopy were documented in 523 parturients undergoing elective or emergency Caesarean section under general anaesthesia. Eighteen (3.5%) had a grade III or IV laryngoscopic view (Cormack and Lehane's classification) and were classified as potentially difficult tracheal intubations. There was a significant difference between sternomental distance in those patients with a grade III or IV laryngoscopic view compared with those with a grade I or II (13.17 (SD 1.54) cm vs 14.3 (1.49) cm; P = 0.0013). A sternomental distance of 13.5 cm or less with the head fully extended on the neck and the mouth closed provided, using discriminant analysis, the best cut-off point for predicting subsequent difficult laryngoscopy. A sternomental distance of 13.5 cm or less had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 66.7%, 71.1%, 7.6% and 98.4%, respectively. While there was no association between sternomental distance and age, weight, height or body mass index (BMI), there was a significant association between grade of laryngoscopy (III and IV) and older (P = 0.049) and heavier (P = 0.0495) mothers. The results suggest that while sternomental distance on its own may not be an adequate sole predictor of subsequent difficult laryngoscopy the measurement should be incorporated into a series of quick and simple preoperative tests.",0,0

23159431,Pocket mobile smartphone system for the point-of-care submandibular ultrasonography,"Background: Focused ultrasonography of the airway may be useful in the prediction of difficult intubation. The wider use of sonography in quantitative airway assessment may depend on the availability of highly portable, inexpensive, and accurate ultrasound systems. Pocket-sized ultrasound devices are emerging as a useful tool for point-of-care ultrasonography. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suprahyoid airway of healthy volunteers using a smartphone-based ultrasound imaging system in comparison with a platform-based machine. Methods: Mobisante MobiUS SP1 system with 2 mechanical sector (3.5 and 7.5 MHz) probes was used to acquire images of the tongue and measure the diameter of the hyomental muscle in the mouth floor. In the same group of subjects, imaging and measurements were repeated using BK Medical Flex Focus 400 ultrasound system with linear (18 MHz ) and curved 5 (MHz) transducers. The MobiUS system was also used to image plastic cylinders and procedure needles embedded in tofu bars. Outside diameters of cylinders were measured using digital calipers and sonography. Results: The mean diameter of the hyomental muscle in 10 healthy volunteers was 7.22 ± 1.6 mm using BK 18 MHz probe, 7.11 ± 1.7 mm using MobiUS 7.5 MHz probe, and 7.84 ± 2 mm using MobiUS 3.5 MHz probe. These means were not statistically different (BK vs Mo 7.5, P = .74, and BK vs Mo 3.5, P = .13). The mean outside diameter of plastic cylinders measured with digital calipers was 10.1 ± 0.2 mm (n = 5) vs 9.8 ± 0.3 mm and 10.2 ± 0.2 mm using 3.5 and 7.5 MHz probes, respectively. These means were not statistically different (calipers vs Mo 3.5, P = .16 and calipers vs Mo 7.5, P = .39). Conclusion: Mobisante MobiUS system was able to acquire clinically useful images of the suprahyoid airway and muscular architecture in the mouth floor and allowed accurate measurements of linear distances.",0,0

To directly test the effects of RSV LRI, we infected adult and weanling BALB/c mice with RSV (A2) or vehicle. Respiratory system impedance was used to assess baseline airway function and responses to iv methacholine (MCh) at 4, 8, 24 and 34 weeks post infection. In vitro airway responses were measured 24 weeks post infection using electrical field stimulation and MCh. Mice infected as adults showed no alterations in airway function. Mice infected as weanlings had increased MCh responses 24 weeks post infection. However, the increased response was not present 34 weeks post infection nor accompanied by alterations in in vitro responses or airway morphometry. This study did not detect long-lasting changes in airway function following RSV infection in mice. These data do not provide support for alterations in airway structure or function being responsible for the observed relationship between RSV infection in infants and asthma in later life.",0,0
11259887,"Comparison of no airway device, the Guedel-type airway and the Cuffed Oropharyngeal Airway with mask ventilation during manual in-line stabilization","Study objective: To compare two different types of oropharyngeal airway: the Guedel-type oral airway and the Cuffed Oropharyngeal Airway (COPA), with respect to the effectiveness of positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) through a face mask in patients with in-line stabilization of the head and neck. Design: Prospective, randomized, crossover study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: 30 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing elective surgery. Interventions: General anesthesia was induced with propofol and muscle relaxation was produced with vecuronium. In a random sequence, no airway device, the Guedel-type airway, and the COPA were used in each patient while applying a face mask and lifting the jaw forward. Measurements and main results: Tidal volumes were measured during PPV in each option. The position of the distal tip of each airway was assessed using a fiberscope, and the resulting views were graded and compared. When the Guedel-type airway was used, tidal volumes (V(T)s; means +/- SD) were significantly greater (12.3 +/- 4.5 mL/kg) than those with no airway device (8.5 +/- 4.5 mL/kg) (p < 0.001). When the COPA was used, V(T)s (14.6 +/- 4.4 mL/kg) were significantly greater than those with the Guedel-type airway (p < 0.05). The grade of the fiberscopic view through the distal tip was significantly better with the COPA than with the Guedel-type airway (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Although clinical differences often appear trivial, the COPA is more effective on mask ventilation than the Guedel-type airway when used in patients with manual in-line stabilization.",0,0
22569026,Airway difficulty in Mallampati 'class zero' patients: a prospective double-blind observational study,"Context: Assessment of Mallampati class is an integral part of preoperative airway evaluation. Increasing Mallampati class is known to be associated with greater difficulty with intubation, but some cases of airway difficulty in Mallampati 'class zero' patients have been reported. Objective(s): We undertook this study to evaluate intubation difficulty and to correlate this with indirect laryngoscopy findings in Mallampati class zero patients. The incidence of Mallampati class zero airway in Indian patients and the difficulty in mask ventilation were also evaluated. Design: Prospective double-blind observational study. Setting: A tertiary care medical college hospital in Karnataka, India. Study period: September 2010 to April 2011. Patients: Patients of either sex, 18 years and older, presenting for preanaesthetic examination for elective surgery were evaluated. All patients with Mallampati class zero airway undergoing general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation were included. Exclusion criteria were upper airway disorder, unstable cervical spine, increased risk for aspiration, ischaemic heart disease, increased intracranial pressure, respiratory distress, those unable to sit upright, or infected with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV or pulmonary tuberculosis, or requiring emergency surgery. All underwent indirect laryngoscopy performed by the otorhinolaryngologist and subsequently, direct laryngoscopy performed by the anaesthesiologist. Intubation difficulty was assessed by the Cormack & Lehane grades. Main outcome measures: Evaluation of intubation difficulty and correlation with indirect laryngoscopy findings in Mallampati class zero patients. Estimation of the incidence of Mallampati class zero airway in Indian patients and the difficulty in mask ventilation. Results: Twenty women and thirteen men, aged 18-65 years, of Mallampati class zero were identified out of 1937 (incidence, 1.7%). The data of 27 patients were analysed. Two patients had 'difficult' mask ventilation. All had a 'predicted easy' airway on indirect laryngoscopy and 'easy' (Cormack & Lehane grade 1 or 2) tracheal intubation. Upon direct laryngoscopy, the epiglottis was described as 'large' in 10 (37%) patients. Conclusion: A Mallampati class zero per se is not associated with difficult airway unless other airway characteristics contribute to the difficulty. Even though the epiglottis may be large and overhanging, it rarely causes airway difficulty in Mallampati class zero airway.",0,0

Methods: This case report presents the dental management of an anxious female with Moebius syndrome. For restorations, atraumatic restorative technique (ART), using glass ionomer cement was used with hand instruments. Results: All necessary dental treatment was completed in the dental chair, thus avoiding the need for a general anaesthetic, and associated complications with airway management due to orofacial abnormalities. Conclusions: ART is an appropriate technique for people with microstomia and/or limited mouth opening, such as those with Moebius syndrome.

19194154,"High body mass index is a weak predictor for difficult and failed tracheal intubation: a cohort study of 91,332 consecutive patients scheduled for direct laryngoscopy registered in the Danish Anesthesia Database","Background: Previous studies have failed to detect high body mass index (BMI) as a risk factor for difficult tracheal intubation (DTI). BMI was investigated as a risk factor for DTI in patients planned for direct laryngoscopy. Methods: A cohort of 91,332 consecutive patients planned for intubation by direct laryngoscopy was retrieved from the Danish Anesthesia Database. A four-point scale to grade the tracheal intubation was used. Age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, priority of surgery, history of previous DTI, modified Mallampati-score, use of neuromuscular blocker, and BMI were retrieved. Logistic regression to assess whether BMI was associated with DTI was performed. Results: The frequency of DTI was 5.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0-5.3). In multivariate analyses adjusted for other significant covariates, BMI of 35 or more was a risk for DTI with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% CI 1.19-1.51, P < 0.0001). As a stand alone test, BMI of 35 or more predicted DTI with a sensitivity of 7.5% (95% CI 7.3-7.7%) and with a predictive value of a positive test of 6.4% (95% CI 6.3-6.6%). BMI as a continuous covariate was a risk for failed intubation with an odds ratio of 1.031 (95% CI 1.002-1.061, P < 0.04). Conclusions: High BMI is a weak but statistically significant predictor of difficult and failed intubation and may be more appropriate than weight in multivariate models of prediction of DTI.",1,1
21347739,Retromolar fibreoptic orotracheal intubation in a patient with severe trismus undergoing nasal surgery,"Purpose: A considerable challenge arises when passage of an endotracheal tube between the teeth is impossible because of severe trismus and the presence of concomitant contraindications to nasotracheal intubation. We report a novel technique to circumvent the need for tracheostomy by using the retromolar space for oral fibreoptic intubation. Clinical features: A 50-yr-old female with a history of pharyngeal cancers treated with surgery and radiotherapy presented for right dacryocystorhinostomy. She had undergone left dacryocystorhinostomy after nasotracheal intubation one week earlier. This time, orotracheal intubation was requested since surgery would involve the right nostril and left nasal intubation might dislodge the recently placed nasolacrimal tube. Due to severe trismus, the patient's interincisor distance was only 9 mm, and it was impossible to pass a 6.0 mm endotracheal tube through that gap. A flexible bronchoscope loaded with a 6.0 mm tracheal tube was inserted through the retromolar space into the pharynx and maneuvered through the vocal cords for endotracheal intubation. Conclusions: The retromolar space is located between the last molar and the ascending ramus of the mandible. Even with complete mandibular occlusion, it is usually able to accommodate a 7.0 mm endotracheal tube. Despite its hidden location, it can be used successfully for orotracheal fibreoptic intubation. With practice, the expertise achieved in performing this technique will confer a much needed option for securing the airway in this challenging situation.",0,0

22303512,"Nasal Endotracheal Intubation under Fibreoptic Endoscopic Control in Difficult Oral Intubation, Two Pediatric Cases of Submandibular Abscess","Securing an airway in children with trismus is challenging and dangerous. Sound clinical judgment is critical for timing and for selecting the method for airway intervention. We present two pediatric cases of submandibular abscess with difficult oral intubation who underwent incision and drainage. Large facial (jaw) swelling, trismus-limited mouth opening, edema, protruding teeth, and altered airway anatomy makes airway management more difficult. Chances of rupture of abscess intraorally and aspiration under General Anesthesia (GA) is a major threat. Loss of airway under muscle relaxation, difficult to ventilate, difficult to intubate and unwillingness for awake intubation in the pediatric age group makes these cases most challenging. On the basis of our experience, both cases were successfully intubated in anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing children with visual-guided fibreoptic intubation.",0,0

The utility of the novel, portable, battery-powered C-MAC video laryngoscope is as yet unproven. It was hypothesized that in routine patients undergoing ENT surgery, the rate of glottic views considered unsatisfactory, i.e. Cormack and Lehane grades IIb, III, and IV, could be significantly reduced with the C-MAC video laryngoscope compared to direct laryngoscopy. Methods: Following ethical approval and sample size estimates 108 consecutive patients undergoing ENT surgery under general anesthesia were studied. First, direct laryngoscopy was performed with the naked eye. The best view obtained was graded by the first anesthesiologist without looking at the video monitor. A second anesthesiologist blinded to the laryngeal view obtained under direct laryngoscopy graded the laryngeal view on the video monitor. Endotracheal intubation using Ring-Adair-Elwyn (RAE) tracheal tubes was then attempted under video-aided visualization. The tubes were not reinforced with a stylet. The C-MAC video laryngoscopy system (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) is a novel device that can be used with Macintosh laryngoscope blades in different sizes. A camera and light source are located recessed from the tip of the blade. The camera unit sits in a handle attached to the laryngoscope blade and is connected by a wire to a TFT video monitor. It allows for both direct and indirect laryngoscopy and the low profile of the original British Macintosh blades may prove advantageous in patients with limited mouth opening. Results: A total of 108 patients were enrolled in the study but for various reasons only 94 completed the study (post hoc power 97%). In 89 patients a size 3 Macintosh laryngoscope was used while a size 4 blade was used in the remaining 5 patients. With direct laryngoscopy the glottic view was considered unsatisfactory in 40 patients (42%), but this was the case in only 15 patients (16%) when video laryngoscopy was used (p<0.0001). Endotracheal tube placement was successful in all but one patient where the Bonfils intubation fiberscope needed to be employed. No complications related to the C-MAC system were observed. Conclusions: Compared to direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh laryngoscope blade in unselected patients undergoing ENT surgery and thus patients more susceptible to an unexpected difficult airway than a general patient population, the mobile C-MAC video laryngoscope significantly enhanced laryngeal view. Using RAE tracheal tubes seems to compensate the unfavorable deviation of optical and anatomical axes when indirect laryngoscopy is performed with the C-MAC system.",0,1
8984868,Simulated difficult intubation. Comparison of the gum elastic bougie and the stylet,"A randomised study was carried out to compare the efficacy of the gum elastic bougie and the stylet in a simulated difficult intubation. A laryngoscopic assessment, as described by Cormack and Lehane, was made in 100 patients. A Grade 3 view was then simulated. In the Bougie First Group (50 patients) two attempts were made to pass a gum elastic bougie and a tracheal tube into the trachea. If these first two attempts were not successful, two further attempts at intubation were allowed with a stylet placed in the tracheal tube. In the Stylet First Group (50 patients) the order was reversed. After two attempts the tube was correctly placed in the trachea in 96% of cases in the Bougie First Group compared to only 66% of cases in the Stylet First Group (p < 0.001). We recommend that a gum elastic bougie should be readily available and that anaesthetists should use it in preference to a stylet whenever a good view of the glottis is not immediately available.",0,0
8636524,Topical upper airway anaesthesia with lidocaine increases airway resistance by impairing glottic function,"Objective: To assess if two different forms of upper airway topical anaesthesia induce similar changes in airway flow resistance (Rrs). Design: Serial measurements of Rrs before and after topical anaesthesia with acqueous or paste lidocaine. Setting: Lung function test laboratory. Participants: 9 normal men with documented normal lung function tests. Interventions: 2 different session of topical upper airway anaesthesia with 100 mg of liquid 5% lidocaine and 100 mg of 2% lidocaine paste, respectively. Measurements and results: Rrs was measured by the random noise forced oscillation technique. Fiberoptic upper airway examination was performed in two subjects. Rrs increased on average by 81% after lidocaine spray and by 68% after lidocaine paste (p < 0.005, respectively) with no difference in the magnitude of Rrs increase between the two modes of anaesthesia studied. This increase lasted 13 +/- 3 min (spray) and 12 +/- 3 min (paste), respectively (p = ns). Fiberoptic examination of the two most responders showed inspiratory laryngeal collapse. Conclusions: Topical upper airway anaesthesia transiently increases Rrs with no specific effects regarding the drug presentation. Laryngeal dysfunction may be one mechanisms involved in Rrs increase following upper airway topical anaesthesia. Such findings may explain some poor respiratory tolerance reported during endoscopy.",0,0
11200758,[Complications of difficult tracheal intubations in a critical care unit],"Objectives: This study was performed in order to evaluate the frequency of DI, the predictive factors of DI and to list the related complications. Study design: Prospective non randomized, open study. Patients and methods: All patients intubated in the critical care unit during the five months of the study were included. The previous history and clinical setting of the patients, the conditions and the complications of intubation were collected. DI was defined when the procedure required more than two laryngoscopies. Results: The study included 80 patients. The rate of DI was 22.5%. The Mallampati score (p < 0.001) was the only predictive factor. The frequency of complications was 25%. This rate was 55% for DI versus 16% for easy intubations (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study confirms the high incidence of DI and associated complications in critical care. We suggest the development of airway management protocols in critical care unit in order to reduce the rate of DI.",0,0
10771705,Tracheobronchial amyloidosis. The Boston University experience from 1984 to 1999,"Tracheobronchial amyloidosis (TBA), an idiopathic disorder characterized by deposition of fibrillar proteins in the tracheobronchial tree, occurred in 10 patients referred to the Amyloid Program at Boston University over the past 15 years. Fewer than 100 cases of TBA have been described; only 1 series encompassed more than 3 patients. We analyzed our experience with biopsy-proven TBA to define better its natural history. Follow-up averaged approximately 8 years and was obtained in all cases, making this outcome reporting the largest and most complete to date. Three of these patients were prospectively studied for up to 24 months to examine the utility of bronchoscopy, computerized tomography (CT) imaging, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in monitoring disease progression. No patient with TBA developed signs or symptoms of systemic amyloidosis during the period reviewed. Conversely, tracheobronchial disease was not diagnosed in 685 patients with primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis during the 15-year study period at Boston University. Bronchoscopy proved most useful in establishing the diagnosis by biopsy. Narrowing of major airways limited its inspection of the tracheobronchial tree, however. In contrast, CT imaging provided quantitative assessment of airway narrowing and mural thickening--2 major consequences of amyloid infiltration. These CT features, in the presence of mural calcifications sparing the posterior tracheal membrane, have been reported in few disorders other than TBA. The ability of CT to map airway involvement and identify extraluminal manifestations of TBA made it the study of choice for establishing disease extent. Three patterns of disease were evident by CT imaging and bronchoscopic examination: proximal, mid, and distal airways involvement. Those with severe proximal disease had significantly decreased air flows, air trapping, and fixed upper airway obstruction on PFTs. Patients with distal disease had normal airflows. PFTs could not clearly distinguish proximal from severe mid airways disease. Thirty percent of patients died within 7-12 years after diagnosis, all having proximal or severe mid airways disease. Repeated rigid bronchoscopic debridement and laser treatments did not prevent progressive airways narrowing in patients dying from TBA. Most patients with mid airways involvement, and all distal airway cases, had either stagnant disease or slowly increasing amyloid deposits when followed for up to 14 years. In a small subset of patients followed prospectively, serial PFTs were most sensitive to disease progression. CT-derived measures of airway lumen diameter and wall thickness did not change significantly despite marked improvements in airflow after rigid bronchoscopy. Our experience suggests that serial PFTs and CT imaging together offer the best assessment of airway involvement and disease progression in patients with TBA. In the future, radiation therapy may provide more definitive treatment of TBA than debulking procedure have to date.",0,0
24163453,Diagnostic value of the upper lip bite test in predicting difficulty in intubation with head and neck landmarks obtained from lateral neck X-ray,"Background: Unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation remains a primary concern of anaesthesiologists and upper lip bite test (ULBT) is one of the assessments used in predicting difficult intubation. In this study, we aimed to check the utility of lateral neck X-ray measurements in improving the diagnostic value of the ULBT. Methods: In a prospective study conducted from January 2007 until December 2010, we recorded personal and demographic data of 4500 patients who entered the study and subjected them to standard lateral neck radiography. Before the induction of anaesthesia, clinical examination and ULBT results were recorded and during induction of anaesthesia laryngoscopic grading was evaluated and recorded in questionnaires. All the compiled data were analysed by SPSS 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. Diagnostic value for each test was calculated and compared. Results: Negative predictive values (NPVs) were high in all tests. ULBT had the highest specificity and NPV compared with the other tests. The positive predictive value for all the tests had been low, but marginally high in the ULBT. Conclusion: Although all the tests used had relatively acceptable predictive values, combination of tests appeared to be more predictive. Highest sensitivities were observed with ULBT, mandibulohyoid distance and thyromental distance respectively. Use of radiological parameters may not be suitable as screening tools, but may help in anticipating and preparing for a difficult scenario.",1,1
1610011,Relative risk analysis of factors associated with difficult intubation in obstetric anesthesia,"Difficult tracheal intubation, often unexpected, has been identified as the commonest contributory factor to anesthetic-related maternal death. The ability to predict such cases preoperatively would be of great value. Preoperative airway assessment and potential risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation were recorded in 1,500 patients undergoing emergency and elective cesarean section under general anesthesia. Airway assessment using a modified Mallampati test recorded oropharyngeal structures visible upon maximal mouth opening. Potential risk factors documented were obesity; short neck; missing, protruding, or single maxillary incisors; receding mandible; facial edema; and swollen tongue. Subsequent to induction of anesthesia, the view at laryngoscopy and difficulty at intubation were graded. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) correlation between the oropharyngeal structures seen and both the veiw at laryngoscopy and difficulty at intubation. Univariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between difficult intubation and short neck (P less than 0.001), obesity (P less than 0.0001), missing maxillary incisors (P less than 0.02), protruding maxillary incisors (P less than 0.001), single maxillary incisor (P less than 0.0001), and receding mandible (P less than 0.003). Neither facial edema (P = 0.414) nor swollen tongue (P = 0.141) were found to be associated with difficult intubation. Multivariate analysis removed obesity and missing and single maxillary incisors as risk factors. Obesity was eliminated because of its strong association with short neck. The probability of experiencing a difficult intubation for various combinations of risk factors was determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,1
18593650,Comparison of the upper lip bite test with measurement of thyromental distance for prediction of difficult intubations,"Background: The upper lip bite test (ULBT) introduced in 2003 is a simple method for predicting difficult intubations. According to this test, the higher a patient can bite the upper lip with the lower incisors, the lower the risk of difficult intubation. Given the necessity for evaluation and re-evaluation of a newer predictive method, this study was conducted to compare the ULBT with another method for difficult airway prediction, the measurement of thyromental distance (TMD). Methods: In this prospective, observational, single-blind study, 350 patients who required inhaled general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for elective surgery were enrolled for evaluation of the accuracy in predicting difficult intubation by TMD measurement and ULBT. In the ULBT, the capacity of biting the upper lip is categorized into three classes: class I, a patient is able to raise the lower incisors above the vermilion line; class II, a patient is able to bite the upper lip below the vermilion line; and class III, a patient is unable to bite the upper lip. After induction of anesthesia with a standard protocol, the patient's grade of laryngeal view by the Cormack-Lehane classification was documented by an anesthesiologist with at least 3 years' experience who was unaware of prior evaluations. A TMD equal to or less than 4 cm and a class III ULBT were considered to be predictive of difficult intubation. A Cormack-Lehane class III or IV was considered a difficult intubation. Results: Only 20 (5.7%) of the patients were considered to have difficult intubations. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were 70%, 93.3%, 39%, 98.1%, and 92.6%, respectively, for the ULBT, and 55%, 88%, 22%, 97%, and 86.3%, respectively, for TMD. Specificity and positive predictive value were found to be significantly higher for the ULBT than for TMD (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy were not significantly different between the two methods. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the sensitivity of the ULBT and TMD for predicting difficult intubations may not be significantly different, but the specificity of the ULBT is significantly higher. The positive predictive value of the ULBT was significantly higher than that of TMD, signifying that a positive ULBT is more predictive of a difficult airway than is a positive TMD.",1,1
16674624,A comparison of the Seeing Optical Stylet and the gum elastic bougie in simulated difficult tracheal intubation: a manikin study,"Management of the difficult airway is one of the major challenges that anaesthetists face. The flexible fibreoptic scope is widely available but its use requires a level of skill, training and continued practice that is not universally found in all anaesthetists, particularly trainees. The Seeing Optical Stylet is a new, semirigid fibreoptic stylet 'scope. We compared the Seeing Optical Stylet with a gum elastic bougie in a simulated Cormack and Lehane Grade 3 laryngoscopy in a manikin. Forty-four anaesthetists were timed while intubating the manikin's trachea with both devices. The mean (SD) time taken with the Seeing Optical Stylet was 20.8 (9.3) s and with the bougie 30 (19.8) s (p = 0.001). Oesophageal intubation occurred six times with the bougie but did not occur with the Seeing Optical Stylet (p = 0.011). We conclude that the Seeing Optical Stylet may be superior to the bougie in difficult tracheal intubation. We feel that the results of this manikin trial are sufficiently encouraging to proceed to a clinical trial in patients.",0,0
12548031,"Extubation failure: magnitude of the problem, impact on outcomes, and prevention","Extubation failure, defined as the need for reinstitution of ventilatory support within 24 to 72 hours of planned endotracheal tube removal, occurs in 2 to 25% of extubated patients. The pathophysiologic causes of extubation failure include an imbalance between respiratory muscle capacity and work of breathing, upper airway obstruction, excess respiratory secretions, inadequate cough, encephalopathy, and cardiac dysfunction. Compared with patients who tolerate extubation, those who require reintubation have a higher incidence of hospital mortality, increased length of ICU and hospital stay, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, higher hospital costs, and an increased need for tracheostomy. Given the lack of proven treatments for extubation failure, clinicians must be aware of the factors that predict extubation outcome to improve clinical decision making. Risk factors for extubation failure include being a medical, multidisciplinary, or pediatric patient; age greater than 70 years; a longer duration of mechanical ventilation; continuous intravenous sedation; and anemia. Tests designed to assess for upper airway obstruction, secretion volume, and the effectiveness of cough can help to improve prediction of extubation failure. Rapid reinstitution of ventilatory support in patients who fail extubation may improve outcome.",0,0
27212757,The efficacy of combined regional nerve blocks in awake orotracheal fiberoptic intubation,"Aims of study: To evaluate the efficacy, hemodynamic changes, and patient comfort during awake fiberoptic intubation done under combined regional blocks. Materials and methods: In the present observational study, 50 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA) Grade I-II, Mallampati Grade I-IV were given nerve blocks - bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve block, bilateral superior laryngeal nerve block, and recurrent laryngeal nerve block before awake fiberoptic intubation using 2% lidocaine. Results: Procedure was associated with minimal increases in hemodynamic parameters during the procedure and until 3 min after it. Most of the intubations were being carried out within 3 min. Patient comfort was satisfactory with 90% of patients having favorable grades. Discussion: The most common cause of mortality and serious morbidity due to anesthesia is from airway problems. One-third of all anesthetic deaths are due to failure to intubate and ventilate. Awake flexible fiberoptic intubation under local anesthesia is now an accepted technique for managing such situations. In awake patient's anatomy, muscle tone, airway protection, and ventilation are preserved, but it is essential to sufficiently anesthetize the upper airway before the performance of awake fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided intubation to ensure patient comfort and cooperation for which in our study we used the nerve block technique. Conclusion: A properly performed technique of awake fiberoptic intubation done under combined regional nerve blocks provides good intubating conditions, patient comfort and safety and results in minimal hemodynamic changes.",0,0
26957691,Diagnostic accuracy of bedside tests for predicting difficult intubation in Indian population: An observational study,"Background: Unanticipated difficult intubation can be challenging to anesthesiologists, and various bedside tests have been tried to predict difficult intubation. Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of difficult intubation in the Indian population and also to determine the diagnostic accuracy of bedside tests in predicting difficult intubation. Settings and design: In this study, 200 patients belonging to age group 18-60 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II, scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were enrolled. Patients with upper airway pathology, neck mass, and cervical spine injury were excluded from the study. Materials and methods: An attending anesthesiologist conducted preoperative assessment and recorded parameters such as body mass index, modified Mallampati grading, inter-incisor distance, neck circumference, and thyromental distance (NC/TMD). After standard anesthetic induction, laryngoscopy was performed, and intubation difficulty assessed using intubation difficulty scale on the basis of seven variables. Statistical analysis: The Chi-square test or student t-test was performed when appropriate. The binary multivariate logistic regression (forward-Wald) model was used to determine the independent risk factors. Results: Among the 200 patients, 26 patients had difficult intubation with an incidence of 13%. Among different variables, the Mallampati score and NC/TMD were independently associated with difficult intubation. Receiver operating characteristic curve showed a cut-off point of 3 or 4 for Mallampati score and 5.62 for NC/TMD to predict difficult intubation. Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of NC/TM ratio and Mallampatti score were better compared to other bedside tests to predict difficult intubation in Indian population.",0,0
8992905,[Movement of the temporomandibular joint during tracheal intubation],"Laryngoscopy causes temporary postoperative dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ): during iatrogenic TMJ manipulation in anaesthetised patients, the TMJs have lost the protection afforded by the tone of the surrounding muscles. Thus far, the exact type and extent of TMJ movements have not been known. The purpose of this study was to develop a method to visualise and assess TMJ movements during intubation by means of electronic axiography, a diagnostic monitor of TMJ movements used in dentistry: registration of the hinge axis (HA) as an equivalent of the condylar paths on extra-oral sagittaly mounted, parallel plates. The HA is individually defined in each patient by the pure, rotating TMJ movement during initial mouth opening (no farward gliding of the condyles, incisor distance up to 10 mm). The parallel plates are placed in the TMJ region in the skull-mounted plate bow: both registration tips (""drawing"" the HA tracings on the electronic plates) are connected to the mandible by a face bow, paraocclusally fixed to the teeth. The face bow is individually shaped for each patient to allow mask ventilation and free movement of the laryngoscope during intubation. HA tracings are registered and calculated for both sides independently every 24 ms with the SAM/Klett system and presented on sagittal and frontal projections. In the operating theatre, the active mouth-opening traces (MOT) are registered first and the passive endotracheal intubation traces (EIT) after induction of anaesthesia (same head position). With informed consent and approval by the ethics committee of the Landesärztekammer Rheinland Pfalz. 40 male patients (ASA I. Mallampati I, limb surgery) were randomly allocated to four groups (n = 10 each). OS: Oral intubation, suxamethonium (1.5 mg/ kg); OV: Oral intubation, vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg); NS: Nasal intubation, suxamethonium (1.5 mg/kg); and NV: Nasal intubation, vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg). Intubation was performed 100 s after injection of the relaxant. Pre- and postoperatively (every 24 h over 3 days, in case of positive findings longer) recorded were: active movements of the mandible (maximal mouth opening/ max. laterotrusion); dysfunction of the TMJ; and pain sensation in the TMJ (Helkimo rating). MOTs and EITs were recorded and analysed with the system described and typical EIT patterns were identified: bland, clinically uneventful intubations (n = 7), massive distraction and laterotrusion of the EIT compared to the MOT (n = 24), and blocked or limited TMJ movements resulting in intubation problems (n = 1). With the method presented, TMJ movements could be visualised during endotracheal intubation for the first time. It can be used to assess techniques, routes, and instruments for intubation as well as to evaluate potential traumatising movements during endotracheal intubation.",0,0

3985306,[The modified Kleinsasser tube: the ideal in difficult intubation],"The modified Kleinsasser tube is commonly used for laryngeal tumour diagnosis. The tube has a semilunar cross-section with a radius of 2.5 cm and a diameter of 3 cm. Its lower third contains a cold light lamp placed so that it cannot become covered by blood or tumour masses. After insertion of the endotracheal tube into the patient the Kleinsasser tube is placed at the entrance of the larynx. Operations are done through the inner lumen of the Kleinsasser tube. The Kleinsasser tube has proved a reliable instrument for insertion of endotracheal tubes in patients whose vocal cords could not be seen by ordinary laryngoscopy, e.g. patients with a short neck and unable to recline, with severe hypopharyngeal haemorrhage, with obstruction at the base of the tongue and partial occlusion of the laryngeal entrance by tumour. After introduction the vocal cords may be inspected in their entire length and under bright light the endotracheal tube may be brought safely through the Kleinsasser tube into endotracheal position using Magill forceps as an auxiliary instrument.",0,0
23077876,[Study on the association of imaging and clinical anatomic data in the prediction of difficult intubation],"Difficult intubation is a serious challenge for emergency doctors and anesthesiologists. Aim: This study was aimed at investigating the effectiveness of imaging methods combined with clinical anatomic data in predicting difficult intubation by developing a score as thorough and easy to use as possible. Material and methods: This prospective study was carried out on a series of 121 patients (51 males and 70 females), aged between 18 and 85 years (mean age 45.5 years) in the interval September 2010 0 June 2011. The patients, scheduled for various surgical interventions requiring general anesthesia by oral tracheal intubation, were randomly selected and gave a written consent. Children and pregnant women were excluded. The criteria for clinical anatomic assessment and cerebral and cervical imaging methods were used in all patients. By corroborating these data, a difficult intubation prediction score, named OMLET, was developed. It included 5 parameters: obesity (IMC), Mallampati score (modified), position of the larynx as to the spine, cervicothoracic angle (CTA), and head extension (DTM). Each variable was attributed 0 or 2 points, the highest score being 10 points, the obtained score being directly proportional with the expected difficulty during oral tracheal intubation. Results: Of the 121 patients, 9 were difficult cases, the incidence of difficult intubation being 7.43%. The Cormack-Lehane score predicted a difficult intubation in 11 of the 121 cases (sensitivity 77.78%, specificity 96.43%), while the OMLET score predicted 6 of the 9 difficult intubations (sensitivity of 66.67%, specificity of 95.43%. positive predictive value 54.55%, and negative predictive value 97.27%). Conclusions: The OMLET score proved effective in predicting difficult intubation expressed in its high specificity and sensitivity, and could be used especially in patients with conditions of the cephalic extremity and neck inevitably requiring before surgery investigation of these areas.",0,0
11465622,Comparison of the intubating laryngeal mask airway with the fiberoptic intubation in anticipated difficult airway management,"Background: The intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA; Fastrach; Laryngeal Mask Company, Henley-on-Thames, UK) may provide an alternative technique to fiberoptic intubation (FIB) to facilitate the management of the anticipated difficult airway. The authors therefore compared the effectiveness of the ILMA with FIB in patients with anticipated difficult intubation. Methods: One hundred patients, with at least one difficult intubation criteria (Mallampati class III or IV, thyromental distance < 65 mm, interincisor distance < 35 mm) were enrolled (FIB group, n = 49; ILMA group, n = 51) in this prospective randomized study. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with alfentanil and propofol after an efficient mask ventilation has been demonstrated. The success of the technique (within three attempts), the number of attempts, duration of the successful attempt, and adverse events (oxygen saturation < 90%, bleeding) were recorded. Results: The rate of successful tracheal intubation with ILMA was 94% and comparable with FIB (92%). The number of attempts and the time to succeed were not significantly different between groups. In case of failure of the first technique, the alternative technique always succeeded. Failures in FIB group were related to oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation < 90%) and bleeding, and to previous cervical radiotherapy in the ILMA group. Adverse events occurred significantly more frequently in FIB group than in ILMA group (18 vs. 0%, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The authors obtained a high success rate and comparable duration of tracheal intubation with ILMA and FIB techniques. In patients with previous cervical radiotherapy, the use of ILMA cannot be recommended. Nevertheless, the use of the ILMA was associated with fewer adverse events.",0,0
4041656,Respiratory function in recent pulmonary sarcoidosis with special reference to small airways,"This study was designed to evaluate airway dysfunction in relation to duration of disease in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis for less than two years. Twenty four subjects with recent disease were compared with nine subjects with disease of more than two years' duration. They underwent lung function testing (lung volumes, lung transfer factor for CO and pulmonary mechanics). Small airway function was assessed using frequency dependence of compliance, closing volume, nitrogen single breath test and flow-volume curves breathing air and helium-oxygen mixture. Airway dysfunction was seen in pulmonary sarcoidosis even in some patients with recent disease and it became more evident in disease of longer duration. The results suggest small airway involvement. The frequency of airway dysfunction is difficult to evaluate, varying from estimates of 0% using flow-volume curves to 79% with frequency dependence of compliance. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by the consequences of parenchymal involvement leading to inhomogeneities in distribution of compliance, and of elastic lung recoil. We conclude that patients with recent sarcoidosis are probably affected by intrinsic small airway disease, but an increase in elastic recoil often conceals its consequences. The airway disease may not be apparent using conventional function tests and published predicted values.",0,0
19444571,Difficult laryngoscopy caused by massive mandibular tori,"Mandibular tori, defined as bony protuberances located along the lingual aspect of the mandible, are a possible cause of difficult intubation. We describe a case of mandibular tori that resulted in difficult intubation. A 62-year-old woman who had speech problems was diagnosed with mandibular tori, and was scheduled for surgical resection. On physical assessment, the patient had a class II Mallampati view and bilateral mandibular tori. Preoperative computed tomography images demonstrated that the bilateral mandibular tori arose from the lingual aspects of the second incisor to the first molar regions of the mandibular corpus, and occupied the floor of the mouth. In the operating room, anesthesia was induced with remifentanil and propofol. After complete paralysis was achieved, laryngoscopy was attempted several times with Macintosh blades. The massive tori prevented insertion of the tip of the blade into the oropharynx, and neither the epiglottis nor the arytenoids could be visualized, i.e., Cormack and Lehane grade IV. Blind nasotracheal intubation was successful and the surgery proceeded uneventfully. The anesthesiologist should examine any space-occupying lesion of the oral floor and should be vigilant for speech problems in order to detect mandibular tori that might impede intubation.",0,0
21705176,[Airway management in obstetrics],"Objective: Reviewing problems related to the airway management in obstetrics, taking into account the recent evolutions of the anaesthetic practices in obstetrics. Data sources: A review of the literature in English and French was performed in the Pumed database in April 2010. The first research used the following MeshTerms: ""Anesthesia, Obstetrical"" [Mesh] AND ""Intubation, Intratracheal"" [Mesh]. Complementary research used alone or in combination the following keywords: difficult tracheal intubation; failed tracheal intubation; airway; prediction of difficult tracheal intubation; maternal mortality; maternal morbidity; liability; aspiration pneumonia and obstetrical anesthesia. Study selection: All the publications were retained excluding the correspondence. Data extraction: Data analysis for the airway management in obstetrics, the prediction of difficult intubation, the prevention of pulmonary inhalation of gastric fluid, but also on maternal morbi-mortality in link with general anesthesia in obstetrics. Data synthesis: Airway management in obstetrics remains a true challenge for various reasons. The physiological and anatomical modifications related to pregnancy are responsible for a faster hypoxemia, a reduction of the diameter of the pharyngolaryngal tract, as well as an increase of the risk of inhalation of gastric contents after 16 weeks of amenorrhea. The emergency or extreme emergency context and the presence of diseases like obesity or preeclampsia raise the risks of difficulties with airway management. The logical evolution of the practices, with the considerable rise of the regional anesthesia/analgesia limits the training and the maintenance of competences for intratracheal intubation in obstetrics. The training per simulation appears particularly interesting on the subject and this approach needs to be developed. The literature indicates that the incidence of difficult intubation is of one per 30. The impossible intubation is one per 280 in obstetrics, eight times greater than in the general population. No criterion of difficult intubation is sufficiently predictive alone. In obstetrics as in other contexts, the association of several criteria will permit to anticipate a difficult intubation. There is a worsening of the Mallampati during the pregnancy and during labour. To limit the risk of a difficult management of the airway in obstetrics, it will be paramount and capital, in addition to give priority to the regional anaesthesia/analgesia each time possible, to perform a careful and repeated evaluation of the predictive criteria of difficult intubation or ventilation. The inhalation of gastric fluid will systematically be prevented. The adapted material and algorithms for difficult intubation must be available in the labour wards. In case of a difficult intubation during an emergency caesarean section, the SFAR algorithms must be applied. In case of a ""cannot intubate can ventilate situation"", the possibility of carrying on the Caesarean maintaining the Sellick manoeuvre should be considered. The place of the laryngoscopy assisted by videolaryngoscope in this context clearly remains to be defined. Even if in the literature some cases of successful intubation through these devices suggest an interest, there is a clear deviance between the guidelines and the practices concerning general anaesthesia performed at the end of the labour. Indeed they should be systematically performed with rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation. A reflexion on this theme is necessary in order to grant the practices to the recommendations.",0,0
15310351,Interobserver reliability between a nurse and anaesthetist of tests used for predicting difficult tracheal intubation,"We examined the interobserver reliability, between a nurse and anaesthetist, of five tests used to predict difficult tracheal intubation: mouth opening; thyromental distance; head and neck movement; mandibular luxation; and assessment of oropharyngeal view. For each test, an anaesthetic nurse and a specialist registrar anaesthetist were trained to use a standard method of examination. Most of the tests had either good or very good reliability. Assessment of mouth opening demonstrated only moderate reliability and assessment of oropharyngeal view demonstrated poor reliability. The interobserver reliability estimates between a nurse and an anaesthetist are similar to those previously demonstrated between two anaesthetists.",0,0
18706246,Clinical experience of airway management and tracheal intubation under general anesthesia in patients with scar contracture of the neck,"Background: Because patients with scar contracture of the neck are at a high risk of loss of the airway control after anesthesia induction, awake intubation is usually recommended. This retrospective clinical study was designed to evaluate the possibility, safety and efficacy of airway management and tracheal intubation under general anesthesia in such patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 1683 patients from January 1994 to December 2006 with scar contracture of the neck, aged 1.5 - 67.0 years, who were scheduled for elective plastic surgery under general anesthesia in Plastic Surgery Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. Based on the results of the preoperative airway assessment, the patients were classified into group 1 (including 1375 patients with the atlanto-occipital extension of > 20 degrees and the Mallampatti's grade I or II) and group 2 (containing 308 patients with the atlanto-occipital extension of < 20 degrees and the Mallampatti's grade III or IV. In group 1, the intravenous induction and maintenance of anesthesia and succinylcholine for muscle relaxation were used. The intubation was done using a modified Macintosh technique. In group 2, the total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or the sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia was chosen and the spontaneous breathing was reserved during anesthesia. The intubation was performed by a fiberoptic stylet laryngoscope (FOSL). The number of intubation attempts, intubation time and relative complications were observed and recorded in all patients. Results: In group 1, the intubation was accomplished during the first attempt in 1279 cases (93%) and the intubation time was < 3 minutes in 1304 cases (95%). In group 2, the intubation was completed by the first attempt in 114 patients (37%) and 123 patients had an intubation time of < 3 minutes (40%). Tracheal intubation was successful by the second or third attempt in 96 patients in group 1 and 156 patients in group 2. Thirty-eight patients required four or more attempts which only occurred in group 2. The incidence of traumatic complication was 2.6% and 9.7% with one intubation attempt in groups 1 and 2, respectively, 12.5% and 17.0% with multiple intubation attempts (one vs multiple attempts in both groups, P < 0.001). All non-traumatic complications occurred in group 2 and laryngospasm and hypoxemia were more common in patients using the TIVA compared to those using the sevoflurane inhalational anesthesia (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that with a precise airway evaluation, an adequate preoperative preparation and a pre-planned failed intubation strategy, the anesthetist who was experienced in the difficult airway management could safely perform airway control and tracheal intubation under general anesthesia in patients with scar contracture of the neck. We believe that this technique may be very valuable for the management of a known difficult airway because it is comfortable for the patient and saves time for the anesthetist.",0,0
16006487,Reduction in mouth opening with semi-rigid cervical collars,"Background: Reduced mouth opening may be a major contributing factor to the deterioration in the view obtained at laryngoscopy when a semi-rigid cervical collar is in place. We set out to assess the degree to which mouth opening is restricted by a cervical collar. Methods: We measured maximal inter-incisor distance in 52 volunteers. It was measured again after application of each of three appropriately sized semi-rigid cervical collars (Stifneck, Miami J, and Philadelphia). Results: Inter-incisor distance was significantly reduced by the application of a cervical collar [No collar 41 (7) mm-mean (SD); Stifneck 26 (8) P<0.0001; Miami J 29 (9) P<0.0001; Philadelphia 29 (9) P<0.0001]. There was a wide and unpredictable variation between subjects in the reduction in mouth opening and a significant proportion had an inter-incisor distance of 20 mm or less (Stifneck, 25%; Miami J, 21%; Philadelphia, 21%). Conclusions: Application of a semi-rigid cervical collar can significantly reduce mouth opening. This could hinder definitive airway placement. Our results support removing the anterior portion of the collar before attempts at tracheal intubation.",0,0
11812720,The modified nasal trumpet maneuver,"The last decade has witnessed a proliferation of devices or methods that facilitate intubation in difficult circumstances, maintain ventilation, or which do both. These all require properly functioning and specially designed apparatus, the use of which requires variable degrees of expertise. This technical communication describes the author's experience with a simple technique that uses virtually universally available materials--a nasal trumpet (airway) and an endotracheal tube (ETT) connector--to rescue patients in the cannot-ventilate/cannot-intubate scenario. The methodology is straightforward, ventilation is usually immediate, stomach contents can be evacuated while ventilation proceeds, and it does not require mouth opening. Moreover, while ventilation and oxygenation is continuing, a fiber-optic intubation can proceed without interference. Implications: A simple technique is proposed that can be used to rescue patients who are in a condition of cannot intubate/cannot ventilate. The described maneuver may save patients from requiring a surgical airway.",0,0
10551574,Evaluation of tracheal intubation difficulty in patients with cervical spine immobilization: fiberoptic (WuScope) versus conventional laryngoscopy,"Background: The WuScope is a rigid, fiberoptic laryngoscope designed to facilitate tracheal intubation without the need for head extension. The study evaluated the WuScope in anesthetized patients with neck immobilization. Methods: Patients were randomized to one of two groups: those receiving fiberoptic laryngoscopy (WuScope, n = 43) and those receiving conventional laryngoscopy (Macintosh blade, n = 44). Manual in-line stablization of the cervical spine was done during intubation. Seven parameters of intubation difficulty were measured (providing an intubation difficulty scale score): number of operators, number of attempts, number of techniques, Cormack view, lifting force, laryngeal pressure, and vocal cord position. Results: Successful intubation occurred in 95% of patients in the fiberoptic group and in 93% of patients in the conventional group. There were no differences in number of attempts. In the fiberoptic group, 79% of patients had an intubation difficulty scale score of 0, representing an ideal intubation: that is, one performed by the first operator on the first attempt using the first technique with full glottic visualization. Only 18% of patients in the conventional group had an intubation difficulty scale score of 0 (P < 0.001). More patients had Cormack grade 3 or 4 views with conventional than with fiberoptic laryngoscopy (39 vs. 2%, P < 0.001). Intubation times in patients with one attempt were slightly longer in the fiberoptic (median, 25th-75th percentiles: 30, 23-53 s) compared with the conventional group (24, 17-30 s, P < 0.05). Corresponding times in patients requiring > one attempt were 155 (range, 112-201) s and 141 (range, 95-186) s in the fiberoptic and conventional groups, respectively (P value not significant). Conclusions: Compared with conventional laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation using the fiberoptic laryngoscope was associated with lower intubation difficulty scale scores and better views of the laryngeal aperture in patients with cervical imnmobilization. However, there were no differences in success rates or number of intubation attempts.",0,0
20357149,"Tracheal intubation of a difficult airway using Airway Scope, Airtraq, and Macintosh laryngoscope: a comparative manikin study of inexperienced personnel","Background: The Airway Scope (AWS) (Pentax-AWS, Hoya Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and the Airtraq (ATQ) (Prodol, Vizcaya, Spain) have similarities in the novel structures of their blades. In this study, we evaluated the ease of use of the AWS and ATQ compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope (ML) by inexperienced personnel in a simulated manikin difficult airway. Methods: Twenty-four fifth-year medical students with no previous experience in tracheal intubation participated in this study. We used an advanced patient simulator (SimMan(R), Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway) to simulate difficult airway scenarios including cervical spine rigidity, limited mouth opening, and pharyngeal obstruction. The sequences in selecting devices and scenarios were randomized. Success rates for tracheal intubation, and the time required for visualization of the glottis, tracheal intubation, and inflation of the lungs, and the number of optimization maneuvers and dental click sounds were analyzed. The 3 different intubation devices were tested in 4 different scenarios by 24 students. Results: Both the AWS and ATQ had very high success rates of tracheal intubation compared with the ML (AWS 100%*; ATQ 98%*; and ML 89%; *P < 0.05 AWS, ATQ versus ML). The time to intubation with the AWS was significantly shorter than with the ATQ and ML (AWS 11 +/- 6 seconds; ATQ 16 +/- 12 seconds; and ML 16 +/- 11 seconds; *P < 0.05 AWS versus ATQ, ML). The number of optimization maneuvers with the AWS was significantly lower than with the ATQ and ML. There were significantly more audible dental click sounds with the ML than with the AWS and ATQ. Conclusion: Both the AWS and ATQ may be suitable devices for difficult intubation by inexperienced personnel in this manikin simulated scenario. Further studies in a clinical setting are necessary to confirm these findings.",0,0
1626673,"Forces applied during laryngoscopy and their relationship with patient characteristics. Influence of height, weight, age, sex and presence of maxillary incisors","The relationships between patients' height, weight, age, body mass index, gender and presence of maxillary incisors and a series of laryngoscopic factors have been studied. These included the duration of laryngoscopy, maximally applied force, mean applied force and the integral of force over time. There was a positive correlation between height and weight and laryngoscopic factors. Sex and age also showed a positive correlation but these could be explained by differences in height, weight and the presence of maxillary incisors. This latter factor was the dominant patient characteristic influencing the measured laryngoscopic factors. Use of these laryngoscopic factors as a measure of difficulty of laryngoscopy is discussed.",0,0
23704425,Misguidance of peroral rigid laryngoscopy in assessment of difficult airway: two comparable cases in microlaryngeal surgery,"We describe two patients with laryngeal cyst who underwent microlaryngeal surgery. Peroral rigid laryngoscopy, as an indirect endoscopy, performed via the transoral route, was evaluated as a routine screening tool of the difficult airway in patients with laryngeal neoplasm, in our hospital preoperatively. Peroral rigid laryngoscopy had led to two different procedures: One patient was misdiagnosed as having a difficult airway by the ear, nose and throat surgeon resulting in an unnecessary awake tracheotomy. The other patient was found to be with an unanticipated difficult intubation following routine anaesthesia, successful on the third attempt. As we saw in these two cases, endoscopic examination alone was inadequate for the assessment of a difficult airway, which may also lack the predictive sensitivity or may cause a high false positive. Usage of video laryngoscopy combined with intubating stylet will improve the intubation success in patients with huge epiglottic cyst.",0,0
16517431,Evaluation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness by monitoring of transcutaneous oxygen tension and arterial oxygen saturation during methacholine challenge in asthmatic children,"Background: Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is a key feature of asthma, but the measurement of BHR is hampered by the fact that most tests of airway caliber are difficult to conduct at a young age. Methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction is associated with significant hypoxemia, which can be assessed noninvasively by transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) and pulse oximetry. Evaluating BHR by monitoring tcPO2 instead of respiratory resistance (Rrs) has been used over a wide age range in childhood. Objective: To investigate whether there is a consistent relationship between changes in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and respiratory resistance (Rrs) similar to the relationship between tcPO2 and Rrs during methacholine challenge in young children and to assess the usefulness of SaO2 as a parameter for the indirect measurement of BHR. Method: We performed methacholine inhalation challenge by monitoring SaO2, tcPO2 and Rrs in 37 asthmatic children 5 to 7 years of age. Consecutive doses of methacholine were doubled until a 10% decrease in tcPO2 from the baseline was reached. We recorded the cumulative dose of methacholine (Dmin) at the inflection point of tcPO2 (Dmin-tcPO2), SaO2 (Dmin-SaO2), and Rrs(Dmin-Rrs). Results: The mean value of Dmin-Rrs was 4.27 +/- 2.02 units, the mean value of Dmin-tcPO2 was 4.48 +/- 2.01 units, and the mean value of Dmin-SaO2 was 4.57 +/- 0.20 units. Inhalation of increasing doses of methacholine raised Rrs curvilinearly and depressed tcPO2 and SaO2. There were no significant differences between any of the parameters. There were significant relationships between Dmin-tcPO2 and Dmin-Rrs (r = 0.914, p < 0.001) and between Dmin-SaO2 and Dmin-Rrs (r = 0.905, p < 0.001) and a relationship between Dmin-tcPO2 and Dmin-SaO2 (r = 0.949, p < 0.001). Conclusion: We concluded that measurement of SaO2 and/or tcPO2 during methacholine inhalation challenge may be used to assess bronchial hyperresponsiveness. This study showed that both SaO2 and tcPO2 monitoring are safe, useful, and tolerable for use in children who are too young to cooperate with lung function tests.",0,0
20532072,Optimal external laryngeal manipulation versus McCoy blade in active position in patients with poor view of glottis on direct laryngoscopy,"Successful endotracheal intubation requires a clear view of glottis. Optimal external laryngeal manipulation may improve the view of glottis on direct laryngoscopy with Macintosh blade, but it requires another trained hand. Alternatively, McCoy laryngoscope with elevated tip may be useful. This study has been designed to compare the two techniques in patients with poor view of glottis. Two hundred patients with 'Grade 2 or more' view of glottis on direct laryngoscopy with Macintosh blade are included in the study. Optimal external laryngeal manipulation was applied, followed by laryngoscopy with McCoy blade in activated position; and the view was noted in both situations. The two interventions were compared using Chi-square test. The overall changes, in the views, were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed rank test. Both the techniques improved the view of glottis significantly (P<0.05). Optimal external laryngeal manipulation was significantly better than McCoy laryngoscope in active position, especially in patients with Grade 3 or 4 baseline view, poor oropharyngeal class, decreased head extension and decreased submandibular space (odds ratio = 2.36, 3.17, 3.22 and 26.48 respectively). To conclude, optimal external laryngeal manipulation is a better technique than McCoy laryngoscope in patients with poor view of glottis on direct laryngoscopy with Macintosh blade.",0,0
12088818,Current status of the Combitube: a review of the literature,"The Combitube (Tyco-Healthcare-Kendall-Sheridan, Mansfield, MA) is an easily inserted and highly efficacious device to be used as an alternative airway whenever conventional ventilation fails. The Combitube allows ventilation and oxygenation whether the device locates in the esophagus (very common) or the trachea (rare). In this report, we review studies that suggest the Combitube is a valuable and effective airway in the emergency and prehospital settings, in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, in elective surgery, and in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Also reviewed are studies that demonstrate the superiority of the Combitube over other supraglottic ventilatory devices in resuscitation with respect to success rates with insertion and ventilation. Contrary to the Laryngeal Mask Airway, the Combitube may help in patients with limited mouth opening. The Combitube may be of special benefit in patients with massive bleeding or regurgitation, and it minimizes the risk of aspiration.",0,0
23866436,Comparison of upper lip bite test with Mallampati test in the prediction of difficult intubation at a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan,"Objective: To determine the accuracy of the Upper lip bite test and Mallampati test in predicting difficult endotracheal intubation. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, a tertiary care facility in Karachi, Pakistan. Between June 1,2007 and May 31, 2008, 324 adult patients undergoing elective surgeries requiring general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubations were enrolled. Pre-operatively upper lip bite test and Mallampati test were performed for the assessment of airway by a specifically trained observer. Laryngoscopic view was rated by using Cormack and Lehane laryngoscopic grading once the patient was fully anaesthetised using standard anaesthesia technique. Completed data sheets were analysed using SPSS version 10. McNemar test and rank correlation coefficient were used to compare the upper lip bite test and the Mallampati test. Results: Of the 324 patients, 56 (17.3%) were classified as cases of difficult intubation. Upper lip bite test showed significantly higher accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value than the Mallampati test. Comparison of specificity, however, did not reveal any significant difference between the two tests. Conclusion: Upper lip bite test is an acceptable alternative as a single test to predict difficult intubation in addition to other tests of airway assessment for the prediction of difficult intubation.",1,1
7880227,"Assessment of upper airway anatomy in awake, sedated and anaesthetised patients using magnetic resonance imaging","Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used to quantify the effects of 1. sedation and 2. general anaesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in place on the minimum antero-posterior (A-P) diameters of the naso-, oro- and hypopharynx and on the angle of the epiglottis relative to the adjacent posterior pharyngeal wall. Median sagittal T1-weighted images of the pharynx were obtained in 46 patients (16 awake, 14 sedated, 16 under general anaesthesia). In sedated patients, the A-P diameters of the pharynx were less than in awake patients, in particular at the levels of the epiglottis and soft palate. General anaesthesia and placement of a LMA was also associated with a reduced A-P diameter at the level of the soft palate, but with increased diameters at the levels of the tongue and epiglottis. Placement of a LMA caused abnormal downfolding of the epiglottis in most cases but this did not cause clinically significant airway obstruction.",0,0
10671846,The effect of cricoid pressure on the cricoid cartilage and vocal cords: an endoscopic study in anaesthetised patients,"Cricoid pressure is used to protect the lungs from contamination with gastric contents during tracheal intubation. We studied the effect of cricoid pressure applied with a yoke on 30 anaesthetised patients examined fibreoptically through a laryngeal mask airway. We assessed the effect of 20, 30 and 44 N on the internal appearance of the cricoid and vocal cords. Difficulty in ventilation was also recorded. At 44 N, cricoid deformation occurred in 27/30 patients (90%) and 15/30 (50%) had cricoid occlusion [13/30 (43%) had cricoid occlusion at 30 N and 7/30 (23%) at 20 N]. Associated difficulty in ventilation was present in 15 patients (50%) and 18/30 (60%) had vocal cord closure with associated difficult ventilation, at forces up to 44 N. Cricoid occlusion was unrelated to age and body mass index but females were at greater risk. Orthodox values of cricoid pressure, applied with a yoke, may produce obstruction at the level of the cricoid cartilage or vocal cords, with implications for tracheal intubation and ventilation by mask.",0,0
21192270,CobraPLUS and Cookgas air-Q versus Fastrach for blind endotracheal intubation: a randomised controlled trial,"Background and objective: CobraPLUS and Cookgas air-Q are supraglottic airways expected to allow safe ventilation as well as reliable blind intubation. In a prospective, controlled trial, we hypothesised that quality of ventilation and success rate of blind endotracheal intubation of these new devices would be superior to the Fastrach intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA). When blind intubation failed the quality of fibrescope-guided intubation was investigated. To allow identification of those patients in whom blind intubation would be difficult, we investigated the predictive value of currently used predictors for ease of endotracheal intubation. Methods: One hundred and eighty adult patients with documented BMI, Mallampati score, Cormack-Lehane classification, interincisor gap and thyromental distance were randomised into three groups according to the device used. Ventilation conditions were rated as excellent, good or difficult. When blind intubation failed, fibrescope-guided intubation conditions were rated as well. Statistical analysis was performed by a χ-test. Results: The quality of ventilation was excellent for all devices. Three patients in the CobraPLUS group and two patients in the ILMA and the Cookgas groups needed a slight reposition. Blind intubation through the CPLA was successful in 47%, through the Cookgas in 57%, whereas the Fastrach group had a success rate of 95%. Fibreoptic intubation was possible in all but one patient. None of the registered scores and measures allowed prediction of difficult blind intubation. Conclusion: All devices appeared to be safe airways. The Fastrach ILMA proved to be a reliable facilitator for blind intubation. CobraPLUS and Cookgas air-Q allowed an easy fibrescopic intubation. Failed blind intubations could not be predicted by the used parameters.",0,0
9252876,Endoscopic scoring system in patients with allergic rhinitis,"Visual inspection of the airways in patients with chronic bronchitis and asthma by fiberoptic bronchoscopy and the relation of these findings to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis or some clinical parameters have been reported previously. In this study, we have attempted to assess and grade airway inflammation in allergic rhinitis patients (ARP) by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. During the procedure, BAL was obtained and visual inspection of airways done by the method used by Thompson et al. Ten ARP with bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) (Group 1), 10 ARP without BHR (Group 2) and 2 nonatopic, healthy subjects (Control Group) were studied. The fluid recovery and differential cell concentration were similar in the three groups. The inflammatory scores were 11.0 +/- 7.0, 13.8 +/- 6.9, 15.0 +/- 4.2 in group 1, group 2 and control group, respectively, without showing any significant differences between the groups. There was no correlation between the inflammatory score and PC20 to methacholine. This indicates that BHR in ARP will need explanations other than the inflammation within airways.",0,0
25791918,Laryngeal morphologic changes and epidemiology in patients with inhalation injury: a retrospective study,"Background and objectives: Laryngeal morphologic changes are important in risk assessment of upper airway obstruction (UAO) after inhalation injury. This retrospective study evaluates the clinical application of laryngeal burn classification system. Materials and methods: Clinical data from January 1999 to June 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. The following data collected: age, gender, total burned surface area (TBSA), third-degree burn surface area, co-morbid injuries and complications, proportion of patients with tracheotomy, interval between tracheotomy and injury, incidence and mortality of UAO, and reasons for death. Results: Four hundred and forty-three patients were included; 405 patients underwent multiple fibro-laryngoscopic observation, of which I, II and III types of laryngeal burns were present in 49.9, 38.0, and 12.1% patients, respectively. Laryngeal burn severity was related to TBSA and third-degree burn surface area. Overall tracheotomy rate (n=443) was 37.02%. The mean interval between tracheotomy and injury was 10.0±12.17h. Over 75% patients underwent tracheotomy within 12h. Compared with moderate inhalation burn group, the severe inhalation burn group showed a significantly higher tracheotomy rate within 12h and a significantly shorter interval between tracheotomy and injury. Patient mortality was significantly related to the severity of inhalation injury. Conclusion: The classification system of the morphologic laryngeal changes in laryngeal burn patients could effectively evaluate the UAO risk, enable earlier prophylactic tracheotomy after UAO onset, reduce surgical difficulties and risks, decrease clinical pressure of doctors, and prevent UAO. Laryngeal burn severity was related to TBSA and mortality and may be an important severity and prognosis indicator of inhalation injury.",0,0
21391796,"The assessment of airway maneuvers and interventions in university Canadian football, ice hockey, and soccer players","Context: Managing an airway in an unconscious athlete is a lifesaving skill that may be made more difficult by the recent changes in protective equipment. Different airway maneuvers and techniques may be required to help ventilate an unconscious athlete who is wearing full protective equipment. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of different airway maneuvers with football, ice hockey, and soccer players wearing full protective equipment. Design: Crossover study. Setting: University sports medicine clinic. Patients or other participants: A total of 146 university varsity athletes, consisting of 62 football, 45 ice hockey, and 39 soccer players. Intervention(s): Athletes were assessed for different airway and physical characteristics. Three investigators then evaluated the effectiveness of different bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation techniques in supine athletes who were wearing protective equipment while inline cervical spine immobilization was maintained. Main outcome measure(s): The effectiveness of 1-person BVM ventilation (1-BVM), 2-person BVM ventilation (2-BVM), and inline immobilization and ventilation (IIV) was judged by each investigator for each athlete using a 4-point rating scale. Results: All forms of ventilation were least difficult in soccer players and most difficult in football players. When compared with 1-BVM, both 2-BVM and IIV were deemed more effective by all investigators for all athletes. Interference from the helmet and stabilizer were common reasons for difficult ventilation in football and ice hockey players. Conclusions: Sports medicine professionals should practice and be comfortable with different ventilation techniques for athletes wearing full equipment. The use of a new ventilation technique, termed inline immobilization and ventilation, may be beneficial, especially when the number of responders is limited.",0,0
24700402,Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia: Continuing Professional Development,"Purpose: Whenever possible, neuraxial anesthesia is the preferred technique for Cesarean delivery; however, under certain circumstances, general anesthesia remains the most appropriate choice. The purpose of this Continuing Professional Development module is to review the key issues regarding general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery. Principal findings: In developed countries, anesthesia-related maternal mortality and morbidity are both low. Mortality following Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia is attributable chiefly to failed intubation or other induction-related issues. Extubation can also be a danger period. The various methods of preventing difficult intubation and the associated consequences include airway assessment, fasting during obstetric labour, and pharmacological prophylaxis for aspiration. The traditional rapid sequence induction has been slightly modified because of the increased use of propofol and remifentanil. Difficult airway management algorithms specific to the pregnant woman are being developed and tend to recommend the use of supraglottic devices for unanticipated difficult intubation. The prevention of intraoperative awareness is another major consideration. Maintenance with halogenated agents at > 0.7 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is recommended; however, propofol maintenance can be an interesting option when uterine atony is present. Multimodal postoperative analgesia is recommended. Conclusion: A general anesthetic for Cesarean delivery should be based on the following principles: preventing aspiration, anticipating a difficult intubation, maintaining oxygenation, insuring materno-feto-placental perfusion and maintaining a deep level of anesthesia to avoid intraoperative awareness while minimizing neonatal effects.",0,0
24864577,"[Successful intubation in a difficult case using an Ambu Laryngeal Mask Angle Type-i, and the ability to pass a gastric tube behind the laryngeal mask]","A 71-year-old male was scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The plan was to intubate him using direct laryngoscopy. After induction of anesthesia and analgesia direct laryngoscopy was performed but it was difficult to get a good view of epiglottis, and at 2nd attempt there was laryngeal edema, which made the procedure more difficult. The patient was then ventilated with a facemask and it was decided to intubate him with an Ambu Laryngeal Mask Angle Type-i (Aura-i) and a bronchofiberscope. The procedure worked, and the patient was successfully intubated. We did not want to remove the Aura-i due to concerns about losing the airway. Therefore, we decided to place the gastric tube with the Aura-i still inserted. Therefore the cuff of the Aura-i was deflated and we were able to easily pass a gastric tube behind the Aura-i type easily. After the operation, the patient was extubated from the trachea with the Aura-i still in place. When sufficient respiration returned, the Aura-i was removed. There was no bleeding in the mouth after removal of the Aura-i.",0,0
17323663,Ultrasound quantification of anterior soft tissue thickness fails to predict difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients,"Morbid obesity is associated with difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. In the general population, bedside indices for predicting difficult intubation (i.e. Mallampati classification, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, mouth-opening and Wilson risk score) have poor-to-moderate sensitivity (20-62%) and moderate-to-fair specificity (82-97%). In the obese population, although the risk of difficult intubation after a positive Mallampati test is 34%, it is still not sufficient to be used as a single predictive test. An abundance of pretracheal soft tissue anterior to the vocal cords, as quantified by ultrasound, was a better predictor of difficult laryngoscopy than body mass index (BMI) in Israeli patients. Obesity is a growing problem in the United States: therefore we sought to confirm this finding in the obese population in the United States. We used ultrasound to quantify the neck soft tissue, from the skin to the anterior aspect of the trachea at the vocal cords, in 64 obese patients (BMI > 35). We assessed thyromental distance, mouth-opening, jaw movement, limited neck mobility, modified Mallampati score, abnormal upper teeth, neck circumference, confirmed obstructive sleep apnoea, BMI, age, race and gender as predictors. Twenty patients were classified as difficult laryngoscopy; they were older (47 +/- 9 vs 42 +/- 1 years; P = 0.048; mean +/- SD) and had less soft pretracheal tissue (20.4 +/- 3.0 vs 22.3 +/- 3.8 mm; P = 0.049) than did easy laryngoscopy patients. Multivariate regression indicated that none of the factors was an independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy. We conclude that the thickness of pretracheal soft tissue at the level of the vocal cords is not a good predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients in the United States.",1,1
9102587,[Light-guided intubation using Trachlight],"Background: A new intubating transilluminated device (Trachlight) has been recently proposed as an alternative to tracheal intubation with direct laryngoscopy. Objective: 1) To evaluate Trachlight device in orotracheal intubation and to assess its operation and complications. 2) To compare the time consumption of transillumination intubation in respect to direct laryngoscopy on the same patients. Methods: The first study was performed on 50 patients undergoing elective surgery and submitted to Trachlight intubation alone; speed of intubation, number of attempts and all complications were recorded and related to Mallampati classes. In the second study 16 patients undergoing to elective surgery were enrolled. Each patient was classified according to both the Mallampati classes and the Cormack classes. Each patient was submitted to two tracheal intubations: the first with the Trachlight and the second with conventional direct laryngoscopy performed by the same anesthesiologist. The time to intubation and the number of attempts were recorded and related to the Mallampati and Cormack classes. Results: In the first study time of intubation with Trachlight was 20.93 +/- 13.02s (mean +/- SD) without statistical differences in respect to the Mallampati classes. In the second study the times to intubation were without any statistical difference independently of the technique of intubation and of the Mallampati or Cormack classes. Conclusions: Orotracheal intubation using Trachlight appears to be an effective and easy to learn technique, being also easy, safe and fast to carry out. The comparison with direct laryngoscopy showed the same speed and effectiveness even on patients with difficult intubation.",0,0
22340664,"Incidence and predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in 11,219 pediatric anesthesia procedures","Objective: Difficult laryngoscopy in pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia. Aim: This retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate incidence and predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in a large cohort of pediatric patients receiving general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Background: Young age and craniofacial dysmorphy are predictors for the difficult pediatric airway and difficult laryngoscopy. For difficult laryngoscopy, other general predictors are not yet described. Methods: Retrospectively, from a 5-year period, data from 11.219 general anesthesia procedures in pediatric patients with endotracheal intubation using age-adapted Macintosh blades in a single center (university hospital) were analyzed statistically. Results: The overall incidence of difficult laryngoscopy [Cormack and Lehane (CML) grade III and IV] was 1.35%. In patients younger than 1 year, the incidence of CML III or IV was significantly higher than in the older patients (4.7% vs 0.7%). ASA Physical Status III and IV, a higher Mallampati Score (III and IV) and a low BMI were all associated (P < 0.05) with difficult laryngoscopy. Patients undergoing oromaxillofacial surgery and cardiac surgery showed a significantly higher rate of CML III/IV findings. Conclusion: The general incidence of difficult laryngoscopy in pediatric anesthesia is lower than in adults. Our results show that the risk of difficult laryngoscopy is much higher in patients below 1 year of age, in underweight patients and in ASA III and IV patients. The underlying disease might also contribute to the risk. If the Mallampati score could be obtained, prediction of difficult laryngoscopy seems to be reliable. Our data support the existing recommendations for a specialized anesthesiological team to provide safe anesthesia for infants and neonates.",0,0
8087134,In vivo assessment of airway inflammation,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are chronic inflammatory diseases which cause considerable morbidity and mortality. A number of in vivo methods have been developed to assess airway inflammation both to study mechanistic factors leading to airway inflammation as well as to assess disease activity. These have included non-invasive tests such as pulmonary function testing, bronchial provacation testing and nuclear medicine scans. Bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoscopic derived biopsies of the airways have provided information regarding cell populations and inflammatory mediators involved in the pathogenesis of chronic airway and lung inflammation. Induced sputum may become a less invasive means to sample the lower respiratory tract in patients with these disorders.",0,0
17717241,Easy endotracheal intubation of a patient suffering from both Cushing's and Nelson's syndromes predicted by the upper lip bite test despite a Mallampati Class 4 airway,"A 31-yr-old woman with concurrent Cushing's and Nelson's syndromes was scheduled for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The patient had generalized edema, morbid obesity, and a history of sleep apnea. Her Mallampati assessment was Class 4, suggesting very difficult intubation, but the upper lip bite test predicted easy intubation. After rapid sequence induction, there was a Class 1 view on laryngoscopy, and intubation was accomplished easily.",0,0
2058834,[Tooth injuries during intubation: a new preventive device],"This study analyses 126 cases of dental injuries occurring during endotracheal intubation, reported to the service of litigations of the hospitals in Lyon over a ten-year period, and giving rise to a complaint. The overall rate was 1 out of 4,000 cases of intubation. The true incidence may be greater. As expected, the upper jaw teeth are most often involved, especially the left incisors. Among them 24.3% of the involved teeth were normal. Dental fractures were the most common lesion, together with total or partial dislocations. A questionnaire was sent to 534 anaesthetists to assess the main difficulties which they encounter when carrying out endotracheal intubation. The results of this enquiry demonstrated that anaesthetists were very aware of dental risks when carrying out intubation, and that there was a lack of efficient protective measures. Among them 81.2% claimed they would use a protective device from time to time, and 17.4% routinely, if one were available. Therefore we designed such a device. It is gutter-shaped, made with two different plastics, the more rigid one being on the outside. It fits over the upper jaw teeth. There is an indentation in the front, to check whether the device is placed correctly. The inner surface is made of foam which dulls the pressure which may be exerted on the device during intubation. This device was tested in 108 patients. Intubation was easy with the device in place in 73.2% of patients; mouth opening was reduced by a mean of 4.2 +/- 0.5 mm. The device made intubation more difficult, and even impossible, in patients whose mouth opened no more than 3.5 cm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
24459620,Evaluation of the new supraglottic airway S.A.L.T to aid blind orotracheal intubation: A pilot study,"Background and objective: Supraglottic Airway Laryngopharyngeal Tube (S.A.L.T) is a new airway gadget conceived as an effective device to facilitate blind oro-tracheal intubation. Literature review showed no available clinical study on human subjects. The aim of our study was to evaluate S.A.L.T as an adjunct to blind oro-tracheal intubation. Study design: Single centre, Single group, Open label, Prospective, Interventional pilot study. Study group: 30 adult patients of either sex belonging to ASA I and II, scheduled for elective surgery under General anaesthesia. Patients were pre-medicated with inj. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and inj. Midazolam 2 mg and induced with Inj. Propofol 2 mg/kg IV. After inj. Suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg IV, S.A.L.T was inserted and a size 7.0 ID cuffed ETT was inserted through it immediately. The time period, from insertion of the S.A.L.T to the insertion of the ETT was noted. A successful intubation was defined as to insert SALT and intubate through it within 2 minutes irrespective of the number of attempts. Airway trauma, if any was recorded. Results: Only 40% of the patients were successfully intubated [(20.4% to 59.6% with 95% confidence interval (CI)]. The mean number of attempts required for intubation was 1.4 ± 0.67 (CI - 0.99 to 1.8) and the mean time for intubation was 26.3 ± 19.0 seconds (CI - 14.3 to 38.4 sec). Mallampati class I had more success rate than class III (P < 0.05). No airway trauma was recorded. Conclusion: S.A.L.T shows limited usefulness as an adjunct for aided blind oro-tracheal intubation.",0,0
20112545,[Use of the AirTraq device to manage difficult intubation in the awake patient],"Objective: To assess successful intubation, hemodynamic and respiratory stability, and patient wellbeing during awake orotracheal intubation using the AirTraq device in patients anticipated to have difficult airways. Patients and methods: Prospective observational study in patients who were candidates for awake intubation with the AirTraq device based on a score of 11 or more on the Arné test to predict a difficult airway. The 3 sets of variables assessed were intubation success, hemodynamic and respiratory stability, and subjective and objective measures of patient well-being. Results: Eleven patients were enrolled. Intubation was successful in 10 patients. Hemodynamic and respiratory stability was maintained in all cases. When well-being during intubation was subjectively assessed on a 10-point scale, the average score was 7.27 points on discharge from the recovery room and 7.45 points a month after the procedure. As objective reflections of well-being, nausea was reported by 5 patients, cough was recorded in 4 cases and agitation in 2. Conclusions: The AirTraq can be used for awake intubation in cases of anticipated difficult airway when other approaches to intubation have failed or are not viable. Intubation is achieved successfully and hemodynamic and respiratory stability maintained. The device is well tolerated. An advantage of the AirTraq is that it allows the glottis to be visualized as the endotracheal tube is being inserted between the vocal cords so damage can be minimized.",0,0
8317819,Intraepithelial mast cells in allergic and nonallergic asthma. Assessment using bronchial brushings,"Mast cell mediators are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. There is some disagreement concerning the numbers of mast cells in asthmatic mucosa. In this study a standardized bronchial brush technique was developed and used to assess intraepithelial mast cells and other inflammatory cells in allergic and nonallergic asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects. A total of 10 nonasthmatic (5 allergic) and 13 asthmatic (8 allergic) subjects with stable controlled asthma treated with beta-agonist only were assessed by history, spirometry, allergy prick tests, and methacholine airway responsiveness. During fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed from the middle lobe and standardized bronchial brushings were taken from the lingula and left lower lobe bronchi. Quantitative cell counts were performed blind to the clinical characteristics of the subjects. The average total cell recovery from the brushings was 1.04 (SEM 0.09) x 10(6) ml, with a cell viability of 64% (5.3%). Reproducible total cell and mast cell counts were obtained from brushings taken from two lobar bronchi (ICC 0.86). Mast cells were significantly elevated in asthmatic compared with nonasthmatic subjects (1.5 +/- 0.34 versus 0.15 +/- 0.06%). Allergic asthmatic subjects had the greatest numbers of mast cells (1.86 +/- 0.48%); however, the numbers present in brushings from nonallergic asthmatic subjects were also increased (1.03 +/- 0.45%). The mast cells had the staining characteristics of mucosal mast cells, with formalin-blockable metachromatic staining and positive staining for tryptase. Both asthmatic groups also had elevated BAL eosinophils, and neutrophils were elevated in nonallergic asthmatic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
11123743,Oesophageal perforation presenting as oesophageal atresia in a premature neonate following difficult intubation,"Iatrogenic oesophageal perforation in neonates is well recognized in the medical and surgical literature with intubation injury listed as a possible contributing mechanism besides nasogastric tube placement and suctioning. Diagnosis can be difficult and sometimes confused with other entities. With early diagnosis, nonsurgical management often leads to complete resolution in neonates. We report the case of a 1-day-old premature neonate who was brought to the operating room with the preliminary diagnosis of proximal oesophageal atresia with stump perforation and distal tracheo-esophageal fistula. His intubation for respiratory distress at birth had been difficult due to Pierre-Robin sequence with micrognathia. Oesophagoscopy in the operating room revealed a patent oesophagus but perforations in the pharynx and in the proximal oesophagus with the nasogastric tube entering the pharyngeal perforation. Oesophageal perforation and the limitations of the difficult airway algorithm in small neonates are discussed.",0,0
11444457,Removal of the connector on the laryngeal mask airway provides a useful alternative to the intubating laryngeal mask,"Purpose: We describe two cases in which fiberoptic intubation through the standard laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was successful with large-bore tracheal tubes (TTs) when an intubating LMA (ILMA) could not be used. Clinical features: Patient # 1, with obstructive sleep apnea, underwent elective surgical repair. His mouth opening was just under 25 mm, but difficult intubation was not anticipated. We induced general anesthesia, easily ventilated the patient by mask, and established neuromuscular blockade. Direct laryngoscopy and attempts to insert either a #5 or a #4 ILMA into the mouth failed. A standard #4 LMA, with the connector removed, was inserted, through which a 7.0 mm nasal RAE TT, fiberoptically guided, passed into the trachea at the first attempt. Patient #2, with a loosened implant after left hip arthroplasty, underwent revision prosthesis. Her neck movement was limited. We thus planned awake securing of the airway, but the patient refused. We induced anesthesia and established bag-mask-valve ventilation. The limited neck movement prevented direct laryngoscopy. Visualizing the laryngeal inlet with the fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) proved impossible as bloody secretions obscured the FOB's tip. Ventilation by mask was easy. As an ILMA was not available, we removed a #5 LMAs connector and passed an 8.0 mm nasal RAE TT through the LMA. Fiberoptic-guided intubation was easy. In both cases, the remainder of the intraoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion: A standard LMA whose connector has been removed to allow passage of TTs of >6.0 mm internal diameter may be substituted for the ILMA when necessary.",0,0
19097716,Morphological examination of upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea,"Objectives: An aim of this study was to assess the predictive power of an otorhinolaryngological examination of the upper airway to identify risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in the patients. Methods: We examined 141 consecutive patients with OSAS. The morphological features were assessed by the designated otorhinolaryngologist while the subjects were sitting relaxedly with tidal breathing. The bilateral nasal resistance was measured using the active anterior rhinomanometry during daytime wakefulness. Results: The body mass index (BMI), fauces's narrowness, neck circumference, lowest oxygen saturation, tonsil size and modified Mallampati grade (MMP) showed the statistically significant correlations with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of an index of apnoeseverity, however, the age, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), nasal resistance and retroglossal space were not significantly associated with the AHI. Conclusions: The upper airway morphology significantly associated with AHI are fauces's narrowness, tonsil size, and MMP, but not nasal resistance and retroglossal space.",0,0
12937025,Dynamic interaction between the tongue and soft palate during obstructive apnea in anesthetized patients with sleep-disordered breathing,"Little is known about the mechanisms of persistence of obstructive apnea. Structurally, the dorsum of the tongue locates anterior to the soft palate. On the basis of the observation of posterior displacement of the tongue during obstructive apnea, we hypothesized that the dorsum of the tongue pushes the anterior wall of the soft palate posteriorly during inspiratory efforts, maintaining closure at the retropalatal airway. To test this hypothesis, we measured the pressure between dorsum of the tongue and anterior wall of the soft palate (PT&P) during experimentally induced obstructive apneas in anesthetized patients with sleep-disordered breathing. P(T&P) changes during the obstruction significantly depended on collapsibility of the retroglossal airway. Progressive increase in the P(T&P) during obstructive apnea was observed only in patients with highly collapsible retroglossal airways. Significant increase in the P(T&P) during inspiratory effort in accordance with positive deflection pattern of P(T&P) tracing was evident in the patients with highly collapsible retroglossal airways. The results indicate significant dynamic interaction between the tongue and soft palate during both obstructive apnea and each inspiratory effort, possibly maintaining closure at the retropalatal airway.",0,0
2029389,Emergency ventilation using the Combitube in cases of difficult intubation,"The esophageal-tracheal Combitube (Sheridan, Argyle, NY) is a new device for emergency intubation, which can be inserted blindly without the use of a laryngoscope. Ventilation is independent of the position of the Combitube in either the esophagus or the trachea, since ventilation is always provided by the tube's double channel. The ""tracheal"" channel acts as a conventional endotracheal airway and has an open distal end. The ""esophageal"" channel has a blocked distal end, so that together with the inflated distal cuff it acts as an esophageal obturator in cases of esophageal intubation. Perforations at the pharyngeal section direct the airflow to the trachea. At the oropharyngeal section a large elastic balloon is positioned in order to obturate the oral cavity and the nasopharynx. Two patients are described to exemplify the Combitube's clinical use. Both had rapidly enlarging cervical hematomas causing upper airway obstruction and thus requiring immediate intubation. Endotracheal intubation failed because the glottis could not be visualized with a laryngoscope. In both cases the Combitube was applied successfully and adequate ventilation was provided via the Combitube placed esophageally. To better secure each patient's airway, tracheotomy was performed during ventilation without any complications.",0,0
24963183,Anatomic features of the neck as predictive markers of difficult direct laryngoscopy in men and women: A prospective study,"Background and aims: Difficult airway assessment is based on various anatomic parameters of upper airway, much of it being concentrated on oral cavity and the pharyngeal structures. The diagnostic value of tests based on neck anatomy in predicting difficult laryngoscopy was assessed in this prospective, open cohort study. Methods: We studied 341 adult patients scheduled to receive general anaesthesia. Thyromental distance (TMD), sternomental distance (STMD), ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD) and neck circumference (NC) were measured pre-operatively. The laryngoscopic view was classified according to the Cormack-Lehane Grade (1-4). Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as Cormack-Lehane Grade 3 or 4. The optimal cut-off points for each variable were identified by using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for each test. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression, including all variables, was used to create a predictive model. Comparisons between genders were also performed. Results: Laryngoscopy was difficult in 12.6% of the patients. The cut-off values were: TMD ≤7 cm, STMD ≤15 cm, RHTMD >18.4 and NC >37.5 cm. The RHTMD had the highest sensitivity (88.4%) and NPV (95.2%), while TMD had the highest specificity (83.9%). The area under curve (AUC) for the TMD, STMD, RHTMD and NC was 0.63, 0.64, 0.62 and 0.54, respectively. The predictive model exhibited a higher and statistically significant diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.68, P < 0.001). Gender-specific cut-off points improved the predictive accuracy of NC in women (AUC: 0.65). Conclusions: The TMD, STMD, RHTMD and NC were found to be poor single predictors of difficult laryngoscopy, while a model including all four variables had a significant predictive accuracy. Among the studied tests, gender-specific cut-off points should be used for NC.",0,0
24963182,Validation of modified Mallampati test with addition of thyromental distance and sternomental distance to predict difficult endotracheal intubation in adults,"Background and aims: Intubation is often a challenge for anaesthesiologists. Many parameters assist to predict difficult intubation. The present study was undertaken to assess the validity of different parameters in predicting difficult intubation for general anaesthesia (GA) in adults and effect of combining the parameters on the validity. Methods: The anaesthesiologist assessed oropharynx of 135 adult patients. Modified Mallampati test (MMT) was used and the thyromental distance (TMD) and sternomental distances (SMD) for each of the patients were also measured. The Cormack and Lehane laryngoscopic grading was assessed following laryngoscopy. The validity parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, false positive and negatives values, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The effect of combining different measurements on the validity was also studied. Univariate analysis was performed using the parametric method. Results: The study group comprised of 135 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of MMT were 28.6% and 93%, respectively. The TMD (<6.5 CM) had sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 75.8%, respectively. The SMD (<12.5 CM) had sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 92.7%, respectively. Combination of MMT grading and TMD and SMD measurements increased the validity (sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92.7%). Conclusion: MMT had high specificity. The validity of combination of MMT, SMD and TMD as compared to MMT alone was very high in predicting difficult intubation in adult patients. All parameters should be used in assessing an adult patient for surgery under GA.",1,1
23075453,The duration of fibre-optic intubation is increased by cricoid pressure. A randomised double-blind study,"Background: In some categories of patients, a rapid sequence induction using a fibre-optic method may be indicated. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of cricoid pressure (CP) on the duration of fibre-optic intubation. The hypothesis was that CP would prolong the intubation time. Methods: The study was a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study. The patients were intubated twice, in a randomised way, using a flexible fibrescope once with and once without CP. The intubation time and the visualisation of the glottis were registered. If the intubation was not completed within 180 s, it was registered as failed. CP was standardised to a pressure of 30 N. The data are given as the mean (standard deviation) or median [interquartile] (range). Results: Fifty patients were included, with a mean age of 53 years (14.6) and mean body mass index of 26.4 (4.3). Three intubations without and 13 intubations with CP failed. The durations of intubation without and with CP were 59 s [53-79 s] (34-144 s) and 75 s [67-104 s] (43-179 s), respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The study showed that CP prolongs the duration of fibre-optic intubation in patients with Mallampati grades 1-2.",0,0
20737961,[Relationship between adult craniofacial structures and development of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome],"Objective: To explore the influence of adult craniofacial structures on obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Method: This study compared the measurements of the height, body weight,neck circumference, the mallampati oropharyngeal score grading, thyromental distance, thyromental angle, lobule-mental distance, mental-lower lip distance of 50 patients with OSAHS with those of 50 controls. Result: Statistical findings showed that OSAHS patients were different from controls in the following ways: (1) higher neck circumference; (2) larger thyromental angle; (3) higher Mallampati scores; (4) higher body mass index; (5) shorter mental-lower lip distance. Conclusion: A crowded posterior oropharynx and a steep thyromental plane are associated with OSAHS. The adult craniofacial structures of bony and soft tissue determine the dimension of upper airway during sleep andpaly an important role in the development of OSAHS.",0,0
23878438,The prediction of difficult intubation in obese patients using mirror indirect laryngoscopy: A prospective pilot study,"Background: The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in obese patients is higher than in the general population. Classical predictors of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation have been shown to be unreliable. We prospectively evaluated indirect mirror laryngoscopy as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients. Materials and methods: 60 patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, scheduled to undergo general anesthesia, were enrolled. Indirect mirror laryngoscopy was performed and was graded 1-4 according to Cormack and Lehane. A view of grade 3-4 was classified as predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Additional assessments for comparison were the Samsoon and Young modification of the Mallampati airway classification, Wilson Risk Sum Score, neck circumference, and BMI. The view obtained upon direct laryngoscopy after induction of general anesthesia was classified according to Cormack and Lehane as grade 1-4. Results: Sixty patients met the inclusion criteria; however, 8 (13.3%) patients had an excessive gag reflex, and examination of the larynx was not possible. 15.4% of patients who underwent direct laryngoscopy had a Cormack and Lehane grade 3 or 4 view and were classified as difficult. Mirror laryngoscopy had a tendency toward statistical significance in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in these patients. Conclusions: This study is consistent with previous studies, which have demonstrated that no one individual traditional test has proven to be adequate in predicting difficult airways in the obese population. However, the new application of an old test - indirect mirror laryngoscopy - could be a useful additional test to predict difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients.",0,0
17315745,[TruViewEVO2 videolaryngoscope],"TruViewEVO2 videolaryngoscope (Truphatek, Israel) is a modified version of the Truphatek 1. We used this device in four patients with difficult airways. A 77-year-old obese woman, scheduled for nasal surgery, had short neck and small jaw. After induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade, laryngoscopy was attempted using a Macintosh blade, but the epiglottis, but not the glottis, was seen. A full view of the glottis was obtained when the TruView was used, and the trachea was easily intubated. In another two patients, in whom laryngoscopy with a Macintosh blade had failed, and in one patient with limited mouth opening, the TruView allowed us to see the glottis and to intubate the trachea without difficulty. Therefore, we believe that the TrueViewEVO2 videolaryngoscope is useful in patients with difficult airways.",0,0
3693166,Effects of lung inflation on nasal airway resistance in the anesthetized rat,"Nasal airway resistance was assessed in halothane-anesthetized rats by measuring the transnasal pressure at constant airflow through both nasal cavities. Low inflation pressures (2.5-5 cmH2O) decreased nasal airway resistance, whereas higher inflation pressures (10-20 cmH2O) caused a biphasic response: an initial increase in resistance followed by a decrease in resistance. The nasal responses to all levels of inflation were completely abolished by hexamethonium, guanethidine, or bretylium pretreatment or cervical sympathectomy and greatly lessened by cervical vagotomy or phenoxybenzamine pretreatment. Atropine and propranolol pretreatments had no effect on the responses. These findings indicate that the nasal airway resistance is related to the level of inflation through pulmonary reflexes with afferents along the vagi and efferents via the alpha-adrenergic nervous system.",0,0
24002788,Comparison of video laryngoscopy to direct laryngoscopy for intubation of patients with difficult airway characteristics in the emergency department,"The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of video laryngoscopy (VL) to direct laryngoscopy (DL) on the first pass intubation success of patients with difficult airway characteristics (DACs) in the emergency department (ED). Over a 6-year period, between July 1 2007 and June 30 2013, all intubations performed in an academic ED were recorded in a continuous quality improvement (CQI) database by the operators. The CQI form included information such as patient demographics, operator level of training, device(s) used, number of attempts and outcome of each attempt. In addition, operators performed a difficult airway assessment and noted the presence or absence of the following difficult airway characteristics (DACs): airway edema, cervical immobility, facial/neck trauma, large tongue, obesity, short neck, small mandible, and blood or vomit in the airway. Patients <18 years of age and those not intubated by an emergency physician (EP) were excluded from the analysis. Multivariate regression models were developed to determine the effect of device type (VL or DL) on first pass intubation success as the number of DACs increased. A total of 2,423 intubations were included in this study. First pass success by the number of DACs was as follows in the VL and DL groups, respectively: no DACs [90.8 % (95 % CI 87.5-93.4) vs. 82.0 % (95 % CI 78.0-85.5)]; one DAC [85.1 % (95 % CI 81.2-88.5 %) vs. 69.4 % (95 % CI 63.9-74.5 %)]; two DACs [(80.5 % (95 % CI 74.7-85.6 %) vs. 65.8 % (95 % CI 57.6-73.3 %)]; three or more DACs [68.9 % (95 % CI 63.8-73.7 %) vs. 54.1 % (95 % CI 46.3-61.8 %)]. After adjusting for potential confounders, VL was associated with higher odds of first pass success for patients with no DACs (aOR 2.0, 95 % CI 1.2-3.3), one DAC (aOR 3.2, 95 % CI 1.9-5.6), two DACs (aOR 2.3, 95 % CI 1.1-4.9), and three or more DACs (aOR 2.9, 95 % CI 1.5-5.5). In patients with DACs, VL was associated with a higher first pass success than DL. VL is recommended as the primary intubating device for patients with predicted difficult airways in the ED.",0,0
12486576,[Mobility of unstable fractures of the odontoid during helmet removal. A biomechanical study],"In severe motorcyclist accidents unstable injuries of the cervical spine can usually not be excluded before an X-ray has been taken in the hospital. Despite this the helmet has to be taken off at the place of the accident in order to provide adequate treatment and airway management of the injured driver. There are no data in the current literature showing what happens to unstable lesions of the cervical spine during helmet removal. An experimental unstable lesion of the cervical spine was created by an osteotomy of the odontoid in 10 fresh frozen cadavers with intact soft tissues. All motions occurring in the segments C1-2 and C2-3 during helmet removal were recorded by fluoroscopy. The average motion in the unstable segment C1-2 was 23.7 degrees during a full range of extension-flexion movement of the cervical spine without any signs of dislocation of the segment. After application of the helmet there was one case of dislocation of C1-2 in neutral supine position already, and two further cases of dislocations during helmet removal. The average motion of C1-2 recorded during helmet removal was 19.0 degrees (2-25 degrees ), median 18.0 degrees. In order to avoid fracture dislocations and motion in the unstable upper cervical spine the helmet should better be cut in pieces at the place of the accident. There is a need for discussions with helmet producers to develop a new generation of helmets that can be removed easily without manipulating the head.",0,0
25485099,Predictive factors for difficult mask ventilation in the obese surgical population,"Background Difficult Mask Ventilation (DMV), is a situation in which it is impossible for an unassisted anesthesiologist to maintain oxygen saturation >90% using 100% oxygen and positive pressure ventilation to prevent or reverse signs of inadequate ventilation during mask ventilation. The incidence varies from 0.08 - 15%. Patient-related anatomical features are by far the most significant cause. We analyzed data from an obese surgical population (BMI> 30 kg/m (2)) to identify specific risk and predictive factors for DMV. Methods Five hundred and fifty seven obese patients were identified from a database of 1399 cases associated with preoperative airway examinations where mask ventilation was attempted. Assessment of mask ventilation in this group was stratified by a severity score (0-3), and a step-wise selection method was used to identify independent predictors. The area under the curve of the receiver-operating-characteristic was then used to evaluate the model's predictive value. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were also calculated. Results DMV was observed in 80/557 (14%) patients. Three independent predictive factors for DMV in obese patients were identified: age 49 years, short neck, and neck circumference 43 cm. In the current study th sensitivity for one factor is 0.90 with a specificity 0.35. However, the specificity increased to 0.80 with inclusion of more than one factor. Conclusion According to the current investigation, the three predictive factors are strongly associated with DMV in obese patients. Each independent risk factor alone provides a good screening for DMV and two factors substantially improve specificity. Based on our analysis, we speculate that the absence of at least 2 of the factors we identified might have a significant negative predictive value and can reasonably exclude DMV, with a negative likelihood ratio 0.81.",1,1
25024468,Tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine immobilization: A comparison of McGrath(®) video laryngoscope and Truview EVO2(®) laryngoscope,"Background and aims: Literature suggests that glottic view is better when using McGrath(®) Video laryngoscope and Truview(®) in comparison with McIntosh blade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of McGrath Video laryngoscope in comparison with Truview laryngoscope for tracheal intubation in patients with simulated cervical spine injury using manual in-line stabilisation. Methods: This prospective randomised study was undertaken in operation theatre of a tertiary referral centre after approval from the Institutional Review Board. A total of 100 consenting patients presenting for elective surgery requiring tracheal intubation were randomly assigned to undergo intubation using McGrath(®) Video laryngoscope (n = 50) or Truview(®) (n = 50) laryngoscope. In all patients, we applied manual-in-line stabilisation of the cervical spine throughout the airway management. Statistical testing was conducted with the statistical package for the social science system version SPSS 17.0. Demographic data, airway assessment and haemodynamics were compared using the Chi-square test. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The time to successful intubation was less with McGrath video laryngoscope when compared to Truview (30.02 s vs. 38.72 s). However, there was no significant difference between laryngoscopic views obtained in both groups. The number of second intubation attempts required and incidence of complications were negligible with both devices. Success rate of intubation with both devices was 100%. Intubation with McGrath Video laryngoscope caused lesser alterations in haemodynamics. Conclusions: Both laryngoscopes are reliable in case of simulated cervical spine injury using manual-in-line stabilisation with 100% success rate and good glottic view.",0,0
9632969,Difficult tracheal intubation--analysis and management in 37 cases,"Aim: To analyse the anatomical features of difficult airways encountered during general anaesthesia and study how difficult intubation was circumvented during anaesthesia in our local population. Method: Difficult intubation was defined as failure to visualise the larynx during laryngoscopy after neck flexion and external cricoid pressure was applied. All cases of difficult intubation collected over 1 1/2 years during general anaesthesia were recorded prospectively and analysed. Results: Thirty-seven cases of difficult intubation were identified among 5,379 cases of general anaesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation. 40.5% of the cases were not expected to be difficult pre-operatively. 5.4% of the cases were Lehane II, 91.9% Lehane III and 2.7% Lehane IV. The anatomical features encountered included receding chin, limited mouth opening, limited neck extension, abnormal dentition, short thyromental distance, large tongue, supraglottic mass and floppy epiglottis. Gum elastic bougie was commonly used to overcome the intubation difficulties. Laryngeal mask, blind nasal tracheal intubation, fiberoptic bronchoscopic intubation and sometimes an alternative anaesthetic technique, such as regional anaesthesia, were resorted to. Conclusion: Assessment of multiple anatomical features would improve prediction of difficult intubation. Assessment of receding chin, neck extension, mouth opening, teeth, tongue size, thyromental distance might pick up 81% of difficult airways. Unexpected problems with epiglottis and glottic inlet are the potential sources of danger that are difficult to predict pre-operatively.",0,0
11180679,Compression of the trachea by the innominate artery in a 2-month-old child,"SUMMARY. We utilized improved methods for assessing airway structure and function to define the clinical significance of the innominate artery syndrome. Both infant pulmonary function tests (IPFT) and noninvasive controlled ventilation computed tomography (CVCT) were used, along with traditional diagnostic techniques in a 2-month-old child with compression of the trachea by the innominate artery. These tests provided objective documentation of functional impairment before surgery and improvement postoperatively. These tests should aid in the understanding of this controversial syndrome and help to further define treatment options.",0,0
11421837,Comparison of two video-assisted techniques for the difficult intubation,"Background: Two recently developed video-optical intubation devices, the video-optical intubation stylet (VOIS) and the angled video intubation laryngoscope (AVIL) were compared for intubation times and success rate in a simulated difficult tracheal intubation setting. Methods: Thirty anaesthetists were asked to perform 5 intubation attempts with both techniques. Intubation times were recorded and the subjective degree of difficulty and preference for each technique were requested. Results: Intubation time with the VOIS was shorter (17.4+/-6.8 s) than with the AVIL (22.8+/-13.4 s; P=0.0001). Four of the 150 intubation attempts with the AVIL were scored as unsuccessful, due to prolonged intubation time (>60 s). The estimated degree of difficulty was not significantly different. Conclusion: In conclusion, both video-assisted intubation devices, the video-optical intubation stylet and the angled video intubation laryngoscope, can be considered to be simple and effective tools which facilitate tracheal intubation and which require only brief instruction and training.",0,0

20191780,Patient- and operator-related factors associated with successful Glidescope intubations: a prospective observational study in 742 patients,"The Glidescope Video Laryngoscope (Glidescope, Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, U.S.A.) is a relatively new intubating device. It has been proposed to be useful for securing both routine airways and those where direct laryngoscopy may be difficult. In this prospective observational study, data for 742 intubations using the Glidescope were collected to investigate whether four factors are associated with successful tracheal intubation at first attempt using the Glidescope: previous Glidescope experience, previous direct laryngoscopy experience, level of anaesthesia training and clinical airway assessment. The likelihood of successful tracheal intubation at first attempt using the Glidescope increased with increasing previous Glidescope experience. Similarly, success was more likely in airways that were assessed as normal compared with those where direct laryngoscopies were either predicted or known to be difficult. Subgroup analysis indicated 83% first attempt success by 'experienced' Glidescope users in patients with documented difficult direct laryngoscopies. This supports its use as an adjunct device for management of airways where direct laryngoscopies prove difficult. With regard to the level of anaesthesia training, only medical students were more likely to fail with the Glidescope. Success was not associated with previous experience in direct laryngoscopy. The lack of association with direct laryngoscopy experience and level of anaesthesia training (beyond student level) suggests that expertise with traditional airway tools is not necessary to become proficient with the Glidescope.",0,0
17360113,Separation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from automobile shredder residue (ASR) by froth flotation with ozonation,"The purpose of this study is to develop froth flotation to separate polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from automobile shredder residue (ASR) plastic mixtures of variable composition. Some polymers in ASR polymer mixtures have similar density and hydrophobicity with PVC and thus selective flotation of PVC from ASR polymer mixtures cannot be achieved. The present study focused on the surface modification of PVC with ozonation, and then the modified PVC can be separated from other polymers by the following froth flotation. The results of this study indicate that the selective recovery of PVC from real ASR polyethylene tetra pethelate (PET), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polybutyl methacralate (PBMA), ethyl acrylate (EA), polycarbonate (PC) and rubber mixtures can be accomplished in a three-step process involving a gravity separation, ozonation and froth flotation. The rubber was removed from other heavy ASR (PVC, PET, PMMA, PBMA, EA and PC) polymers by froth flotation without mixing. It was found that ozonation process produced the desired difference in contact angle required (from 89.5 to 73.0 degrees ) for separation of PVC from other heavy ASR polymers, whereas the contact angles of other polymers was slightly decreased. The most of the load ASR, i.e. about 72.4% is floated away and 27.6% was settled down. The highest component 96.7% of PVC was recovered in the settled fraction. As a result of this research effort, the surface modification of PVC with ozonation can be efficiently useful to separate the PVC from other similar density ASR mixed polymers.",0,0
24017969,Evaluation of tracheal intubation: A retrospective study of skill acquisition by medical students in the operating theater,"Background/purpose: Tracheal intubation is a critical life-saving invasive procedure. Medical students generally obtain the skill of performing tracheal intubation in the operating theater during their anesthesiology rotation. In this study, we sought to characterize medical students' skill acquisition of tracheal intubation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the logbooks of 94 medical students who had completed a 3-4 week rotation in our department between January 2011 and June 2012. Results: Ninety-four students performed 934 tracheal intubations. The success rate of intubation was 76.7%. After adjustment for age, body mass index, Mallampati class and grade, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores, and surgical category, the odds ratio of successful tracheal intubation improved with cumulative practice [odds ratio (OR) = 1.05 for each additional intubation performed; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.09]. By contrast, the success rate decreased significantly with increasing scores of Mallampati class (OR = 0.32 for each increase in class; 95% CI 0.23-0.24) and grade (OR = 0.57 for each increase in grade; 95% CI 0.39-0.84). The main reason for intubation failure (57%) was poor visualization of vocal cords, due to suboptimal placement of the position of the laryngoscope. The satisfaction and confidence of students regarding the ability of performing tracheal intubation increased with each additional procedure, but decreased significantly after multiple unsuccessful attempts and the occurrence of any complication. Conclusion: Medical students acquired the ability of tracheal intubation and overcame major challenges through cumulative clinical practice of the procedure.",0,0
18075206,Predisposing factors of sleep-disordered breathing in Japanese male workers,"The aim of this study was to elucidate the usable predisposing factors of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the workplace. A total of 353 male workers who complained of SDB related symptoms such as witnessed snoring, recurrent awakening from sleep, urination during the night, morning headache, and excessive daytime sleepiness were included in the analysis. We examined hyoid-mental distance (HMD), modified Mallampati score (MMS), and the narrowness of the pharynx with tonsillar hypertrophy as the predisposing physical findings of SDB. We used the number of 3% or more oxygen desaturation events per hour (ODI3) as the indicator of SDB. The mean values (S.D.) of all subjects were 44.3 (8.9) yr (19-66 yr) of age, and 25.9 (3.8) Kg/m(2) body mass index (BMI). A significant difference in ODI3 was found between the HMD classes, and also between the subjects with and without tonsillar hypertrophy. Mean ODI3 adjusted for age, BMI, and alcohol consumption on the day of monitoring was high in the group of short HMD and the group of tonsillar hypertrophy (+). For MMS, though ODI3 did not appear to be significantly different, mean ODI3 was high in the MMS-IV. In conclusion, short HMD and tonsillar hypertrophy are the important findings predicting SDB identified by pulse oximetry. These findings would be beneficial in the workplace for selection of subjects who should be encouraged to undergo pulse oximetry for detection of SDB.",0,0

17582247,Evaluation of the Cobra perilaryngeal airway (CPLA) as an airway conduit,"Background and objective: The effectiveness of the Cobra perilaryngeal airway as a routine airway device and as a conduit for tracheal intubation has not been prospectively studied to date. This study aimed to evaluate the Cobra perilaryngeal airway for its potential role in an emergency airway rescue, by analysing its use as a bridge to blind or fibre-optic-guided intubation. Methods: In 49 patients, the procedure was carried out as follows: fibre-optic view through the Cobra perilaryngeal airway was assessed after the insertion of the Cobra perilaryngeal airway, then blind intubation through the Cobra perilaryngeal airway was attempted. After evaluating the success of blind intubation, fibre-optic-guided intubation was performed through the Cobra perilaryngeal airway. The endotracheal tube was removed after evaluating the success of fibre-optic-guided intubation, and then conventional laryngoscopy was carried out to evaluate the Cormack & Lehane grade and airway trauma. Results: In all, 95.9% (47/49) of patients had adequate ventilation using the Cobra perilaryngeal airway; the success rates for the blind and fibre-optic-guided intubation were 36.2% and 83.0%, respectively. The patients were divided into two groups according to the fibre-optic view. Group 1 included patients with an obstructed view by an anterior grill of the Cobra perilaryngeal airway head, and a view of the anterior epiglottis (downfolded epiglottis) with or without a visible larynx (16/47, 34.0%). Group 2 included the remaining patients (31/47, 66.0%). The success rates of the blind and fibre-optic intubations were different between the two groups (blind intubation: 12.5% vs. 48.4%, fibre-optic intubation: 62.5% vs. 93.6%, P 0.05). 42.6% of patients had blood staining after removing the device and complications such as trauma and oedema were confirmed under direct laryngoscopy. Conclusion: This study suggests that the Cobra perilaryngeal airway could be a useful airway device as a vehicle for fibre-optic-guided intubation; however, it needs caution against airway trauma.",0,0
21033453,[Evaluation of a protocol for predicting difficult airway in routine practice: interobserver agreement],"Objectives: To evaluate a protocol for routine assessment of potential risk factors for difficult airway intubation in an anesthesia department, by measuring interobserver agreement and the behavior of the factors in a predictive model. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study group of 320 consecutive patients undergoing major surgery requiring orotracheal intubation was assessed for possible difficult airway. We calculated interrater agreement for recording of the Mallampati score, thyromental distance less than 6 cm, thick neck, kyphosis, small mouth, macroglossia, and dental prosthesis during the preanesthesia examination (by an anesthetist) and on the day of the operation (by an anesthetist and a resident). We constructed a model to predict difficult intubation (requiring 3 or more attempts). Results: The kappa indices of agreement between the anesthetists at the preoperative examination and in the operating room or the resident were all less than 0.6. Factors like thyromental distance, small mouth, and kyphosis had kappa indices less than 0.21. The kappa index between the resident and the anesthetist in the operating room was over 0.55. The only factor that had a different level of agreement was the presence or not of a dental prosthesis. None of the studied individual factors, nor these factors in association with the Mallampati score, achieved significance in a bivariate regression model to predict difficult intubation. Conclusions: There is poor interobserver agreement on factors for predicting difficult airway in comparisons between preoperative and operating room assessment by an anesthetist or a resident. The individual predictive factors and their association with the Mallampati score did not prove useful for predicting difficult intubation.",0,0
12903521,[The summarization of clinical experience of difficult tracheal intubation],"Objective: To summarize our experiences and lessons of difficult tracheal intubation for clinical anesthesia reference. Methods: We had done a retrospective analysis of clinical data on difficult tracheal intubation in 2,825 patients undergoing elective plastic surgery with anesthesia. The main causes of difficult tracheal intubation were the limitations of neck extension (n = 1,169), mouth opening (n = 889), both neck extension and mouth opening (n = 698), and micromaxillary deformity (n = 69). By the Cormack's classification, all the patients had the laryngeal exposure of grade II or more. The tracheal intubations were done under neuroleptanalgesia combined with topical spray of local anesthetic in 439 patients, intravenous anesthesia of sedative drugs and nondepolarizing relaxants of subnormal doses in 629 subjects, and total intravenous or inhaled anesthesia in 1,757 cases, respectively. Results: The difficult tracheal intubations were completed using blind nasal intubations in 142 patients, blind oral intubations with direct laryngoscope in 2,377 patients, oral intubations with fiberoptic stylet rigid laryngoscope in 186 patients, and oral or nasal intubations with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope in 72 patients. The incidence of successful intubation was 99.7%. The common complication of intubation was airway trauma and its incidence was 19.3% in all the patients. Anesthetic techniques could affect significantly the intubation time and the incidences of complications in the patients with difficult intubation. Conclusions: By the improvement of anesthetic methods and common intubation techniques, the intubation time and the incidence of complications in the patients with difficult intubations were reduced.",0,0
20378726,Advances in diagnostic bronchoscopy,"Diagnostic bronchoscopy has undergone two major paradigm shifts in the last 40 years. First, the advent of flexible bronchoscopy gave chest physicians improved access to the tracheobronchial tree with a rapid learning curve and greater patient comfort compared with rigid bronchoscopy. The second paradigm shift has evolved over the last 5 years with the proliferation of new technologies that have significantly enhanced the diagnostic capabilities of flexible bronchoscopy compared with traditional methods. At the forefront of these new technologies is endobronchial ultrasound. In its various forms, endobronchial ultrasound has improved diagnostic yield for pulmonary masses, nodules, intrathoracic adenopathy, and disease extent, thereby reducing the need for more invasive surgical interventions. Various navigational bronchoscopy systems have become available to increase flexible bronchoscope access to small peripheral pulmonary lesions. Furthermore, various modalities of airway assessment, including optical microscopic imaging technologies, may play significant roles in the diagnosis of a variety of pulmonary diseases in the future. Finally, the combination of new diagnostic bronchoscopy technologies and novel approaches in molecular analysis and biomarker assessment hold promise for enhanced diagnosis and personalized management of many pulmonary disorders. In this review, we provide a contemporary review of diagnostic bronchoscopy developments over the past decade.",0,0
10447910,Anaesthetic management of two paediatric patients with Hecht-Beals syndrome,"We undertook the anaesthetic management of two children with Hecht-Beals syndrome for orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia. Both patients had arachnodactyly, kyphoscoliosis, and multiple congenital joint contractures, but limited mandible excursion was not obvious preoperatively in either, although mental retardation made it difficult for them to cooperate with mouth examination. They had no apparent difficulties with their mouths in daily activities. The anaesthesia records of one patient showed that intubation had been difficult in an earlier procedure. The other patient also had a history of difficult intubation, with slight tearing of the corners of her mouth during an intubation procedure. During slow induction of general anaesthesia with sevoflurane, face mask ventilation was easily performed. We attempted to visualize the larynx under anaesthesia with muscle relaxation, but we were unsuccessful because of the limited mouth opening. After several trials, blind oral intubations were fortunately successful in both patients. There were no postoperative problems with the airway.",0,0
26521200,Parapharyngeal abscess following use of a laryngeal mask airway during open revision septorhinoplasty,"Introduction: A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an established safe tool to support the airway during surgery under general anesthetic. It is commonly used both in North America and abroad. Complications with this device are rare. Presentation of case: A 50-year old female developed a parapharyngeal neck abscess following an uneventful septorhinoplasty during use of an LMA Classic. The patient had symptoms of pain and difficulty swallowing. CT revealed extensive soft tissue edema and swelling in the right and posterior neck involving the right parapharyngeal space, right parotid space, minimal involvement of the right submandibular space, and extending across the retropharyngeal space. The abscess was incised and drained with an open approach, combined with laryngoscopy to evaluate the site of the infection at the right pyriform fossa. The patient fully recovered following discharge. Discussion: Despite the rare incidence of LMA injuries, early recognition of parapharyngeal neck abscesses can initiate early treatment and prevention of spread to retropharyngeal space where airway obstruction and emergent complications may occur. Conclusion: Laryngeal mask airways have a high rate of success and low rate of complications. In this reported case, pressure necrosis from over-inflation of the LMA is thought to have perforated the right pyriform fossa. The perforation created a communication into the parapharyngeal space causing infection. We report this case to highlight the importance of identifying possible complications associated with a routine method of airway management during shared airway surgeries.",0,0
25736546,Friedman tongue position: age distribution and relationship to sleep-disordered breathing,"Purpose: Friedman tongue position (FTP) may play an important role in the evaluation of children with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), but there are no previous data on FTP distribution by age. The objective of the current study was to determine the distribution of FTP by age and examine the relationship between FTP and snoring in children. Methods: Prospective cross-sectional study of 199 children (mean age, 6.8 years; 59% male) had tongue position assessed by FTP as part of their clinical examination of the oral cavity during routine ENT visits at a tertiary care children's hospital. The FTP and snoring frequency of participants was examined across the entire age range as well as by comparing those older (middle childhood and above) and younger than 5 years of age. Results: Tongue position did not correlate with age or snoring frequency. The proportion of children with FTP III/IV was not significantly different in children younger than five years of age compared to older than five. Habitual snoring was not associated with having a higher FTP. Among children who snored <3 times per week, those who had previously undergone tonsillectomy did have higher FTP compared to those who had not (p=0.007). BMI-%-for-age was significantly correlated with FTP (p=0.003). The percent of children having FTP class III/IV differed significantly between ethnicities (22% of whites, 26% of others, 45% of hispanics, 53% of African-Americans; p=0.011). Inter-rater reliability among pediatric otolaryngologist was excellent (kappa=0.93, p<0.001). Conclusions: There does not appear to be an association between FTP with age or snoring frequency in children. The excellent inter-rater reliability for FTP among pediatric ENT providers suggests the null findings are not due to rater bias. These findings may serve as an important reference for those studying the role of tongue position in pediatric SRBD and complement previous studies examining FTP among children with known OSA or snoring.",0,0
7872557,[Diprivan: sedation for difficult intubation],"No study has compared anaesthetic protocols appropriate for the sedation for fiberoptic tracheal intubation. Extrapolation of results of randomised studies comparing sedation techniques for diagnostic bronchoscopy under local anaesthesia enables the following conclusions: 1. Possible hypnotic agents for this procedure are benzodiazepines, barbiturates and propofol. Fentanyl improves the conditions for bronchoscopy. 2. Sedation using propofol is a well established technique. The induction dose, given as a bolus injection is 1 mg.kg-1, followed by continuous maintenance infusion of 1 mg.kg.h-1. 3. Irrespective of the sedation protocol used, there is always respiratory depression which justifies the need for preoxygenation, continuous oxygenation and Spo2 monitoring. Reversal of benzodiazepine and opioid effects may temporarily protect against respiratory depression.",0,0
25625059,Comparison of i-gel™ and laryngeal mask airway in anesthetized paralyzed patients,"Background: The i-gel™ is a new device introduced recently. It differs from other supraglottic airway devices. It has a non-inflatable, gel-made cuff. Previously used devices, have some disadvantages which are claimed to be absent in i-gel™. In this study we aimed to compare the performance of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA)-Classic™ and i-gel™ during anesthesia in paralyzed patients. Materials and methods: A total of 64 anaesthetized patients with paralysis were enrolled in a single-blind, randomized control trial to be intubated with one of the devices. We compared the device insertion parameters, some ventilatory parameters, and adverse effects after device insertion. Results: Vital signs were not significantly different between groups. Regarding duration of insertion attempts, the difference between groups was significant (P < 0.05); while the number of insertion attempts was insignificant (P = 0.265). There was no significant difference between both groups regarding postoperative complications (cough, sore throat, and blood on the cuff) (P > 0.05). Airway leak was assessed in both groups and data showed no significant difference (P = 0.662). Additionally, end-tidal CO2 change regarding the baseline value was significantly different after 10 and 15 min of anesthesia (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Successful insertion time was shorter significantly for i-gel™. As i-gel™ has easy application, it is advantageous to be used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation by non-anesthetists in which time is very important. We concluded that i-gel™ can be an alternative to LMA-Classic™ for controlled ventilation during anesthesia as it is easier to be placed.",0,0
15863443,Airway hyperresponsiveness induced by cationic proteins in vivo: site of action,"Major basic protein and other native cationic proteins increase airway hyperresponsiveness when administered to the luminal surface of the airways in vitro. To determine whether the same applies in vivo, we assessed airway responsiveness in rats challenged with both aerosolized and intravenously infused methacholine. We partitioned total lung resistance into its airway and tissue components using the alveolar capsule technique. Neither poly-l-lysine nor major basic protein altered baseline mechanics or its dependence on positive end-expiratory pressures ranging from 1 to 13 cmH(2)O. When methacholine was administered to the lungs as an aerosol, both cationic proteins increased responsiveness as measured by airway resistance, tissue resistance, and tissue elastance. However, responsiveness of all three parameters was unchanged when the methacholine was infused. Together, these findings suggest that cationic proteins alter airway responsiveness in vivo by an effect that is apparently limited to the bronchial epithelium.",0,0
22435251,Snake scope camera assisted endotracheal intubation: a procedural skills training in cadaver to prepare preclinical students for their clerkships,"Objective: Preparing students to perform specific procedures on patients presents a challenge of student confidence in performing these tasks. This descriptive study determined the ability of the medical students to perform a basic clinical task after a short hands-on training workshop in cadavers. This basic procedural skills training was an attempt for developing conceptual understanding and increasing procedural skills in endotracheal intubation of the medical students. Material and method: The students were trained to perform two different endotracheal intubations, uncomplicated intubation, and a traumatic difficult airway scenario. The training session consisted of two methods of endotracheal intubation, oral intubations using direct laryngoscopy (DL) in two cadavers with uncomplicated airway and the Flexible Snake Scope camera (FSSC) assisted nasal intubation procedures in two cadavers simulated trauma victims with difficult airway. In the assessment session, the students performed one timed trial with each device. All four cadavers were changed but the scenarios were the same. The groups of the medical students were randomly assigned to perform the tasks in one of two cadavers of the two scenarios. Results: Thirty-two medical students participated in this training and assessment. The training session and the assessment lasted five hours and three hours respectively. No student was asked to perform the second trial. The average time for successful intubation with DL was 32.7 seconds (SD, 13.8 seconds) and for FSSC was 127.0 seconds (SD, 32.6 seconds). The intubation failure rate was 0% for the entire study. Conclusion: The medical students have the ability to accomplish a basic clinical task after a short hands-on training workshop.",0,0
18652108,Postoperative use of nasal intermittent positive pressure in a patient with spinal muscular atrophy type II,"We report the successful use of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the perioperative period of a 51 yr-old woman with a type II spinal muscular atrophy (SMA II). The patient was treated chronically with nocturnal NIPPV at home and scheduled for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) under general anesthesia. Some criteria of difficult intubation were present (forced mouth opening of 1.5 cm, short neck and thyromental distance of 5 cm). Nasal endotracheal fiberoptic intubation during spontaneous breathing under sedation with propofol was performed. The ERCP procedure was conducted without complications. At the end of the procedure, IPPV was maintained until recovery of respiratory function. After extubation, NIPPV was continued in the recovery room. The patient was discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit 4 hours after the procedure. Management of patients with SMA remains a challenge and clinicians must be aware that the use of NIPPV may be a useful and life-saving tool in the perioperative period for these patients.",0,0
27563608,Retrospective evaluation of airway management with blind awake intubation in temporomandibular joint ankylosis patients: A review of 48 cases,"Aim: The aim was to determine the morbidity or mortality associated with the blind awake intubation technique in temporomandibular ankylosis patients. Settings and design: A total of 48 cases with radiographically and clinically confirmed cases of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis were included in the study for evaluation of anesthetic management and its complications. Materials and methods: Airway assessment was done with standard proforma including Look externally, evaluate 3-3-2 rule, Mallampati classification, Obstruction, Neck mobility (LEMON) score assessment in all TMJ ankylosis patients. The intubation was carried out with the standard departmental anesthetic protocol in all the patients. The preoperative difficulty assessment and postoperative outcome were recorded. Results: Blind awake intubation was done in 92% of cases, 6% of cases were intubated by fiberoptic awake intubation, and 2% patient required surgical airway. Ninety-eight percent of the patients were cooperative during the awake intubation. The frequent complications encountered during the blind awake intubation were epistaxis and sore throat. Conclusion: In an anesthetic setup, where fiberoptic intubation is not available, blind awake intubation could be considered in the anesthetic management algorithm.",0,0
24964904,Preoperative clinical predictors of difficult laryngeal exposure for microlaryngoscopy: the Laryngoscore,"Objectives/hypothesis: To identify a clinical predictor score for difficult laryngeal exposure (DLE) during operative microlaryngoscopy. Study design: Prospective cohort study in two academic institutions. Methods: We evaluated 319 patients before microlaryngoscopy for benign and malignant glottic diseases by a standardized preoperative assessment protocol (Laryngoscore) that included 11 parameters: interincisors gap (IIG), thyro-mental distance, upper jaw dental status, trismus, mandibular prognathism, macroglossia, micrognathia, degree of neck flexion-extension, history of previous open-neck and/or radiotherapy, Mallampati's modified score, and body mass index (BMI). Each parameter was assessed to obtain a total score. Patients were divided into five classes according to the anterior commissure (AC) visualization: class 0, complete AC visualization with large-bore laryngoscopes in the Boyce-Jackson position; class I, as class 0 with external laryngeal counterpressure; class II, as class I in the flexion-flexion position; class III, as class II using small-bore laryngoscopes; and class IV, impossible AC visualization. Results: Class 0-I-II (good/acceptable laryngeal exposure) presented a median score < 6. This value was chosen as cutoff for distinguishing favorable versus difficult/impossible laryngeal exposures. When the Laryngoscore was < 6, good laryngeal exposure was observed in 94% of patients, whereas when ≥ 6, DLE was encountered in 40%. When considering a Laryngoscore of ≥ 9, 67% of patients had a DLE. At univariate analysis, IIG, upper jaw dental status, macroglossia, micrognathia, degree of neck flexion-extension, and BMI statistically impacted on DLE (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The Laryngoscore is a good predictor of DLE and assists in selecting the ideal candidates for operative microlaryngoscopy. Level of evidence: 2b.",0,0
9287899,Gastric rupture with tension pneumoperitoneum: a complication of difficult endotracheal intubation,"Gastric rupture is a rare complication of difficult airway management. In cases of vigorous mouth-to-mouth ventilation, bag-valve-mask ventilation, or esophageal intubation, gastric rupture and massive intraperitoneal free air may cause tension pneumoperitoneum. Hemodynamic instability necessitates immediate intervention, including needle decompression of the peritoneum followed by surgical exploration. We recently encountered two cases of gastric rupture with tension pneumoperitoneum that occurred after difficult endotracheal intubation. This report describes the presentation, treatment, and prevention of this entity.",0,0
24803755,Bedside prediction of airway length by measuring upper incisor manubrio-sternal joint length,"Background: Malpositioning of endotracheal tube may lead to serious complications like endobronchial intubation or accidental extubation. Using anatomical measurements for prediction of airway length would be more practical in resource constrained settings. Materials and methods: One hundred adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1 or 2, without any evidence of difficult airway, were randomly allocated to two cohorts - a model cohort of 70 (50 males) and test cohort of 30 (20 males) subjects. Height, the straight length from the upper incisor to manubrio-sternal joint in fully extended head position (IncManustL), the length from upper incisor to the carina in neutral head position (IncCarinaL), and degree of neck extension were measured in all subjects. Relationship between the two lengths in the model cohort was explored by Pearson's coefficient (r). Predictions were made for subjects in the test cohort and actual and predicted values assessed for agreement using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Good agreement was found between IncManustL and IncCarinaL for both male (r = 0.69) and female (r = 0.54) subjects. Multiple regression analysis suggested height to be another significant predictor, unlike age, weight, and neck extension. The gender-specific regression equations were used to predict IncCarinaL for the test cohort. ICC for absolute agreement between the actual and predicted values was 0.723 (95% CI 0.495-0.858). Conclusions: It is possible to predict airway length in adult Indian subjects by making two simple anatomical measurements, namely stature and incisor manubrio-sternal joint length.",0,0

1643688,Anaesthetic implications of temporomandibular joint disease,"The purpose of this article is to review the functional anatomy of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) mechanism in man, to discuss the various types of TMJ dysfunction and to suggest a plan for assessment, anaesthesia and airway management when reconstructive or unrelated surgery is required. Patients with restricted mouth opening, who require critical care treatment of severe upper airway obstruction or impending ventilatory failure are a special risk group. Regional anaesthesia or the use of a laryngeal airway should be considered. When tracheal intubation is essential and mouth opening is less than 25 mm, it is unlikely that the larynx will be visualized by direct laryngoscopy. Fibreoptic intubation is then indicated. All patients with severe TMJ dysfunction require assessment by an oral surgeon.",0,0
17142550,Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients during and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: an update,"The safe sedation of children for procedures requires a systematic approach that includes the following: no administration of sedating medication without the safety net of medical supervision; careful presedation evaluation for underlying medical or surgical conditions that would place the child at increased risk from sedating medications; appropriate fasting for elective procedures and a balance between depth of sedation and risk for those who are unable to fast because of the urgent nature of the procedure; a focused airway examination for large tonsils or anatomic airway abnormalities that might increase the potential for airway obstruction; a clear understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the medications used for sedation, as well as an appreciation for drug interactions; appropriate training and skills in airway management to allow rescue of the patient; age- and size-appropriate equipment for airway management and venous access; appropriate medications and reversal agents; sufficient numbers of people to carry out the procedure and monitor the patient; appropriate physiologic monitoring during and after the procedure; a properly equipped and staffed recovery area; recovery to presedation level of consciousness before discharge from medical supervision; and appropriate discharge instructions. This report was developed through a collaborative effort of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry to offer pediatric providers updated information and guidance in delivering safe sedation to children.",0,0
20950978,Accuracy of automatic airway morphometry in computed tomography-correlation of radiological-pathological findings,"Objectives: Airway morphology shows characteristic changes in different pathologies. This study assesses the accuracy of a current automatic airway assessment technique by correlating CT images of porcine airways to histological slices of the same localization. Materials and methods: Four isolated and ventilated porcine lungs were frozen in a liquid nitrogen bath and examined with a CT scanner (MDCT). This technique both preserved normal radiomorphological appearance and made it possible to slice the specimens for histological examination for subsequent correlation. The parameters wall thickness (WT), wall percentage (WP), and total diameter (TD) were assessed by computer-aided measurement of the MDCT images using an integral-based method (IBM) and by manually measuring the histological slices with an electronic caliper. Results: The radiological-pathological correlation could be performed for 16 localizations. Mean relative errors for WT, WP, and TD were 11%, 5.6%, and 8.5%, respectively. Correlation was very high with coefficients r of 0.951 for WT, 0.916 for WP, and 0.987 for TD. Conclusions: Our results are comparable to previously described errors in phantom correlations but are the first proof of ex vivo feasibility. Thus, by applying this freezing technique to MDCT data of diseased, explanted lungs and by combination with the IBM, further experiments can be performed to explore the effects of airway pathology on radiological morphology.",0,0
17014927,Pilot study to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography in confirming endotracheal tube placement,"Study objective: Visualization of the vocal cords and end-tidal capnography are the usual standards in confirming endotracheal tube placement. Vocal cord visualization is, however, not always possible, and capnography is not 100% reliable and requires ventilation of the lungs to confirm placement. The goal of this study is to determine the accuracy of ultrasonography for detecting endotracheal tube placement into the trachea and esophagus in real time. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Eligible patients were adults undergoing elective surgery requiring intubation. Exclusion criteria were a history of difficult intubation, abnormal airway anatomy, aspiration risk factors, and esophageal disease. Thirty-three patients were enrolled. After induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade, the anesthesiologist placed the endotracheal tube in the trachea and esophagus in random order with direct laryngoscopy. During the intubations, a high-frequency, linear transducer was placed transversely on the neck at the suprasternal notch. Two emergency physicians, blinded to the order and performance of the intubations, independently recorded the location of the endotracheal tube according to the real-time ultrasonographic image. A 2-by-2 table was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity of the emergency physicians' ability to detect placement of the endotracheal tube. Results: For each physician, the sensitivity for identifying the first intubation as tracheal was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77% to 100%) with a specificity of 100% (95% CI 82% to 100%). One endotracheal tube was unintentionally placed twice in the esophagus, but both tube placements were identified as esophageal by the emergency physicians. Conclusion: In this pilot study, 2 emergency physicians experienced in ultrasonography accurately detected placement of endotracheal tubes during intubation with ultrasonography in select patients in the controlled environment of the operating room. Future studies should examine the use of ultrasonography to visualize endotracheal tube placement in real time by emergency physicians with less ultrasonographic training; use of the technique in the emergency department on a wider range of patients, including patients with difficult airways; and assessment of the utility of ultrasonography in confirmation of endotracheal tube position in already intubated patients.",0,0
21437696,Otorhinolaryngological findings and hearing in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children in a developing country,"The otorhinolaryngological (ORL) manifestations of Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are common, but remain poorly characterized among children of Sub-Saharan Africa, where 90% of new pediatric infections occur. Our objective was to compare ORL findings and hearing in HIV-positive and -negative children of Luanda, Angola, using a comparative study of 78 outpatients from the HIV polyclinic and of 78 age- and sex-matched controls in a pediatric hospital with interview, general and ORL examination, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and at age >5 years pure tone open-air audiometry. ORL pathology emerged in 92% of HIV-positive and 78% (p = 0.02) of control children. HIV-associated ORL findings comprised dental caries (56 vs. 32%; p = 0.0009), cervical lymphadenopathy >1 cm (45 vs. 10%; p < 0.0001), facial skin lesions (32 vs. 5.1%; p < 0.0001), chronic suppurative otitis media (26 vs. 3.8%; p = 0.0002), dry tympanic membrane perforations (9 vs. 1%; p = 0.03), tonsils of Mallampati score 0-1 (87 vs. 64%; p = 0.0009), and bilateral hearing loss of >25 dB (13 vs. 1%; p = 0.009). Other HIV-associated characteristics included ear pain (44 vs. 27%; p = 0.006), earlier otorrhea episodes (34 vs. 17%; p = 0.004), tuberculosis (29 vs. 2.6%; p < 0.0001), and pneumonia (22 vs. 2.6%; p = 0.0003). ORL pathology appeared usual in both HIV-positive and -negative children. However, the overall high frequency and severity of the findings among the HIV-positive children require regular inclusion of the ORL area in these children's clinical evaluation.",0,0
25212815,Tracheal intubation with the Bonfils fiberscope in the difficult pediatric airway: a comparison with fiberoptic intubation,"Background: Fiberoptic intubation (FOI) is the gold standard for the tracheal intubation in adults with a difficult airway. However, this technique is more difficult in the narrow pediatric airway and the evaluation of alternative devices in children remains desirable. The Bonfils fiberscope (BF) is well described for the difficult airway, but no clinical data assessing its use in the difficult pediatric airway are available. Methods: A controlled clinical study was conducted comparing BF and FOI in children and infants requiring tracheal intubation with a suspected difficult airway or who demonstrated a difficult airway which was unanticipated. Time to successful intubation, quality of imaging and ease of the intubation procedure were determined. Results: A total of 26 patients (46% infants) were studied, and all successfully intubated at the first attempt using either the BF or FOI. Mouth opening was restricted in 38% of patients. Time required for intubation was shorter with the BF (52 ± 22 s) compared with the FOI (83 ± 24 s, P = 0.008). The image quality (excellent in 73% vs. 45%, P = 0.129) and the ease of the procedure (excellent in 67% vs. 18%, P = 0.015) were considered better with BF than with FOI. Conclusion: Although both the BF and FOI are suitable devices for the intubation of infants and children with difficult airways, the BF may allow faster tracheal intubation with a better image quality and ease of use.",0,0
20829701,Comparison of TruView EVO2 with Miller laryngoscope in paediatric patients,"Background: Except for neonates and specific malformations in children, management of the paediatric airway is not a major problem for the anaesthetist. Miller laryngoscope was traditionally used for paediatric intubation. The TruView EVO2 system is a recently introduced device with a unique blade that provides a wide and magnified laryngeal view. Objective: To assess the value of the TruView EVO2 laryngoscope with that of Miller laryngoscope in paediatric patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Measurements and results: Fifty 2-8-year paediatric patients presenting for surgery requiring tracheal intubation were randomly assigned to undergo intubation using a Miller (Group M, n = 25) and TruView EVO2 laryngoscope (Group T, n = 25). Preoperative airway evaluation was performed by using the Mallampati scores. The Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), the duration of the tracheal intubation procedure, the rate of successful placement of the endotracheal tube in the trachea, the view of the glottis according to the Cormack and Lehane grading criteria, number of intubation attempts, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) before and after intubation, lowest peripheric oxygen saturation during intubation attempts and all complications (minor laseration, dental or other airway trauma) were all recorded. Results: Preoperative Mallampati scores and the IDS scores were similar between the Miller and TruView EVO2 laryngoscope. The average time for laryngoscopy was 6.36 ± 0.99 s in group M and 13.8 ± 7.99 s in group T (P < 0.001). The TruView EVO2 laryngoscope improved the Cormack and Lehane glottic view compared with the Miller laryngoscope. The HR change (difference before and after) in group M was significantly lower than that in group T (P < 0.001). However, the MAP change was similar between groups. The lowest peripheric oxygen saturation during intubation attempts was different between groups, 99.4 ± 0.57% in group M and 97.6 ± 2.41% in group T (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that when compared with the Miller laryngoscope, the TruView EVO2 laryngoscope appears to improve the view of the larynx but requires a longer time for tracheal intubation. The IDS scores were similar; thus, the TruView EVO2 laryngoscope can be a good alternative to traditionally used Miller laryngoscope.",0,0
12859474,To shape or not to shape...simulated bougie-assisted difficult intubation in a manikin,"Thirty anaesthetists attempted to place a derived 'optimal' curve bougie or a straight bougie in the trachea of a manikin, in a randomised cross-over study. A Grade 3 Cormack and Lehane laryngoscopic view was simulated. The anaesthetists were blinded to success (tracheal placement) or failure (oesophageal placement). The success rates with the curved and straight bougies were 83 and 7%, respectively, giving a difference (95% confidence interval) of 77% (54-87%) between the two bougies (p < 0.0001). On a separate occasion, under identical laboratory conditions, 30 anaesthetists attempted to place a straight coudé (angled)-tipped bougie or a straight straight-tipped bougie in the trachea of a manikin. The success rates with the coudé- and straight-tipped bougies were 43 and 0%, respectively, giving a difference (95% confidence interval) of 43% (21-61%) between the two bougies (p < 0.001). These results suggest that bougies used to facilitate difficult intubation should be curved and have a coudé tip.",0,0
15768815,Pharyngometric correlations with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Objective: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and pharyngometric dimensions as clinical predictors of OSAS. Material and methods: Pharyngometry included tonsil size, the breadth of the uvula (UB), the distance between the uvula and the posterior pharyngeal wall and open mouth standardized photographic measurement of the dimension of the free oropharynx (FOP). We also assessed modified Mallampati grade (MMP). In addition, clinical data on body weight, height, nasal obstruction and cardiovascular disease were included in our analysis. Results: A total of 96 consecutive patients of both sexes with sleep disorders were investigated with somnography. Of these, 35 were considered to have OSAS, with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > or = 10. Body mass index (BMI), FOP, UB, the use of cardiovascular medication and hypertension were significantly related to AHI, and tonsil size showed borderline significance. Regression models were used to determine an OSAS index using the parameters BMI and FOP. The index had a positive predictive value of 82% and a negative predictive value of 77%. Conclusions: We showed that a photographic assessment of pharyngeal dimensions was significantly associated with OSAS. We also confirmed previous findings of associations between OSAS, BMI and cardiovascular morbidity.",0,0
21472485,"Difficult and failed intubation: Incident rates and maternal, obstetrical, and anesthetic predictors","Background: Difficult and failed tracheal intubation may be more common in the obstetrical population. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of difficult and failed tracheal intubation in a Canadian tertiary care obstetric hospital and to identify predictors. Methods: Maternal, perinatal, and anesthetic information on all pregnant women or recently pregnant (up to three days postpartum) women undergoing general anesthesia (GA) from 1984 to 2003 at the Izaac Walton Killam Health Centre (IWK) was abstracted from the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database, and the information was augmented by chart review. The incidence and predictors of difficult and failed tracheal intubation were determined. Analyses using logistic regression were performed for the complete GA cohort and for the subgroup that had Cesarean delivery under GA. Results: There were 102,587 deliveries of ≥20 weeks gestation in the study population, with 3,107 GAs identified, 2,986 records reviewed, and 2,633 GAs (88%) retained in the complete cohort. Difficult tracheal intubation was encountered in 123 of 2,633 (4.7%) women in the complete cohort and 60 of 1,052 (5.7%) women in the Cesarean delivery subgroup. Only two failed tracheal intubations were identified (0.08%) in the complete cohort, and both occurred during GAs for postpartum tubal ligation. The combined rate of difficult/failed tracheal intubation remained stable over the 20 years reviewed despite decreasing GA rates. Amongst the complete cohort, maternal age ≥35 yr, weight at delivery 90 to 99 kg, and absence of labour predicted increased risks; while weight at delivery 90 to 99 kg and absence of labour amongst the Cesarean delivery subgroup predicted difficult/failed tracheal intubation. Conclusion: Previously accepted risk factors, such as labour, pre-existing medical conditions and obstetrical disorders, did not predict an increased risk of difficult tracheal intubation, while maternal age ≥35 yr, weight 90 to 99 kg, and absence of active labour were found to predict increased risk.",0,0
11432182,Anesthetic considerations for orthognathic surgery with evaluation of difficult intubation and technique for hypotensive anesthesia,"Orthognathic surgery is carried out to improve facial appearance and/or to improve malocclusion. Usually, patients are young and healthy. However, they may have airway problems. Reinforced silicone low-pressure, high-volume endotracheal tubes and p-xylometazoline (Otrivin) for nasal vasoconstriction reduces problems due to the endotracheal tubes. A head-up position with ventilator and monitoring equipment at the foot end helps the surgeons as well as the surgery. Surgeons may be the cause of endotracheal tube problems. Bleeding is a major problem that may be encountered and is reduced by induced hypotension. During osteotomies, severe bradycardia may occur and may even lead to cardiac arrest. In the early postoperative period, bleeding may be a problem. Later ulceration at the tip of the nose and on the buttocks may be seen if preventive measures are not carried out.",0,0

21676271,Role of anesthesiology curriculum in improving bag-mask ventilation and intubation success rates of emergency medicine residents: a prospective descriptive study,"Background: Rapid and safe airway management has always been of paramount importance in successful management of critically ill and injured patients in the emergency department. The purpose of our study was to determine success rates of bag-mask ventilation and tracheal intubation performed by emergency medicine residents before and after completing their anesthesiology curriculum. Methods: A prospective descriptive study was conducted at Nikoukari Hospital, a teaching hospital located in Tabriz, Iran. In a skills lab, a total number of 18 emergency medicine residents (post graduate year 1) were given traditional intubation and bag-mask ventilation instructions in a 36 hour course combined with mannequin practice. Later the residents were given the opportunity of receiving training on airway management in an operating room for a period of one month which was considered as an additional training program added to their Anesthesiology Curriculum. Residents were asked to ventilate and intubate 18 patients (Mallampati class I and ASA class I and II) in the operating room; both before and after completing this additional training program. Intubation achieved at first attempt within 20 seconds was considered successful. Successful bag-mask ventilation was defined as increase in ETCo2 to 20 mm Hg and back to baseline with a 3 L/min fresh gas-flow and the adjustable pressure limiting valve at 20 cm H2O. An attending anesthesiologist who was always present in the operating room during the induction of anesthesia confirmed the endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy and capnography. Success rates were recorded and compared using McNemar, marginal homogeneity and paired t-Test tests in SPSS 15 software. Results: Before the additional training program in the operating room, the participants had intubation and bag-mask ventilation success rates of 27.7% (CI 0.07-0.49) and 16.6% (CI 0-0.34) respectively. After the additional training program in the operating room the success rates increased to 83.3% (CI 0.66-1) and 88.8% (CI 0.73-1), respectively. The differences in success rates were statistically significant (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0004, respectively). Conclusions: The success rate of emergency medicine residents in airway management improved significantly after completing anesthesiology rotation. Anesthesiology rotations should be considered as an essential component of emergency medicine training programs. A collateral curriculum of this nature should also focus on the acquisition of skills in airway management.",0,0
21189847,"Comparative study between I-gel, a new supraglottic airway device, and classical laryngeal mask airway in anesthetized spontaneously ventilated patients","Objective: To compare two different supraglottic airway devices, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and the I-gel, regarding easiness of insertion of the device, leak pressure, gastric insufflation, end tidal CO(2), oxygen saturation, hemodynamic and postoperative complications in anesthetized, spontaneously ventilated adult patients performing different non-emergency surgical procedures. Materials and methods: The study was carried out as a prospective, randomized, clinical trial among 80 patients who underwent different surgical procedures under general anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation in supine position. They were equally randomized into two groups: I-gel and LMA groups. Both the devices were compared with regard to heart rate, arterial BP, SPO(2), end-tidal CO(2), number and duration of insertion attempts, incidence of gastric insufflation, leak pressure and airway assessment after removal of the device. Results: No statistically significant difference was reported between both the groups, regarding heart rate, arterial BP, SPO(2) and end-tidal CO(2). The mean duration of insertion attempts was 15.6±4.9 seconds in the I-gel group, while it was 26.2±17.7 seconds in the LMA group. The difference between both the groups regarding duration of insertion attempts was statistically significant (P=0.0023*), while the number of insertion attempts was statistically insignificant between both the study groups (P>0.05). Leak pressure was (25.6±4.9 vs. 21.2±7.7 cm H(2)O) significantly higher among studied patients of the I-gel group (P=0.016*) and the incidence of gastric insufflation was significantly more with LMA group 9 (22.5%) vs. I-gel group (5%) (P=0.016). Conclusion: Both LMA and I-gel do not cause any significant alteration in the hemodynamic status of the patients, end tidal CO(2), and SPO(2). The postoperative complications were not significantly different except nusea and vomiting was statistically significant higher in LMA group (P=0.032). among both LMA and I-gel patients. Insertion of I-gel was significantly easier and more rapid than insertion of LMA. Leak pressure was significantly higher with I-gel than LMA and thus incidence of gastric insufflation was significantly lower with I-gel.",0,0

15346362,Fiberoptic assessment of laryngeal mask airway placement: blind insertion versus direct visual epiglottoscopy,"Purpose: The study aims to compare the frequency of ideal anatomic placement of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) using the traditional blind insertion approach with one where placement was facilitated by the use of a laryngoscope (epiglottoscopy). Patients and methods: A prospective comparison of 132 patients divided into 2 groups (38 with the blind technique and 94 with the direct technique) were evaluated with 2 airway assessment methods, Wilson and Mallampati. We also considered whether there was a relationship between these criteria and the successful placement into an ideal position. Other variables were considered, including breathing airflow dynamics, body size, and skill level of the anesthesia care provider. Five placement visual ordinals were used to grade the LMA position. Results: All of the patients studied except one had good to excellent breathing patterns after LMA placement. Statistically more patients who had ideal to nearly ideal placement position of the LMA were placed under direct epiglottoscopy than when placed by the classic blind technique. The position of the LMA was assessed by fiberoptic examination through an attachment between the LMA and the anesthetic circuit. Eighty-six of 94 patients (91.5%) in the direct visual placement group had ideal position compared with 16 of 38 (42%) in the blind placement group. Both groups had more successful placement than any other studies by comparison. Even several obese patients were successfully treated by either technique, and even the inexperienced anesthesia care provider could place the LMA with considerable accuracy. Conclusion: One hundred thirty-one of 132 patients had no airway difficulties after LMA placement with either blind (classic) or direct visual epiglottoscopy (laryngoscopy). A fiberoptic scope proved to be a valuable tool to assess the results. When ideal placement is either highly desirable or necessary, the direct visual technique is considered to be a better choice for placement than the blind, classic method.",0,0
12205572,Airway obstruction in children with congenital heart disease: assessment by flexible bronchoscopy,"We assessed the spectrum of airway disorders in children with congenital cardiac anomalies, and reviewed our experience in using flexible bronchoscopy for assessment of airway problems in this patient group. The clinical records, flexible bronchoscopic findings, and cardiac imaging results of pediatric cardiac patients who presented with either clinical or radiological signs of airway obstruction between 1992-1999 were reviewed. Flexible bronchoscopic assessment was performed with the patients under sedation and topical anesthesia, using one of two bronchoscopes, i.e., an Olympus BFN20 or Olympus BF3C20. Of a total of 52 patients, 33 had acyanotic cardiovascular lesions, the commonest being left-to-right shunts (61%), while 19 had cyanotic heart lesions, with right ventricular outflow obstruction being the commonest (63%). Twenty-seven patients had undergone either surgical or transcatheter interventions. The median age at bronchoscopic assessment was 6 months (range, 4 days to 6 years). None of the patients developed significant procedural complications. A definitive diagnosis was made in 48 (92%) patients, 8 of whom had abnormalities involving only the upper airways, 35 only the lower airways, and 5 both. Abnormalities of the upper airway included laryngomalacia (n = 6), subglottic stenosis (n = 3), pharyngeal collapse (n = 2), and 1 each of choanal stenosis and supraglottitis. Extrinsic compression was the commonest lower airway abnormality that was found in 27/40 patients (67%), with a predilection for the left main bronchus (18/27, 67%). The structures that caused extrinsic compression included dilated pulmonary arteries with or without left atrial dilation (n = 20), an anomalous aortic or pulmonary arterial course (n = 3), a dilated aorta (n = 1), and a shunt (n = 1), but were not obvious in 2 patients. Intrinsic lower airway abnormalities included bronchomalacia (n = 4), tracheal stenosis (n = 4), and one each of variant bronchial bifurcation and a pouch arising from the tracheal wall. Intraluminal mucus plugging of the lower airways occurred in the remaining 3 patients. Children with congenital heart disease are at risk of airway obstruction both before and after surgery. Flexible bronchoscopy, being safe and effective in diagnosing airway disorders in this patient group, should be considered as the first line of investigation.",0,0

Methods: Preoperatively, the view of the pharynx (Mallampati score), the thyromental distance and the inter-incisor distance at opening the month were assessed. After induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade, the two devices were inserted in turn in a randomized order. The views of the glottis (Cormack and Lehane classification) was compared between the two devices. Results: Mallampati score was 3 in one patient; the thyromental distance was less than 6 cm in 5 patients; and the inter-incisor distance was less than 4 cm in 2 patients. With the Pentax-AWS, the view of glottis was always grade 1, whereas with the Fineview, the view was grade 1 in 36 patients, grade 2 in 13 patients and grade 3 in one patient. The view was significantly better with the Pentax-AWS compared with the Fineview (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We conclude that the view of the glottis obtained using the Pentax-AWS was significantly better than the view obtained with the Fineview.",0,0
20805775,Airway scope laryngoscopy under manual inline stabilization and cervical collar immobilization: a crossover in vivo cinefluoroscopic study,"Background: Direct laryngoscopy along with manual inline stabilization (MIS) is currently the standard care for patients with suspected neck injuries. However, cervical collar immobilization is more commonly performed in the prehospital environment, and its early removal is necessary before intubation. We hypothesized that if usability of Airway Scope (AWS) in a difficult airway could also bring merits to intubation under cervical collar immobilization, unnecessary risk caused by the removal of a neck collar may be prevented. Methods: In this crossover study, 30 consenting patients presenting for surgery were assigned to undergo intubation using AWS. Neck was stabilized manually and by a neck collar in a random order before laryngoscopy was performed by the same anesthesiologist. Measurements include interincisor distance (IID), success rate, intubation time, and fluoroscopic examination of the upper and middle cervical spine. Results: IID was notably narrower after application of a neck collar (mean ± SE: MIS, 19 mm ± 1 mm; collar, 10 mm ± 1 mm; p < 0.01). One and 9 failures were encountered in MIS and collar groups, respectively (p = 0.012). Intubation time proved no statistical significance. Extension of craniocervical junction was observed in both groups, but occipitoatlantal joint was significantly more extended in collar group (median [range]: AWS, 10-degree angle [-1 to 20-degree angle]; collar, 14-degree angle [5 to 26-degree angle]; p < 0.01). Discussion: AWS laryngoscopy under cervical collar immobilization fails to meet our expectation. Intubation failed in 30% of the cases in collar group whereas only 3.3% of the cases in MIS group. Significant difference of mouth opening limitation is probably the major reason, as 7 of 9 failed cases in collar group had IID <10 mm. This was insufficient to insert the 18-mm blade of AWS. In addition, occipitoatlantal joint suffered a greater extension when wearing a neck collar. Differences in the method to stabilize the neck may be the reason. Conclusion: When compared with cervical collar immobilization, AWS laryngoscopy along with MIS seems to be a safer and more definite method to secure airway of neck-injured trauma patients because it limits less mouth opening and upper cervical spine movement.",0,0
8204237,Pyriform sinus perforation secondary to traumatic intubation in a difficult airway patient,Pyriform sinus perforation is a relatively rare complication of endotracheal intubation in anesthesia. It can occur after traumatic intubation and is potentially lethal. We recently encountered a patient who developed perforation of the left pyriform sinus when intubation was performed emergently by an inexperienced person in a difficult situation outside the operating room. Clinical manifestations and implications of this complication are discussed.,0,0
26955210,Comparison of upper lip bite test and ratio of height to thyromental distance with other airway assessment tests for predicting difficult endotracheal intubation,"Background: Various anatomical measurements and noninvasive clinical tests, singly or in various combinations can be performed to predict difficult intubation. Upper lip bite test (ULBT) and ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD) are claimed to have high predictability. Hence, we have conducted this study to compare the predictive value of ULBT and RHTMD with the following parameters: Mallampati grading, inter-incisor gap, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, head and neck movements, and horizontal length of mandible for predicting difficult intubation. Materials and methods: In this single blinded, prospective, observational study involving 170 adult patients of either sex belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I-III scheduled to undergo general anesthesia were recruited. All patients were subjected to the preoperative airway assessment and, the above parameters were recorded correlated with Cormack and Lehane grade and analyzed. The number of intubation attempts and use of intubation aids were also noted. Results: ULBT and RHTMD had highest sensitivity (96.64%, 90.72%), specificity (82.35%, 80.39%), positive predictive value (92.74%, 91.53%), and negative predictive value (91.3%, 78.8%), respectively, compared to other parameters. While odds ratio and likelihood ratio >1 for all the tests. Conclusion: ULBT can be used as a simple bedside screening test for prediction of difficult intubation, but it should be combined with other airway assessment tests for better airway predictability. RHTMD can also be used as an acceptable alternative.",0,0
24368866,Comparison of commercial and noncommercial endotracheal tube-securing devices,"Background: Tracheal intubation is used to establish a secure airway in patients who require mechanical ventilation. Unexpected extubation can have serious complications, including airway trauma and death. Various methods and devices have been developed to maintain endotracheal tube (ETT) security. Associated complications include pressure ulcers due to decreased tissue perfusion. Device consideration includes ease of use, rapid application, and low exerted pressure around the airway. Methods: Sixteen ETT holders were evaluated under a series of simulated clinical conditions. ETT security was tested by measuring distance displaced after a tug. Nine of the 16 methods could be evaluated for speed of moving the ETT to the opposite side of the mouth. Sensors located on a mannequin measured applied forces when the head was rotated vertically or horizontally. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, with P < .05. Results: Median displacement of the ETT by the tug test was 0 cm (interquartile range of 0.0-0.10 cm, P < .001). The mean time to move the ETT from one side of the mouth to the other ranged from 1.25 ± 0.2 s to 34.4 ± 3.4 s (P < .001). Forces applied to the face with a vertical head lift ranged from < 0.2 newtons (N) to a maximum of 3.52 N (P < .001). Forces applied to the face with a horizontal rotation ranged from < 0.2 N to 3.52 N (P < .001). Commercial devices produced greater force than noncommercial devices. Conclusions: Noncommercial airway holders exert less force on a patient's face than commercial devices. Airway stability is affected by the type of securing method. Many commercial holders allow for rapid but secure movement of the artificial airway from one side of the mouth to the other.",0,0
24015127,Outpatient endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: Safety and efficacy of anesthetic management with a natural airway in 653 consecutive procedures,"Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a unique diagnostic and therapeutic procedure performed in high risk patients in prone/semi-prone position. Propofol based deep sedation has emerged as the method of choice however, the ability to predict possible complications is yet un-explored. Aims: The present study aimed to evaluate known high risk-factors for general anesthesia (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, body mass index (BMI), and Mallampati class) for their ability to affect outcomes in ERCP patients. Study design: Retrospective data of 653 patients who underwent ERCP during a period of 26 months at university hospital of Pennsylvania was reviewed. Patient-specific and procedure specific data was extracted. Desaturation was defined by fall of pulse oximeter saturation below 95% and its relation to patient specific high risk-factors was analyzed. Results: Only 45 patients had transient de-saturation below 95% without any residual sequlae. No statistically significant relation between desaturation episodes and patients higher ASA status or BMI or modified Mallampati (MMP) class was found. Despite 60% patients being ASA III/IV none required emergency intubation or procedural interruption. Optimal oxygenation and airway patency was maintained with high degree of success using simple airway maneuvers or conduit devices (nasal/oral trumpet) with oxygen supplementation in all patients. Conclusions: Unlike general anesthesia, pre-operative patient ASA status, higher MMP or increasing BMI does not bear relation with likelihood of patients desaturating during ERCP. In presence of vigilant apnea monitoring and careful dose titration of maintenance anesthetics with airway conduits, general anesthesia, emergency intubations, and procedure interruptions can be avoided.",0,0

19946583,Tracheal agenesis as a rare cause of difficult intubation in a newborn with respiratory distress: a case report,"Introduction: Tracheal agenesis is a very rare congenital airway anomaly. It may pose a great challenge to the first attending physician both in diagnosis and in establishing the airway during the first day of life. Case presentation: We report a newborn Malay baby boy with trachea agenesis (type III by Floyd's classification) who presented with severe respiratory distress immediately after birth. Clinical diagnosis in this case was not straightforward, as it started with difficulty in intubation followed by an unsuccessful emergency tracheostomy in the neonatal intensive care unit. Urgent surgical neck exploration with endoscopic examination in the general operating theatre revealed the final diagnosis. The authors present a short description of the embryopathology and diagnostic criteria of the abnormality. Conclusion: We hope this case presentation will be valuable in increasing the awareness of physicians about this rare cause of tracheal obstruction or difficult intubation.",0,0
25114423,Ultrasound: A novel tool for airway imaging,"Context: The scope of ultrasound is emerging in medical science, particularly outside traditional areas of radiology practice. Aims: We designed this study to evaluate feasibility of bedside sonography as a tool for airway assessment and to describe sonographic anatomy of airway. Settings and design: A prospective, clinical study. Materials and methods: We included 100 adult, healthy volunteers of either sex to undergo airway imaging systemically starting from floor of the mouth to the sternal notch in anterior aspect of neck by sonography. Results: We could visualize mandible and hyoid bone as a bright hyperechoic structure with hypoechoic acoustic shadow underneath. Epiglottis, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, and tracheal rings appeared hypoechoic. Vocal cords were visualized through thyroid cartilage. Interface between air and mucosa lining the airway produced a bright hyperechoic linear appearance. Artifacts created by intraluminal air prevented visualization of posterior pharynx, posterior commissure, and posterior wall of trachea. Conclusions: Ultrasound is safe, quick, noninvasive, repeatable, and bedside tool to assess the airway and can provide real-time dynamic images relevant for several aspects of airway management.",0,0
12029399,Decision to extubate,"The need for reintubation within 24-72 h of planned extubation is a common event, occurring in 2-25% of extubated patients. Risk factors for extubation failure include being a medical, multidisciplinary or paediatric patient; age >70 years; a longer duration of mechanical ventilation; use of continuous intravenous sedation; and anaemia (haemoglobin <10 g/dl or haematocrit <30%) at the time of extubation. The pathophysiology of extubation failure can be distinct from that seen with weaning failure and includes upper airway obstruction, inadequate cough, excess respiratory secretions, encephalopathy, and cardiac dysfunction. Extubation failure prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation, increases the length of ICU and hospital stay, increases the need for tracheostomy, and is associated with a higher hospital mortality. Great emphasis has been placed on accurately predicting extubation outcome because extubation delay is also associated with increased length of stay and mortality. Tests designed to assess for upper airway obstruction, secretion volume, and the effectiveness of cough seem most promising for improving the decision to extubate. Mortality increases with delays in reintubation for patients failing extubation. Timely identification of patients at elevated risk of extubation failure followed by rapid re-establishment of ventilatory support can improve outcome.",0,0
25886221,Comparing ease of intubation in obese and lean patients using intubation difficulty scale,"Background: Difficult tracheal intubation contributes to significant morbidity and mortality during induction of anesthesia. There are divided opinions regarding ease of intubation in obese patients. Moreover, the definition of difficult intubation is not uniform; hence we have use the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) to find the incidence of difficult intubation in obese patients. Aims: The primary aim of the following study is to find out the incidence of difficult intubation in obese and lean patients using IDS and secondary aim is to assess the performance of bedside screening tests to predict difficult intubation, mask ventilation and laryngoscopy in obese and lean patients. Materials and methods: A prospective, observational cohort study of 200 patients requiring general anesthesia were categorized into 100 each based on body mass index (BMI) into lean (BMI <25 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m(2)) groups. IDS score ≥5 was termed as difficult intubation. Pre-operative airway assessment included Mallampati score, mouth opening, neck circumference (NC), upper lip bite test, thyromental distance, sternomental distance (SMD) and head neck mobility. Patients having difficulty in mask ventilation and laryngoscopy was recorded. Results: Over all in 200 patients the incidence of difficult intubation was 9%. Obese patients were slightly more difficult to intubate than lean (11% vs. 7%, P = 0.049). Age >40 years, NC >35 cm, SMD <12.5 cm and restricted head neck mobility were factors which were associated with IDS ≥5. Multivariate analysis revealed SMD <12.5 cm to predict difficult intubation in obese patients. Obese patients were difficult to mask ventilate (6% vs. 1%, P = 0.043). There was no difference regarding grading of laryngoscopy between the two groups. Conclusion: Obese patients are difficult to mask ventilate and intubate. During intubation of obese patients who is more than 40 years age and SMD <12.5 cm, it is preferable to have a second skilled anesthesiologist.",0,0
17952029,The unanticipated difficult intubation: rigid or flexible endoscope?,"Background: Unanticipated difficult intubation occurs with a frequency between 1.5% and 8.5%. The aim of this study was to compare the use of flexible versus rigid endoscopy in such a patient population, with respect to the preparation time and feasibility of each device. Methods: During a four-year observational period, 116 patients with unanticipated difficult intubation were managed either with the flexible fiberscope (FFI group, n= 57) or the rigid Bonfils endoscope (RBI group, n= 59) on a randomized basis. Results: The time required for preparing and performing the intubation was significantly shorter in the RBI group: median (IQR) 160 s (118-209 s) as opposed to 229 s (162-326 s) in the FFI group (P=0.001). There were no significant differences with respect to endoscopic visibility or quality of the intubation manoeuvre (P>0.1 each). Causes of unanticipated difficult intubation were mainly as follows: restricted movement of the head and neck (39.7%), a Mallampati class > 2 (35.3%), a short neck (31%) or a thyromental distance < or = 5 cm (28.4%). Postoperative complications associated with the intubation maneuver included slight bleeding (FFI = 8.8% vs RBI = 8.5%; NS), technical problems (12.3 vs 10.2%, NS), hoarseness (15.8 vs 15.3%, P=0.946) and dysphagia (5.3 vs 16.9%, P=0.070). Conclusion: Both endoscopic techniques enable quick and safe intubation. The Bonfils method could be the method of choice in cases of already relaxed patients with unanticipated difficult conventional laryngoscopy, presuming that the anaesthetist is familiar with this technique. Because the clinical re-evaluation for possible predictors of difficult intubation revealed no unknown new factors, the preoperative examination for anatomical peculiarities and being aware are the best protection against unanticipated intubation problems.",0,0
24744101,Novel use of a guidewire to facilitate intubation in an obstructing anterior mediastinal mass,"Purpose: This report describes the management of a life-threatening tracheal obstruction due to a thymoma in the anterior mediastinum and the use of a guidewire to facilitate intubation. Clinical features: Anesthetic management of patients presenting with large anterior mediastinal masses is always challenging. Catastrophic complications can occur after loss of consciousness due to compression of the airway, heart, or great vessels. Intrathoracic airway compression may become complete with a life-threatening inability to ventilate the lungs. We discuss the management of this case presenting to a regional centre prior to transfer to a tertiary care facility and point out current recommendations for pre-induction assessment and airway management in similar cases. Conclusion: Confirmed guidewire placement prior to induction enabled intubation in a setting without cardiothoracic backup capabilities.",0,0
26174747,[Comparison of five video laryngoscopes and conventional direct laryngoscopy : Investigations on simple and simulated difficult airways on the intubation trainer],"Introduction: Securing the airway with a tracheal tube is essential in emergency situations, in the intensive care setting as well as during anesthesia for surgery and other interventions. Current methods of airway assessment are poor screening tests for predicting difficult direct laryngoscopy due to a generally low positive predictive value; therefore, successful endotracheal intubation requires a high level of expertise, regular training and practice and sometimes additional tools. Currently, several video laryngoscopes (VL) with different designs are commercially available and have been investigated in a wide variety of settings. To our knowledge there is no prospective study evaluating and comparing performance among these three groups of VL; therefore, the aim of this study was to compare performance of five VL and conventional direct laryngoscopy in an intubation manikin model, both in a normal and simulated difficult intubation setting. Methods: In this study 10 residents, 12 senior staff physicians and 5 anesthesia nurses, all experienced in conventional direct laryngoscopy and inexperienced with VL underwent theoretical and hands-on training with all VL lasting 60 min. Afterwards participants performed intubation with all 5 VL and conventional direct laryngoscopy in a randomized sequence using an intubation manikin with normal intubation settings. Thereafter participants performed intubation in a simulated difficult intubation setting using the same intubation manikin with a neck collar to immobilize the cervical spine. In this study, the C-MAC(®) with Macintosh blade size 3, GlideScope(®) size 3, McGrath(®) series 5, King Vision(®) and Airtraq(®) size 2 were used. Time to intubation served as primary outcome and time to glottis visualization, number of intubation attempts, success rate and subjective evaluation of difficulty served as secondary outcomes. Results: In the normal intubation setting, time to intubation ranged from 16.0 s (conventional direct laryngoscopy) to 34.3 s (McGrath). GlideScope and conventional direct laryngoscopy were successful in 100 % followed by C-MAC (96.7 %), Airtraq (88.9 %), King Vision (77.8 %) and McGrath VL (44.4 %). In the simulated difficult intubation setting, time to intubation ranged between 20.3 s (Airtraq) and 26.7 s (McGrath). Success rate with C-MAC was 100 %, followed by GlideScope (96.7 %), Airtraq (85.2 %), conventional direct laryngoscopy (85.2 %), King Vision (81.5 %) and McGrath VL (70.4 %). Conclusion: In the manikin with normal intubation setting, conventional direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh blade was convincing and superior to any VL used in this study. During simulated difficult intubation, a blade with video transmission, such as C-MAC and the GlideScope were superior compared to conventional direct laryngoscopy and any other VL tested.",0,0
21042901,Less perilaryngeal gas leakage with SLIPA™ than with LMA-ProSeal™ in paralyzed patients,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the Streamlined Liner of the Pharynx Airway (SLIPA™) with the ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA-ProSeal™) in mechanically ventilated paralyzed patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. Methods: One hundred and one patients were allocated randomly to SLIPA (n = 50) or to LMA-ProSeal (n = 51) treatment groups. After induction of general anesthesia and insertion of the assigned supralaryngeal airway (SLA) device, we made note of the occurrence of any gastric insufflation and perilaryngeal leakage. We then evaluated the anatomical fit of the SLA device using a fibreoptic bronchoscope, and we assessed the airway sealing pressure and respiratory mechanics with change in head position and during peritoneal insufflation. After surgery, we evaluated the severity of postoperative sore throat and the presence of blood or regurgitated fluid on the SLA device. Results: The insertion success rate, gastric insufflation, perilaryngeal leakage, anatomical fit, airway sealing pressure, respiratory mechanics, severity of sore throat, and incidence of blood and regurgitated fluid on the device were similar between the two groups. The incidence of perilaryngeal leakage with changes in the patient's head position was lower with the SLIPA group than with the LMA-ProSeal group (3/50 vs 11/51, respectively; P = 0.026). During peritoneal insufflation, perilaryngeal leakage did not occur with the SLIPA but occurred in four cases with the LMA-ProSeal (P = 0.045). Conclusion: Both the SLIPA and the LMA-ProSeal can be used effectively and without severe complications in paralyzed patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. However, the SLIPA offers the advantage of less perilaryngeal gas leakage than the LMA-ProSeal with change in head position and during insufflation of the peritoneal cavity. This trial is registered with ANZCTR (ACTRN12609000914268).",0,0
22802693,Difficult airway and difficult intubation in postintubation tracheal stenosis: a case report and literature review,"Management of a ""difficult airway"" remains one of the most relevant and challenging tasks for anesthesiologists and pulmonary physicians. Several conditions, such as inflammation, trauma, tumor, and immunologic and metabolic diseases, are considered responsible for the difficult intubation of a critically ill patient. In this case report we present the case of a 46-year-old male with postintubation tracheal stenosis. We will focus on the method of intubation used, since the patient had a ""difficult airway"" and had to be intubated immediately because he was in a life-threatening situation. Although technology is of utter importance, clinical examination and history-taking remain invaluable for the appropriate evaluation of the critically ill patient in everyday medical life. Every physician who will be required to perform intubation has to be familiar with the evaluation of the difficult airway and, in the event of the unanticipated difficult airway, to be able to use a wide variety of tools and techniques to avoid complications and fatality.",0,0

Securing airway by nasotracheal intubation and tracheostomy are associated with potential complications. Flexible fiberoscope is not available in all the institutes. Submental intubation using intubating laryngeal mask airway is an acceptable alternative technique in such situations. It also provides an unobstructed surgical field.,0,0
19378536,Anesthesia in a patient with multiple endocrine abnormalities. Case report,"Background and objectives: Insulinoma is the most common pancreatic endocrine tumor and it can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). This is a report on a patient with multiple endocrine abnormalities, who did not fulfill the criteria of known syndromes (MEN) and the clinical-anesthetic particularities that influenced the anesthetic management. CASE REPORT A 23-year old female patient with episodes of hypoglycemia difficult to control, associated with Cushing's disease and prolactinoma without symptoms of pituitary compression and with normal thyroid and parathyroid. Investigation found a retroperitoneal mass of unknown origin which in face of the clinical presentation raised the hypothesis of insulinoma. The patient also referred to be a Jehovah's Witness. Biopsy of the mass by video-laparoscopy and enucleation of the insulinoma were proposed. On physical exam the patient was overweight, had protruding teeth, she was classified as Mallampati 3 and had symptoms of sleep apnea. Laboratorial exams revealed hematocrit 58%. Pre-anesthetic medication consisted of oral midazolam (7.5 mg) and clonidine (200 microg). Fentanyl (150 microg), clonidine (90 microg), propofol (150 mg) and pancuronium (8 mg) were used for anesthetic induction and she was intubated without intercurrences. Central venous access and invasive blood monitoring were instituted. Intravenous infusion of D5W with electrolytes was instituted and capillary glucose levels were monitored every 30 minutes, which did not demonstrate any episodes of hypoglycemia during the surgery. The patient remained hemodynamically stable even during the pneumoperitoneum. She developed postoperative episodes of hypoglycemia, which motivated the re-operation. Conclusions: This case is unique due to the presence of multiple endocrine abnormalities and the particularities of the surgical-anesthetic management. Intraoperative monitoring is mandatory during removal of an insulinoma to avoid incomplete tumor resection. Multiple challenges in one patient demand the knowledge, by the anesthesiologist, of each obstacle and its interactions in order to devise strategies to control them.",0,0

24907879,Preanesthetic assessment data do not influence the time for tracheal intubation with Airtraq™ video laryngoscope in obese patients,"Purpose: this study investigated the influence of anatomical predictors on difficult laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation in obese patients by comparing Macintosh and Airtraq™ laryngoscopes. Methods: from 132 bariatric surgery patients (body mass index ≥ 35 kgm(-1)), cervical perimeter, sternomental distance, interincisor distance, and Mallampati score were recorded. The patients were randomized into two groups according to whether a Macintosh (n=64) or an Airtraq™ (n=68) laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation. Time required for intubation was the first outcome. Cormack-Lehane score, number of intubation attempts, the Macintosh blade used, any need for external tracheal compression or the use of gum elastic bougie were recorded. Intubation failure and strategies adopted were also registered. Results: intubation failed in two patients in the Macintosh laryngoscope group, and these patients were included as worst cases scenario. The intubation times were 36.9+22.8s and 13.7+3.1s for the Macintosh and Airtraq™ laryngoscope groups (p<0.01), respectively. Cormack-Lehane scores were also lower for the Airtraq™ group. One patient in the Macintosh group with intubation failure was quickly intubated with the Airtraq™. Cervical circumference (p<0.01) and interincisor distance (p<0.05) influenced the time required for intubation in the Macintosh group but not in the Airtraq™ group. Conclusion: in obese patients despite increased neck circumference and limited mouth opening, the Airtraq™ laryngoscope affords faster tracheal intubation than the Macintosh laryngoscope, and it may serve as an alternative when conventional laryngoscopy fails.",0,0
23878440,Predictive value of upper lip bite test and ratio of height to thyromental distance compared to other multivariate airway assessment tests for difficult laryngoscopy in apparently normal patients,"Background: Various anatomical measurements and non-invasive clinical tests, singly or in various combinations can be performed to predict difficult intubation. Recently introduced ""Upper lip bite test"" (ULBT) and ""Ratio of height to Thyromental distance"" (RHTMD) are claimed to have high predictability. We conducted a study to compare the Predictive Value of ULBT and RHTMD with Mouth opening (Inter-Incisor gap) (IIG), Modified Mallampatti Test (MMT), Head and neck movement (HNM) and Thyromental Distance (TMD) for Difficult Laryngoscopy. Materials and methods: In this prospective, single blinded observational study, 480 adult patients of either sex, ASA grade I and II were assessed and graded for ULBT, RHTMD, TMD, MMT, IIG, and HNM according to standard methods and correlated with the Cormack and Lehane grade. Results: ULBT and RHTMD had highest sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio, i.e., 74.63%, 91.53%, 58.82%, 95.7%, 31.765 and 71.64%, 92.01%, 59.26%, 95.24%, 8.96 respectively, compared to TMD, MMT, IIG and HNM.

19100929,Fiberoptic bronchoscopic view change of laryngopharyngeal tissues by different airway supporting techniques: comparison of patients with and without open mouth limitation,"Study objective: To investigate the changes in view of the laryngopharyngeal tissues on the fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) with different techniques of supporting the airway. Design: Prospective, observational, stratified study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: 40 ASA physical status I, II, and III men undergoing elective oromaxillofacial surgery during general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. Interventions: Patients were allocated into the normal mouth-opening group (Group N) or the limited mouth-opening group (Group L) to determine the grade of view of the laryngopharyngeal tissues exposed on the FOB, with 5 different airway supporting techniques: original airway position (OA), triple airway (TA), jaw thrust with opened mouth (JTO), jaw thrust with teeth protrusion (JTP), and head tilt with chin lift (HT). Measurement and main results: An adequate airway support was defined as having nearly full visibility of the entire glottic inlet. The investigator graded the vision of both anterior and posterior laryngopharyngeal tissues of each patient. All subjects experienced adequate airway support with the TA and HT airway supporting techniques. The TA airway supporting technique significantly moved the posterior laryngeal tissues more upward in Group N than Group L (P = 0.027). The JTP airway supporting technique provided adequate airway support for 14 of the 20 patients in Group N but only for two of the 20 Group L patients (P < .001). Conclusion: Both the TA and HT techniques provided adequate airway support for patients with and without limited mouth opening.",0,0
23407694,Subjective assessment using still bronchoscopic images misclassifies airway narrowing in laryngotracheal stenosis,"Objectives: Severity of airway narrowing is relevant to management decision-making processes in patients with laryngotracheal stenosis. Airway lumen is frequently assessed subjectively based on still images obtained during airway examinations or objectively using image analysis software applied to radiological or bronchoscopic images. The purpose of this study was to determine whether strictures classified as mild, moderate or severe degrees of airway narrowing based on subjective assessments by a group of experienced bronchoscopists using still images, matched the classifications derived from morphometric bronchoscopy measurements and whether the results of subjective assessments correlated with the level of bronchoscopic experience. Methods: Thirty-five bronchoscopic doublet still images of benign causes of laryngotracheal stenosis containing normal and abnormal airway cross-sectional areas were objectively analysed using morphometric bronchoscopy and classified as mild (<50%), moderate (50-70%) or severe (>70%). These images were then subjectively assessed by 42 experienced bronchoscopists participating in an interventional bronchoscopy course. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the accuracy of the participants' classifications. Correlation coefficients were used to study the relationship between participants' subjective assessments and bronchoscopy experience. Results: Only 47% of strictures were correctly classified by study participants (mean 16.48 ± 2.8). Of the 1447 responses included in this analysis, 755 were incorrect: 71 (9%) were over-classifications of strictures' severity and 684 (91%) were under-classifications. There was no correlation between number of strictures correctly classified and number of lifetime bronchoscopies or number of strictures seen by bronchoscopists in an average month. Conclusions: Experienced bronchoscopists often misclassify the degree of airway narrowing when using still bronchoscopic images to subjectively assess strictures of benign aetiology.",0,0
24565350,Life-threatening airway obstruction due to upper airway edema and marked neck swelling after labor and delivery,"Background and objectives: Airway changes generally occur in normal gravidas; however, these changes could cause critical situations in specific populations. Objectives: This article presents the case of a difficult airway patient that went into shock because of atonic bleeding after vaginal delivery for stillbirth. Case report: A 32-yr-old woman with atonic bleeding after vaginal delivery for stillbirth was transferred to our hospital. She manifested shock, and her respiratory condition was progressively deteriorating. Airway obstruction caused by neck swelling and pharyngolaryngeal edema was apparent. We tried tracheal intubation using direct and indirect laryngoscopes. However, it turned out that insertion of the laryngoscopic devices to the oral cavity was impossible. After several attempts using the Trachlight™, successful intubation was finally made. After hysterectomy, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated for five days. At discharge from the ICU, her Mallampati score was I-II. Her body weight decreased 60 kg to 51 kg during ICU stay. Conclusions: We believe that concomitant attacks of labor and delivery and fluid resuscitation probably worsened upper airway and neck edema enough to cause acute airway obstruction and difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
22425162,Indirect laryngoscopy with rigid 70-degree laryngoscope as a predictor of difficult direct laryngoscopy,"Introduction and objectives: The commonly-used predictors for difficult airway management are not very accurate. We investigate the power of indirect laryngoscopy with the rigid 70-degree laryngoscope as a predictor of difficult visualisation of the larynx with direct laryngoscopy. Methods: We performed preoperative indirect laryngoscopy with the rigid laryngoscope on 300 patients. The vision obtained was classified into four grades: 1 (vocal cords visible), 2 (posterior commissure visible), 3 (epiglottis visible) and 4 (no glottic structure visible). Grades 3 and 4 were considered predictors of difficult larynx visualisation. Next, direct laryngoscopy with the Macintosh laryngoscope was carried out on the patients under general anaesthesia. Positive value was defined as a Cormack and Lehane III and IV. Other common clinical predictors were also analysed. A logistic regression model using the relevant variables was elaborated. We also investigated predictors of difficult visualisation of the larynx with indirect laryngoscopy. Results: The model found and the coefficients for preparing it were: f(x)= -10.097+5.145 indirect laryngoscopy (3-4)+3.489 retrognathia+2.548 mouth opening <3.5 cm+1.911 thyromental distance <6.5 cm+.352 snorer+(0.151 cm neck thickness). This model provided a correct result in 94.3% of cases. In the case of indirect laryngoscopy, the model found was: f(x)=-2.641+0.920 snorer+0.875 cervical mobility. Conclusions: Indirect laryngoscopy was the independent variable with the greatest predictive power. Snoring is a common predictor in both laryngoscopy models.",0,0
24960030,Evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia by dynamic flexible bronchoscopy. A pilot study,"Objectives: Dynamic flexible bronchoscopy is the ""gold standard"" for assessing changes in airway luminal size associated with tracheobronchomalacia, but the procedure has not been adequately validated. The present study was designed to test the validity of diagnosing tracheobronchomalacia by dynamic flexible bronchoscopy through assessing inter- and intraobserver agreements in estimating degree of central airway collapse associated with tracheobronchomalacia. Methods: This prospective observational pilot study enrolled consecutive patients with suspected tracheobronchomalacia scheduled for dynamic flexible bronchoscopy. Images of the airway lumen were obtained at five different sites in the tracheobronchial tree during forced inspiration and expiration and were evaluated by 23 pulmonologists (not involved in the care of study patients) with different levels of training and experience at baseline (interobserver agreement) and 8 days later (intraobserver agreement). The degree of airway collapse was visually estimated by each examiner and expressed as a percentage of narrowing. A multirater generalized kappa-type statistical method was used to calculate the correlation coefficients and to assess reliability of the measurements obtained during dynamic flexible bronchoscopy. Measurements and main results: Between September 1 and 30, 2009, 10 patients (median age, 65 yr) underwent dynamic flexible bronchoscopy. The correlation coefficients for inter- and intraobserver agreement were favorable and ranged for the five airway sites from 0.68 to 0.92 and from 0.80 to 0.96, respectively. Conclusions: The favorable inter- and intraobserver agreements among 23 pulmonologists using dynamic flexible bronchoscopy to estimate the degree of dynamic central airway collapse provide additional evidence that dynamic flexible bronchoscopy is a reliable diagnostic tool for tracheobronchomalacia.",0,0
11371421,Increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in small airway epithelium from tobacco smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"Tobacco smoke is believed to cause small airway disease and then chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the molecular mechanisms by which small airway obstruction occurs remain unknown. To study the gene expression levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a potent fibrogenic factor, in small airway epithelium from smokers and patients with COPD, we harvested highly pure samples of epithelial cells from small airways under direct vision by using an ultrathin bronchofiberscope BF-2.7T (outer diameter 2.7 mm with a biopsy channel of 0.8 mm in diameter). The expression levels of TGF-beta1 were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mRNA levels of TGF-beta1 corrected by beta-actin transcripts were significantly higher in the smoking group and patients with COPD than those in nonsmokers (p < 0.01). Furthermore, among smokers and patients with COPD, TGF-beta1 mRNA levels correlated positively with the extent of smoking history (pack-years) and the degree of small airway obstruction as assessed by measurements of flow-volume curves. Immunocytochemistry of the cells demonstrated more intense stainings for TGF-beta1 in samples from smokers and patients with COPD than from nonsmokers. Spontaneously released immunoreactive TGF-beta1 levels from cultured epithelial cells were more elevated in subjects with a history of smoking and patients with COPD than in nonsmokers. Our study showed a close link between smoking and expression of TGF-beta1 in small airways. Our results also suggested that small airway epithelial cells might be involved in obstructive changes found in smokers and patients with COPD.",0,0
9018265,Endoscopically introduced expandable stents in laryngotracheal stenosis: the jury is still out,"A new technique using endoscopically introduced, expandable stents for the management of upper airway stenosis is presented. Evaluation of this technique in the canine model forms the basis of this pilot study. Stenosis was surgically induced in a controlled fashion by resection of cartilage from the anterior cricoid arch and tracheal wall to reduce the airway diameter by approximately 50%. A period of 8 weeks was allowed for complete healing and maturation of the surgical stenosis. This was followed by endoscopic introduction of expandable titanium-mesh stents. The stents were then balloon-inflated to dilate the stenotic region. Airway patency was assessed clinically, radiologically, and endoscopically, before expansion and at 4 and 8 weeks after expansion. This assessment was followed by euthanasia of the animals and gross examination of the expanded stenotic segments. In general, the stents were well tolerated with adequate expansion of the airway. In some instances granulation tissue formation was noted around the stents. This was less pronounced when stents coated with Tecoflex (Advanced Surgical Intervention Co., San Clemente, Calif.) were used. This is probably because of their ""inert"" nature, which induces less tissue reaction. A literature review of the subject is presented. The significance of this endoscopic modality for management of upper airway stenosis is discussed, and the indications, alternatives, potential pitfalls, and complications are depicted.",0,0
7917726,Prediction of difficult tracheal intubation,"Three hundred and fifty consecutive patients (322 non-obstetric, 28 obstetric; 185 female) were assessed before operation using the modified Mallampati test and by measuring thyromental and sternomental distances, forward protrusion of the mandible and interincisor gap with the mouth fully open. Tracheal intubation was difficult in 17 (4.9%) patients, of whom four (1.14%) had a grade III or IV view on laryngoscopy. A sternomental distance of 12.5 cm or less with the head fully extended on the neck and the mouth closed predicted 14 of the 17 patients in whom tracheal intubation was difficult. As a screening test, sternomental distance appeared to be more sensitive (82.4%) and more specific (88.6%) than thyromental distance (64.7% and 81.4%, respectively), the modified Mallampati test (64.7% and 66.1%, respectively) and forward protrusion of the mandible (29.4% and 85.0%, respectively). The interincisor gap ranged from 2.0 to 5.0 cm in all patients except one. There was no correlation between the interincisor gap and the view on laryngoscopy (P > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). There was also no difference in mean interincisor gap between those patients who presented no difficulty with tracheal intubation and those who did (P = 0.7-0.8, two sample t test). Sternomental distance may be a useful bedside screening test for preoperative prediction of difficult tracheal intubation.",1,1
23506414,A randomized controlled comparison of the Bonfils fiberscope and the GlideScope Cobalt AVL video laryngoscope for visualization of the larynx and intubation of the trachea in infants and small children with normal airways,"Background: The Bonfils fiberscope (BF) used without the assistance of a laryngoscope failed to improve the view of direct laryngoscopy in children with normal airways. We hypothesized that if BF is supported by a laryngoscope--as recommended by its inventor--it can provide comparably good visualization of the glottis as the GlideScope(®) Cobalt AVL video laryngoscope (GS). Methods: We included 100 children with normal airways in a randomized controlled trial. The study consisted of assessing the airway by direct laryngoscopy (DL), followed by intubation using either the BF or the GlideScope. Main outcome measures were the quality of visualization of the larynx by the percentage of glottis opening seen (POGO) and the time needed for intubation of the trachea. Results: Visualization of the larynx (POGO) using the BF was significantly better than with DL (P = 0.016) or with GS (P = 0.001). The DL provided an allover better visualization than GS, although this difference was not significant and solely attributable to children weighing <15 kg. Intubation was successful in all cases with both devices. The time needed for intubation was shorter using the BF (36 ± 8 s) than with the GlideScope (49 ± 12 s, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The Bonfils fiberscope significantly improved the view on the larynx compared with direct laryngoscopy and the GlideScope and enables shorter intubation time than with the GlideScope.",0,0

9038458,Tissue expander causing iatrogenic difficult intubation,"Difficulty during tracheal intubation may occur due to a number of anatomical factors and pathological conditions. These factors may be influenced by earlier surgical manoeuvres, so that difficulty may occasionally be encountered at subsequent operation. One such case of 'iatrogenic' difficulty, where a tissue expander beneath the anterolateral skin of the neck caused transient intubation problems, is reported.",0,0
25097745,Point-of-care ultrasound detection of tracheal wall thickening caused by smoke inhalation,"Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of death due to fires. When a patient presents with smoke inhalation, prompt assessment of the airway and breathing is necessary. Point-of-care ultrasonography (US) is used for the rapid assessment of critically ill or injured patients. We herein present a case report of a 54-year-old male who was transferred to the emergency department with shortness of breath, coughing, carbonaceous sputa, and rhinorrhea after inhaling smoke caused by a fire in his locked bedroom. He had no surface burns on the face and no edema or erosion in the oral cavity. He had hoarseness without stridor. His breath sounds were positive for expiratory wheezes. Laryngoscopy showed light edema and erosive findings on the supraglottic region. Bedside point-of-care US revealed hypoechoic thickening of the tracheal wall. The thickening was confirmed by a computed tomographic scan. The patient was carefully monitored with preparation for emergency airway management and was treated with supplemental oxygen and an aerosolized beta-2 adrenergic agonist in the intensive care unit. The symptoms were subsequently relieved, and reexamination by US after 2 days showed remission of the wall thickening. Point-of-care US may therefore be a useful modality for the rapid diagnosis and effective follow-up of tracheal wall thickening caused by smoke inhalation.",0,0
16895257,Physical examination: Mallampati score as an independent predictor of obstructive sleep apnea,"Study objective: To assess the clinical usefulness of the Mallampati score in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Mallampati scoring of the orophyarynx is a simple noninvasive method used to assess the difficulty of endotracheal intubation, but its clinical usefulness has not been validated in patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Design: Prospective multivariate assessment of a predictor variable. Setting: The UCSF Sleep Disorders Center. Patients or participants: One hundred thirty-seven adult patients who were evaluated for possible obstructive sleep apnea. Interventions: Prospective determination of the Mallampati score, assessment of other variables for multivariate analysis, and subsequent overnight polysomnography. Measurements and results: The Mallampati score was an independent predictor of both the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea. On average, for every 1-point increase in the Mallampati score, the odds of having obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index> or = 5) increased more than 2-fold (odds ratio [per 1-point increase] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-5.0; p = .01), and the apnea-hypopnea index increased by more than 5 events per hour (coefficient = 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 0.2-10; p = .04). These results were independent of more than 30 variables that reflected airway anatomy, body habitus, symptoms, and medical history. Conclusion: Our results indicate that Mallampati scoring is a useful part of the physical examination of patients prior to polysomnography. The independent association between Mallampati score and presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea suggests that this scoring system will have practical value in clinical settings and prospective studies of sleep-disordered breathing.",0,0
12712785,An evaluation of the flexiguide introducer with the flexible laryngeal mask airway,Insertion of the flexible Laryngeal Mask Airway has been achieved by a variety of techniques. We have evaluated the Flexiguide for aiding introduction of a flexible Laryngeal Mask Airway in 100 anaesthetised patients. We were successful in establishing a clear airway on the first attempt on 84 (84%) occasions and within two attempts in 97 (97%). The positioning of the laryngeal mask airway was assessed by five measures and was optimally placed in 85% of cases and good in 96%. A clear airway was achieved in 92% of cases. Insertion of the flexible Laryngeal Mask Airway with the Flexiguide was easy in 82 (82%) and slightly difficult in 15 (15%) of cases. Removal of the Flexiguide from the device was easy in 95 (95%) of cases. Airway manoeuvres were used to assist airway placement in 55% of cases with jaw thrust being most common. Minor complications occurred in three (3%) patients: two coughed and one experienced minor tissue trauma during mask insertion. There were no complications associated with use of the Flexiguide during the procedure or after anaesthesia. The Flexiguide is a useful tool to assist insertion of the flexible Laryngeal Mask Airway and is associated with few complications.,0,0
24132407,The difficult airway with recommendations for management--part 1--difficult tracheal intubation encountered in an unconscious/induced patient,"Background: Previously active in the mid-1990s, the Canadian Airway Focus Group (CAFG) studied the unanticipated difficult airway and made recommendations on management in a 1998 publication. The CAFG has since reconvened to examine more recent scientific literature on airway management. The Focus Group's mandate for this article was to arrive at updated practice recommendations for management of the unconscious/induced patient in whom difficult or failed tracheal intubation is encountered. Methods: Nineteen clinicians with backgrounds in anesthesia, emergency medicine, and intensive care joined this iteration of the CAFG. Each member was assigned topics and conducted reviews of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Results were presented and discussed during multiple teleconferences and two face-to-face meetings. When appropriate, evidence- or consensus-based recommendations were made together with assigned levels of evidence modelled after previously published criteria. Conclusions: The clinician must be aware of the potential for harm to the patient that can occur with multiple attempts at tracheal intubation. This likelihood can be minimized by moving early from an unsuccessful primary intubation technique to an alternative ""Plan B"" technique if oxygenation by face mask or ventilation using a supraglottic device is non-problematic. Irrespective of the technique(s) used, failure to achieve successful tracheal intubation in a maximum of three attempts defines failed tracheal intubation and signals the need to engage an exit strategy. Failure to oxygenate by face mask or supraglottic device ventilation occurring in conjunction with failed tracheal intubation defines a failed oxygenation, ""cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate"" situation. Cricothyrotomy must then be undertaken without delay, although if not already tried, an expedited and concurrent attempt can be made to place a supraglottic device.",0,0
20837873,Proinflammatory doses of diesel exhaust in healthy subjects fail to elicit equivalent or augmented airway inflammation in subjects with asthma,"Background: Exposure to traffic-derived air pollutants, particularly diesel emissions, has been associated with adverse health effects, predominantly in individuals with pre-existing respiratory disease. Here the hypothesis that this heightened sensitivity reflects an augmentation of the transient inflammatory response previously reported in healthy adults exposed to diesel exhaust is examined. Methods: 32 subjects with asthma (mild to moderate severity) and 23 healthy controls were exposed in a double-blinded crossover control fashion to both filtered air and diesel exhaust (100 μg/m(3) PM(10)) for 2 h. Airway inflammation was assessed by bronchoscopy 18 h postexposure. In addition, lung function, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide and bronchial reactivity to metacholine were examined in the subjects with asthma. Results: In healthy control subjects a significant increase in submucosal neutrophils (p=0.004) was observed following the diesel challenge. Significant increases in neutrophil numbers (p=0.01), and in the concentrations of interleukin 6 (p=0.03) and myeloperoxidase (p=0.04), were also seen in bronchial wash after diesel, relative to the control air challenge. No evidence of enhanced airway inflammation was observed in the subjects with asthma following the diesel exposure. Conclusions: Exposure to diesel exhaust at concentrations consistent with roadside levels elicited an acute and active neutrophilic inflammation in the airways of healthy subjects. This response was absent in subjects with asthma, as was evidence supporting a worsening of allergic airway inflammation.",0,0
22991805,[Vanishing glottis cyst following difficult intubation],"A 68-year-old male patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. Following anesthesia induction and muscle relaxation, laryngoscopy using Macintosh laryngoscope found a tumor of thumb size above the glottis completely obscuring the vocal cords. There appeared to be a possibility of tumor impaction into the glottis leading to total obstruction when the tumor was pushed down by a tracheal tube. Consent was obtained for emergency tracheostomy if necessary. The glottis and its surrounding were thoroughly observed using a fiberscope via the Fastrach laryngeal mask. The tumor appeared to be a soft cyst. A fiberoptic bronchoscope, tentatively introduced into the gap between the cyst and the epiglottis, went unexpectedly and smoothly into the trachea. A tracheal tube was introduced railroading over it. Information collected so far suggested that the patient was able to breathe without tracheal tube. As expected the patient did not show any difficulty in breathing and phonation following extubation. Seven days afterward, E.N.T. surgeon found no evidence of scarring or healing in the throat. The cyst might have been ruptured at the time of extubation or afterward, or absorbed.",0,0
9439393,Neonatal upper airway assessment by awake flexible laryngoscopy,"Awake flexible laryngoscopy (AFL) provides simple and quick assessment of both the structure and function of the upper airway. To determine its value in neonates, a prospective study was carried out over 2 years of 110 neonates (80 term, 30 premature) under 6 weeks of age (corrected for prematurity) presenting with symptoms suggestive of upper airway disease who underwent AFL performed by the author. A diagnosis was made in 79 cases, while no cause was found for the symptoms in 31. The commonest diagnoses were vocal cord paralysis (29; bilateral 16, unilateral 13), nasal stenosis (9), laryngomalacia (9), glossoptosis (7), subglottic stenosis (6), and choanal atresia (5; bilateral 2, unilateral 3). The AFL was repeated in 31 neonates and the condition was found to be stable in 16, improved in 8, resolved in 2, and progressed in 1, and an additional diagnosis was made in 4. Endoscopy under general anesthesia with or without corrective surgery was performed in 15 neonates (7 also having repeat AFL). The diagnosis was confirmed in 14 and an additional tracheal abnormality was found in 1. The AFL was complicated by cyanosis in 2 neonates and epistaxis in 1, but all complications resolved with minimal intervention. These data suggest that the neonatal upper airway can be relatively safely and reliably assessed by AFL performed by an experienced clinician.",0,0

12197164,The most frequent problems in the initial stage of burn management,"On the basis of three case reports discussed in the article, the authors demonstrate the most frequent serious drawbacks occurring in the initial stage of care of severely burned patients. The first case report highlights the importance of correct determination of the extent of the burn trauma, which should be correctly assessed by every first contact physician. The second case report demonstrates the need for adequate management of patients with severe burn trauma (especially airway management and i.v. establishment). In the third case (a little baby) again the need for correct patient assessment, timely airway management and beginning of resuscitation and especially of appropriate and immediate transfer of the burned patient to the specialized burn facility are highlighted.",0,0
16492859,Unanticipated difficult endotracheal intubations in patients with cervical spine instrumentation,"We present two cases of unanticipated difficult airway in patients requiring reoperation after cervical spine instrumentation. In both cases, the upper airway examination was normal, and fiberoptic-guided intubation proceeded with the patient sedated and breathing spontaneously. Cord visualization was difficult, but the scope was eventually advanced into the trachea and the endotracheal tube placed safely. Later review of radiographs showed the previously unrecognized protrusion of cervical hardware into the meso- and hypopharynx. We recommend that anesthesiologists review recent radiographic studies for potential airway compromise before approaching the airway of patients presenting for revision of cervical instrumentation.",0,0
8434755,Estimation of the correct length of tracheal tubes in adults,"Estimation of the correct length of a tracheal tube is extremely important and should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient. One hundred and eight patients who required tracheal intubation during anaesthesia were studied. The predicted length was estimated in each patient before induction of anaesthesia. The upper end of the cuff was aligned externally with the cricoid cartilage, while the more proximal part of the tube lay alongside the neck to the angle of the mandible. The tube was then curved forwards towards the upper incisor teeth, and the length at the teeth or gums was noted. The anaesthetist, who was unaware of the predicted length, intubated the trachea after induction of anaesthesia. The length of tube inserted was standardised in relation to the vocal cords, and the actual length of tube inserted was recorded. The estimated length was within 1.0 cm and 1.5 cm of the actual length in 91% and 97% of patients respectively.",0,0
8638791,Preoperative airway assessment: predictive value of a multivariate risk index,"Using readily available and objective airway risk criteria, a multivariate model for stratifying risk of difficult endotracheal intubation was developed and its accuracy compared to currently applied clinical methods. We studied 10,507 consecutive patients who were prospectively assessed prior to general anesthesia with respect to mouth opening, thyromental distance, oropharyngeal (Mallampati) classification, neck movement, ability to prognath, body weight, and history of difficult tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, the laryngeal view during rigid laryngoscopy was graded and the ability of experienced anesthesia personnel to ventilate via a mask was determined. Poor intubating conditions (laryngoscopy Grade IV) and inability to achieve adequate mask ventilation were identified in 107 (1%) and 8 (0.07%) cases, respectively. Logistic regression identified all seven criteria as independent predictors of difficulty with laryngoscopic visualization. A composite airway risk index (derived from nominalized odds ratios calculated from the multivariate model) as well a simplified (0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high) risk weighting exhibited higher positive predictive value for laryngoscopy Grade IV at scores with similar sensitivity to Mallampati class III, as well as higher sensitivity at scores with similar positive predictive value. Compared to Mallampati class I fewer false-negative predictions were observed at a risk index value of 0. We conclude that improved risk stratification for difficulty with visualization during rigid laryngoscopy (Grade IV) can be obtained by use of a simplified preoperative multivariate airway risk index, with better accuracy compared to oropharyngeal (Mallampati) classification at both low- and high-risk levels.",1,1

This article presents the case of a 12-year-old girl with KFS planned for scoliosis surgery. A short, rigid neck and limited mouth opening were predictors of difficult airway access. After failing multiple intubation attempts employing several devices, the case was postponed. Imaging tests showed lingual tonsil hypertrophy and a deviation of the tracheal axis, clarifying the causes of the failed intubation and suggesting new approaches for airway management. As far as we know, the association of KFS and lingual tonsil hypertrophy has not been reported before in the literature.",0,0
1224939,A difficult intubation,This paper describes a case of a difficult intubation in a neonate with the Pierre-Robin syndrome.

24885548,Detailed statistical analysis plan for the difficult airway management (DIFFICAIR) trial,"Background: Preoperative airway assessment in Denmark is based on a non-specific clinical assessment left to the discretion of the responsible anesthesiologist. The DIFFICAIR trial compares the effect of using a systematic and consistent airway assessment versus a non-specific clinical assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management.To prevent outcome bias and selective reporting, we hereby present a detailed statistical analysis plan as an amendment (update) to the previously published protocol for the DIFFICAIR trial. Method/design: The DIFFICAIR trial is a stratified, parallel group, cluster (cluster = department) randomized multicenter trial involving 28 departments of anesthesia in Denmark randomized to airway assessment either by the Simplified Airway Risk Index (SARI) or by a usual non-specific assessment. Data from patients' preoperative airway assessment are registered in the Danish Anesthesia Database. An objective score for intubation grading the severity, that is the severity of the intubations, as well as the frequency of unanticipated difficult intubation, is measured for each group.Primary outcome measures are the fraction of unanticipated difficult and easy intubations.The database is programmed so that the registration of the SARI is mandatory for the intervention group but invisible to controls.Data recruitment was commenced in October 2012 and ended in ultimo December 2013. Conclusion: We intend to increase the transparency of the data analyses regarding the DIFFICAIR trial by an a priori publication of a statistical analysis plan.

21077917,Exercising videoendoscopic evaluation of 45 horses with respiratory noise and/or poor performance after laryngoplasty,"Objective: To (1) assess upper airway function by videoendoscopy in horses performing poorly after laryngoplasty and (2) establish whether dynamic collapse of the left arytenoid can be predicted by the degree of resting postsurgical abduction. Study design: Case series. Animals: Horses that had left laryngoplasty (n=45). Methods: Medical records (June 1993-December 2007) of horses evaluated for abnormal respiratory noise and/or poor performance after laryngoplasty were reviewed. Horses with video recordings of resting and exercising upper airway endoscopy were included and postsurgical abduction categorized. Horses with immediate postoperative endoscopy recordings were also evaluated and postsurgical abduction categorized. Relationships between resting postsurgical abduction and historical information with exercising endoscopic findings were examined. Results: Dynamic collapse of the left arytenoid cartilage was probable in horses with no postsurgical abduction and could not be predicted in horses with grade 3 or 4 postsurgical abduction. Respiratory noise was associated with upper airway obstruction but was not specific for arytenoid collapse. Most horses with a left vocal fold had billowing of the fold during exercise. Other forms of dynamic collapse involved the right vocal fold, aryepiglottic folds, corniculate process of left arytenoid cartilage, dorsal displacement of soft palate, and pharyngeal collapse. Complex obstructions were observed in most examinations and in all horses with exercising collapse of the left arytenoid cartilage. Conclusions: There was no relationship between exercising collapse of the left arytenoid cartilage and grade 3 or 4 postsurgical abduction but was likely in horses with no abduction.",0,0

A technique for solving our most difficult cases evolved after all current methods had been tried.

Existing techniques are also discussed.",0,0
21707828,Pilot study to determine the utility of point-of-care ultrasound in the assessment of difficult laryngoscopy,"Objectives: Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in emergency care settings is challenging. The preintubation clinical screening tests may not be applied in a large number of emergency intubations due to the patient's clinical condition. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the utility of sonographic measurements of thickness of the tongue, anterior neck soft tissue at the level of the hyoid bone, and thyrohyoid membrane in distinguishing difficult and easy laryngoscopies and 2) to examine the association between sonographic measurements (thickness of tongue and anterior neck soft tissue) and difficult airway clinical screening tests (modified Mallampati score, thyromental distance, and interincisor gap). Methods: This was a prospective observational study at an academic medical center. Adult patients undergoing endotracheal intubation for an elective surgical procedure were included. The investigators involved in data collection were blinded to each other's assessments. Demographic variables were collected preoperatively. The clinical screening tests to predict a difficult airway were performed. The ultrasound (US) measurements of tongue and anterior neck soft tissue were obtained. The laryngoscopic view was graded using Cormack and Lehane classification by anesthesia providers on the day of surgery. To allow for comparisons between difficult airway and easy airway groups, a two-sided Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test were employed as appropriate. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to examine the association between screening tests and sonographic measurements. Results: The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) age of 51 eligible patients (32 female, 19 male) was 53.1 (±13.2) years. Six of the 51 patients (12%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3% to 20%) were classified as having difficult laryngoscopy by anesthesia providers. The distribution of laryngoscopy grades for all subjects was 63, 25, 4, and 8% for grades 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In this study, 83% of subjects with difficult airways were males. No other significant differences were noted in the demographic variables and difficult airway clinical screening tests between the two groups. The sonographic measurements of anterior neck soft tissue were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group compared to the easy laryngoscopy group at the level of the hyoid bone (1.69, 95% CI = 1.19 to 2.19 vs. 1.37, 95% CI = 1.27 to 1.46) and thyrohyoid membrane (3.47, 95% CI = 2.88 to 4.07 vs. 2.37, 95% CI = 2.29 to 2.44). No significant correlation was found between sonographic measurements and clinical screening tests. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that sonographic measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at the level of hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane can be used to distinguish difficult and easy laryngoscopies. Clinical screening tests did not correlate with US measurements, and US was able to detect difficult laryngoscopy, indicating the limitations of the conventional screening tests for predicting difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
19256698,Endoscopic narrow-band imaging-quantitative assessment of airway vascularity after lung transplantation,"In lung transplant recipients, the submucosal vascular plexus of the airway wall potentially represents one of the key structures of graft injury. Narrow band imaging is a novel endoscope technique that allows visual enhancement of the mucosa vasculature. It was our aim to investigate the ability of narrow-band imaging in combination with computerized image analysis to quantitatively assess airway vascularity in lung transplant recipients. In consecutive lung transplant recipients, in addition to the routine procedures, optical analysis of the main carina (autologous tissue) and the upper lobe carina (allogeneic tissue) were performed. From every site, three representative pictures were chosen. A total of 63 bronchoscopies were analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (measure for test-retest reliability) of the three measurements were 0.69 and 0.74 for the main carina and the upper lobe carina, respectively. A mixed linear regression revealed increased vascularity in autologous tissue of patients with cystic fibrosis (p=0.06) and decreased vascularity in allogeneic tissue with time after transplantation (p=0.09). Endoscopic narrow-band imaging (NBI) in combination with computerized image analysis allows consistent assessment of airway vascularity in vivo. In lung transplant recipients, there might be differences in airway vascularity in both autologous and allogeneic large airways.",0,0
1415319,"Comparison of four methods for assessing airway bacteriology in intubated, mechanically ventilated patients","A prospective evaluation of lower airway bacteriology from intubated, mechanically ventilated patients was performed by comparing the qualitative and quantitative recovery of bacteria using four different techniques. Twelve intubated, mechanically ventilated patients who satisfied accepted clinical criteria for the suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia were studied. Airway secretions were obtained from each patient by: (1) blind endotracheal aspiration (ET); (2) Accu-cath pulmonary culture catheter (Accu); (3) bronchoscopic protected specimen brush (BPSB); and (4) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). ET specimens were cultured semi-quantitatively (1+ to 4+) aerobically, and all other specimens were cultured quantitatively both aerobically and anaerobically. The BPSB recovered 9 organisms in > or = 10(3) colony forming units/ml, a standard number often used to indicate significant growth. Of these 9 organisms, 7 were recovered at > or = 10(3) cfu/ml by Accu, and 6 were recovered at > or = 10(4) cfu/ml by BAL. All 8 aerobic isolates recovered in > or = 10(3) cfu/ml by BPSB also were recovered by ET aspirate. Five of these were recovered in > or = 3+ semi-quantitative growth by ET aspirate. Of 30 organisms recovered in < 3+ semi-quantitative growth by ET aspirate, 28 were recovered in < 10(3) cfu/ml by BPSB, indicating a negative predictive value of 93%. Thus, it appears that these four methods provide reasonably similar qualitative and quantitative recovery of bacteria from the lower airways of intubated, mechanically ventilated patients. In addition, routine Gram's stain and semi-quantitative aerobic culture of endotracheal aspirate may provide useful information in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.",0,0
6507827,Difficult tracheal intubation in obstetrics,"Difficult intubation has been classified into four grades, according to the view obtainable at laryngoscopy. Frequency analysis suggests that, in obstetrics, the main cause of trouble is grade 3, in which the epiglottis can be seen, but not the cords. This group is fairly rare so that a proportion of anaesthetists will not meet the problem in their first few years and may thus be unprepared for it in obstetrics. However the problem can be simulated in routine anaesthesia, so that a drill for managing it can be practised. Laryngoscopy is carried out as usual, then the blade is lowered so that the epiglottis descends and hides the cords. Intubation has to be done blind, using the Macintosh method. This can be helpful as part of the training before starting in the maternity department, supplementing the Aberdeen drill.",0,0
12826556,Dexmedetomidine and low-dose ketamine provide adequate sedation for awake fibreoptic intubation,"Purpose: We report the use of the alpha2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, with low-dose ketamine as a safe and effective treatment strategy to provide adequate comfort and sedation for a patient who fulfilled criteria of a difficult airway and required awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI). Clinical features: A 52-yr-old male with prostate cancer presented for radical prostatectomy. He reported several failed intubations with previous surgeries and airway examination was consistent with a difficult intubation. In addition, previous fibreoptic intubations were unsuccessful. The patient reported extreme apprehension concerning his airway management. The goal of medicating patients for AFOI includes providing comfort and sedation without causing a change in ventilatory status. Dexmedetomidine has a high affinity for the alpha2 receptor and results in sedation without change in ventilatory status. In addition, dexmedetomidine is a potent anti-sialgogue which makes it desirable for cases involved with airway instrumentation. A loading dose of dexmedetomidine followed by a continuous infusion provided comfort and sedation within ten minutes. While bradycardia and hypotension have been reported with dexmedetomidine use, concurrent low-dose ketamine was employed in this case for it's cardiostimulatory properties and no bradycardia and hypotension were noted. The airway was anesthetized with selective nerve blocks and conditions for airway instrumentation were excellent. There was no change in oxygen saturation or ventilatory status during the administration of medications or airway manipulation. The patient was comfortable, sedated and tolerated the procedures well. There was no recall of the procedure. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine and concurrent low-dose ketamine provided sedation and comfort to this patient who required an AFOI.",0,0
20640117,Evaluation of Truview evo2 Laryngoscope In Anticipated Difficult Intubation - A Comparison To Macintosh Laryngoscope,"The aim of the study was to assess and compare laryngoscopic view of Truview evo2 laryngoscope with that of Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with one or more predictors of difficult intubation (PDI). Moreover ease of intubation with Truview evo2 in terms of absolute time requirement was also aimed at. Patients for elective surgery requiring endotracheal intubation were initially assessed for three PDI parameters - modified Mallampati test, thyro-mental distance & Atlanto-occipital (AO) joint extension. Patients with cumulative PDI scores of 2 to 5 (in a scale of 0 to 8) were evaluated for Cormack & Lehane (CL) grading by Macintosh blade after standard induction. Cases with CL grade of two or more were further evaluated by Truview evo2 laryngoscope and corresponding CL grades were assigned. Intubation attempted under Truview evo2 vision and time required for each successful tracheal intubation (i.e. tracheal intubation completed within one minute) was noted. Total fifty cases were studied. The CL grades assigned by Macintosh blade correlated well with the cumulative PDI scores assigned preoperatively, confirming there predictability. Truview evo2 improved laryngeal view in 92 % cases by one or more CL grade. Intubation with Truview evo2 was possible in 88% cases within stipulated time of one minute and mean time of 28.6 seconds with SD of 11.23 was reasonably quick. No significant complication like oro- pharyngeal trauma or extreme pressor response to laryngoscopy was noticed. To conclude, Truview evo2 proved to be a better tool than conventional laryngoscope in anticipated difficult situations.",0,0
25470888,A comparison of the effects of lidocaine or magnesium sulfate on hemodynamic response and QT dispersion related with intubation in patients with hypertension,"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of magnesium administered before induction on the hemodynamic response and QT dispersion (QTd) related with intubation in hypertensive patients and to compare it with lidocaine. Methods: Patients with essential hypertension who were under ≤ 65 years old, scheduled for elective surgery with a Mallampati score of I-II were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups; group M (n = 20) received magnesium sulfate, group L was prescribed lidocaine, and group C (control group) received saline. Standard 12-lead ECG readings were taken before the induction of anesthesia and at the first and fifth minutes following intubation. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of age, sex and demographic characteristics. There was no significant difference in the QT interval values before induction and 5 minutes after intubation in all groups. In group M, QTd values were significantly lower at the first and fifth minutes than before induction. There were no statistically significant differences in QTd values at different times in group L and group C. Conclusion: QTd is not increased during tracheal intubation in hypertensive patients so there is no need for magnesium sulfate for these patients. But as QTd has been shown to increase during tracheal intubation for coronary artery disease patients, magnesium sulfate might be useful for those patients although future studies are required to confirm this statement.",0,0
25298711,Evaluation of intubating conditions using stylet by conventional through-tube technique and through Murphy's eye in patients with high Mallampati scores,"Background: Difficult intubation is always a nightmare for an Anaesthetist. This study was planned to study the alternative method of stylet use during difficult oro-tracheal intubation. Outcome measures assessed were ease of intubation, hemodynamic stability and reducing complications. Materials and methods: A cohort of 60 patients of Mallampati class III patients was formed and patients were divided into two groups. In group 1 patients, conventional through tube method was used for inserting stylet, whereas, in group 2 patients, Murphy's eye was used for inserting malleable flexi tip stylet. Results: Hemodynamic stability in terms of mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate was observed in group 2. Intubating time, number of attempts of successful intubation and post operative pharyngo-laryngeal complications was also low in group 2 patients. Conclusion: The use of Murphy's eye to pass stylet during difficult airway manoeuvre is a safe alternative over conventional rail-road technique.",0,0
12033092,[Anesthesia induction with sevoflurane in adult patients with predictive signs of difficult intubation],"Objective: This work was carried out to study induction with sevoflurane in adult patients with predictive signs of difficult intubation. Study design: Randomised prospective study. Patients and methods: The study had two parts. Part I: 15 patients without predictive signs of difficult intubation but with a cervical collar. Eight patients were anaesthetised with propofol 3 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl 2 micrograms.kg-1, seven with sevoflurane 8%. Part II: 20 patients with predictive signs of difficult intubation anaesthetised with sevoflurane 8%. Results: In part I, all patients were intubated, the time for intubation was longer with sevoflurane, 6 vs 4 min. They were apneic only in the propofol group. After intubation, 7 cases of coughing (4 severe) occurred in the propofol group and 3 moderate coughing in the sevoflurane group. In part II, one patient experienced considerable agitation after oral airway insertion and was excluded. Other patients were intubated with sevoflurane. Seven patients were intubated with a bougie, three patients through an intubating LMA and one patient with a rigid bronchoscope. The other patients were intubated with a Macintosh blade. The mean time for intubation was 10 +/- 7 min and end tidal sevoflurane concentration after intubation was 4 +/- 0.6%. After intubation, 7 cases of coughing (3 severe) occurred but no desaturation < 95%. No significant haemodynamic variations occurred. Conclusion: Induction with sevoflurane 8% allowed tracheal intubation without major incidents. All patients breathed spontaneously. Sevoflurane can be recommended for induction in cases of predictive difficult intubation.",0,0
19593145,The Simplified Predictive Intubation Difficulty Score: a new weighted score for difficult airway assessment,"Background and objective: Using the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) more than 5 as a standardized definition of difficult intubation, we propose a new score to predict difficult intubation: the Simplified Predictive Intubation Difficulty Score (SPIDS). Methods: We prospectively studied 1024 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia. Using bivariate and multivariable analysis, we established risk factors of difficult intubation. Then, we assigned point values to each of the adjusted risk factors, their sum composing the SPIDS. We assessed its predictive accuracy using sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and compared it with the corresponding nonweighted score. The optimal predictive level of the SPIDS was determined using ROC curve analysis. Results: We found five adjusted risk factors for IDS more than 5: pathological conditions associated with difficult intubation (malformation of the face, acromegaly, cervical rheumatism, tumours of the airway, and diabetes mellitus), mouth opening less than 3.5 cm, a ratio of patient's height to thyromental distance 25 at least, head and neck movement less than 80 degrees , and Mallampati 2 at least. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the SPIDS were 65, 76, 14 and 97%, respectively. AUC of the SPIDS and the nonweighted score (obtained previously using a stepwise logistic regression) were respectively 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.84] and 0.69 (95% CI 0.64-0.73). The threshold for an optimal predictive level of the SPIDS was above 10 of 55. Conclusion: The SPIDS seems easy to perform, and by weighting risk factors of difficult intubation, it could help anaesthesiologists to plan a difficult airway management strategy. A value of SPIDS strictly above 10 could encourage the anaesthesiologists to plan for the beginning of the anaesthetic induction with 'alternative' airway devices ready in the operating theatre.",0,0
10958088,Predicting difficult intubation: a multivariable analysis,"Purpose: To develop a clinically useful and valid model for predicting difficult laryngoscopic tracheal intubation in patients with seemingly normal airways by adhering to the principles of multivariable model development. Methods: This was an observational study performed at a tertiary-care teaching hospital. Preoperatively, 444 randomly selected patients requiring tracheal intubation for elective surgery were assessed. In addition, 27 patients in whom tracheal intubation was difficult, but were not assessed preoperatively, were assessed postoperatively. One assessor, blinded to the intubation information, collected the predictor variables. A reliable definition for difficult intubation was used and all attempts were made to eliminate sources of bias. Multivariable modeling was performed using logistic regression and the model was validated using the bootstrapping technique. Results: Of the 461 patients included in the analysis, 38 were classified as difficult to intubate. Multivariable analysis identified three airway tests that were highly significant for predicting difficult tracheal intubation. These were: 1) ""mouth opening"", 2) ""chin protrusion"", and 3) ""atlanto-occipital extension"". Using these tests, a validated, highly reliable and predictive model is produced to determine the probability of difficult intubation for patients. At a selected probability cut-off value, the model is 86.8% sensitive and 96.0% specific. Conclusion: A simple and accurate multivariable model, consisting of three airway tests, is produced for predicting difficult laryngoscopic tracheal intubation. Additional studies will be required to determine the accuracy and feasibility of this model when applied to a large sample of new patients by multiple anesthesiologists.",0,0
1595845,Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy: an assessment of the thyromental distance and Mallampati predictive tests,Two hundred and fifty patients were assessed preoperatively using the Mallampati classification and by measuring their thyromental distances. The ease or difficulty of direct laryngoscopy was assessed at the time of induction of anaesthesia. Retrognathia was seen in 15.6% of patients and the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy without external laryngeal pressure was 8.2%. It was found that both assessments predicted less than two in three difficult laryngoscopies and had high false positive rates. It was found that external laryngeal pressure often improved the view of the glottis in difficult laryngoscopies.,1,1
21344801,"Difficult intubation in the adult patients undergoing oropharygolaryngeal, neck, and maxillofacial procedures: Thai Anesthesia Incident Monitoring Study (Thai AIMS)","Background: Difficult intubation is one of the common anesthetic related complications during the perioperative period. In the patients with pathology or disease involving the oropharyngolarynx, neck, or maxillo-facial region, they might have a potentially higher risk than the general population. Objective: To determine the characteristics and the contributing factors of difficult intubation in the adult patients undergoing oropharyngolaryngeal, neck, and maxillofacial procedures, and the factors minimizing this incidence and the suggested corrective strategies. Material and method: All incident reports of difficult intubation in the adult patients who received general anesthesia for the procedure involving the oropharyngolarynx, neck, and maxillofacial region from the Thai Anesthesia Incident Monitoring Study (Thai AIMS) database were identified. The details of the reports, the contributing factors, the factors those minimizing the incident, and the suggestive corrective strategies were studied. Results: There were 26 (1.3%) incident reports of difficult intubation from the database. This occurred in 35%, 58%, and 15% of the patients with Mallampati class 1-2, thyromental distance equal or more than 5 cm or 3 fingerbreadths, and combined both parameters, respectively. Forty two percent of cases were judged as an unplanned difficult intubation. Twenty-seven, 23, and 19 percent of the patients had tumor or carcinoma at the oropharyngolarynx, deep neck infection, and maxillofacial fracture, respectively. Nearly half of the adverse events accompanied with difficult intubation were desaturation. No immediate fatally and late outcome was reported. Patients' disease/anatomy was the major contributing factor that might relate to the incidence. Previous experience, experienced assistance, and high vigilance were the factors minimizing incidence. Suggestive corrective strategies were guideline practices, additional training, and improved supervision. Conclusion: Carefully preoperative airway assessment and additional attention focused on the pathology or disease were the principle tasks. Algorithms for both anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway as well as alternative airway equipments should be implemented.",0,0
17051989,[Management of anesthesia in patients with the potential for difficult intubation due to ossification of anterior longitudinal ligament (OALL)],"Ossification of anterior longitudinal ligament (OALL) is a disease inducing ossification of the ligamentum longitudinale anterius of the backbone. The esophagus can be compressed by the disease, which also can induce hoarse voice and dysphagia. Furthermore, the trachea can also be compressed. Difficult intubation had been anticipated based on the preoperative evaluation in this case, but the intubation fortunately was not difficult. However, OALL can accompany difficult intubation, and we anesthesiologists must pay attention to the disease.",0,0
20803868,The awake Glidescope intubation: an additional alternative to the difficult intubation,"Background: The incidence of difficult intubations has consistently remained between 8 and 9%. We found a novel approach to the difficult intubation using a Glidescope in the awake spontaneously breathing patient. Methods: In a difficult airway, the same approach for an awake fiberoptic intubation including excellent nerve blocks and sedation can be used with a Glidescope in the same fashion as a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Results: The skill level for the awake Glidescope appears to be less, making it a useful tool for emergency room physicians and critical care physicians when used for awake intubation. It is particularly useful for the patient who fails the airway exam and also has macroglossia. Conclusion: This case report confirms that while not applicable to every patient, the awake Glidescope intubation does add to the previous existing armamentarium in this clinically challenging situation.",0,0
15548916,Diagnostic tools in laryngology,"Purpose of review: Laryngology has become recognized as a subspecialty within the field of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery over the course of the past 30 years. The evolution of laryngology stems primarily from our better understanding of the physiology of vocal production, society's increased reliance on oral communication in industry, and the resultant demand for improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic protocols to enhance vocal performance. The purpose of this review is to describe current advances in diagnostic tools in laryngology that contribute to our understanding of vocal physiology and our ability to improve quality of life as it relates to vocal performance. Recent findings: Diagnostic tools in laryngology allow the clinician the ability to assess the vibratory function of the vocal folds, evaluate laryngeal structure and airway patency, assess glottal and pulmonary airflow, assess the neurologic integrity of the vocal folds, analyze the quality of the voice signal, and assess the degree of functional disability as it relates to laryngeal pathology. Summary: Primary advances in diagnostic laryngology include improvements in laryngoscopy techniques, imaging, electromyography, aerodynamic testing, acoustic analysis, and functional assessment, each of which is improving our ability to understand, diagnose, and treat a wider spectrum of voice, airway, and swallowing disorders.",0,0
8010424,"Assessment of an interactive learning system with ""sensorized"" manikin head for airway management instruction","An interactive, self-study learning system for airway management instruction that utilizes a ""sensorized"" manikin head (Actronics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) was compared to didactic instruction from anesthesiologists during third-year medical student anesthesia rotations. Before students were allowed to participate in airway management on anesthetized patients, they were randomly separated into two groups. One group received instruction from the learning system, and the other group was given a lecture with guided practice on a standard tracheal intubating manikin. Differences between groups were then assessed using 22 separate variables as all students performed actual airway management on patients undergoing general anesthesia. Anesthesia faculty, residents, and nurse anesthetists, blinded to group, served as assessors. There were 48 and 49 students in the didactic instruction and learning system groups, respectively. Beginning experience level of students with respect to airway management was similar between groups before the anesthesia rotations. There were 185 and 188 evaluation forms completed to assess the didactic instruction and learning system groups, respectively. Demographic data regarding patients were recorded. Patients in the learning system group on whom students performed airway management were older, had a larger average body mass index, and their airways more frequently received higher Mallampati classifications (glottic structures more difficult to visualize). No difference in the quality of airway management efforts or in students' appraisal of their own performances was seen between groups. Neither group demonstrated more rapid development of psychomotor skills. Students were equally satisfied with both methods of instruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
22563177,Transparent-cap-fitted colonoscopy shows higher performance with cecal intubation time in difficult cases,"Aim: To investigate the efficacy of cap-fitted colonoscopy (CFC) with regard to cecal intubation time. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-five patients undergoing screening colonoscopy at Gospel Hospital, Kosin University College of Medicine were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial between January and December 2010. Colonoscopies were conducted by a single endoscopist. Patient characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, history of abdominal surgery, quality of preparation, and the presence of diverticulosis were recorded. Results: One hundred and fifty patients were allocated into a CFC group and 145 into a non-CFC (NCF) group. Cecal intubations were achieved in all patients. Cecal intubation time in the CFC group was significantly shorter than in the NCF group for specific conditions: age ≥ 60 years, prior abdominal surgery, and poor bowel preparation. The number of detected adenomas was higher in the CFC group than in the NCF group (P = 0.040). Conclusion: CFC facilitated shortening of the cecal intubation time in difficult cases, and was more sensitive for detecting adenomas than was NCF.",0,0
21346165,The association between obesity and difficult prehospital tracheal intubation,"Background: Nonphysician advanced life support (ALS) providers often perform tracheal intubation (TI) for cardiac arrest or other life-threatening indications in the prehospital setting, where airway assessment and airway management tools are limited. However, the frequency of difficult TI in obese patients in this setting is unclear. In this study we determined factors associated with TI success, and determined TI difficulty as a function of body mass index (BMI) in a system of ALS providers experienced in TI, to guide future prehospital education efforts. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of all patients ≥15 years of age who underwent prehospital TI by paramedics in the Seattle Medic One system over a 4-year period, and were transported to the regional level 1 trauma center (Harborview Medical Center). Data were abstracted from a prospectively collected prehospital airway management database and from the hospital medical records, including demographic information, number of TI attempts, TI success or failure, and body weight/height (BMI). Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were calculated, with the primary end point being difficult TI (defined as ≥4 TI attempts or the need to use an alternative airway management technique). Results: Of 80,501 patient contacts in whom 4114 TIs were attempted during the 4-year study period, 823 met study entry criteria (including a calculable BMI). The overall TI success rate in the study population was 98.5% (811 out of 823), with 6.8% (56 out of 823) meeting the predetermined definition for difficult TI. There was no significant association between difficult TI and patient age, gender, use of succinylcholine, or medical diagnosis (trauma vs. nontrauma). In comparison with the lean patient subgroup (BMI <30 kg/m(2)), patients with class III obesity (BMI >40 kg/m(2)) had a significant association with difficult TI (odds ratio 3.68; confidence interval [CI] 1.27-10.59), whereas those with class I/II obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) and <40 kg/m(2)) did not (odds ratio 0.98; CI 0.46 -2.07). Conclusions: Among prehospital ALS providers with previously documented and published successful TI performance, increased difficulty with TI was observed in patients with extreme obesity, but not in patients with lesser degrees of obesity. Because extreme obesity is an easily identifiable patient characteristic, didactic and clinical (e.g., operating room) airway management education for such providers should emphasize airway management challenges and strategies associated with obesity, including specific equipment, patient positioning, and practice recommendations that may facilitate both TI and alternative airway management techniques in this population.",0,0
10781266,Prediction of difficult mask ventilation,"Background: Maintenance of airway patency and oxygenation are the main objectives of face-mask ventilation. Because the incidence of difficult mask ventilation (DMV) and the factors associated with it are not well known, we undertook this prospective study. Methods: Difficult mask ventilation was defined as the inability of an unassisted anesthesiologist to maintain the measured oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry > 92% or to prevent or reverse signs of inadequate ventilation during positive-pressure mask ventilation under general anesthesia. A univariate analysis was performed to identify potential factors predicting DMV, followed by a multivariate analysis, and odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. Results: A total of 1,502 patients were prospectively included. DMV was reported in 75 patients (5%; 95% confidence interval, 3.9-6.1%), with one case of impossible ventilation. DMV was anticipated by the anesthesiologist in only 13 patients (17% of the DMV cases). Body mass index, age, macroglossia, beard, lack of teeth, history of snoring, increased Mallampati grade, and lower thyromental distance were identified in the univariate analysis as potential DMV risk factors. Using a multivariate analysis, five criteria were recognized as independent factors for a DMV (age older than 55 yr, body mass index > 26 kg/m2, beard, lack of teeth, history of snoring), the presence of two indicating high likelihood of DMV (sensitivity, 0.72; specificity, 0.73). Conclusion: In a general adult population, DMV was reported in 5% of the patients. A simple DMV risk score was established. Being able to more accurately predict DMV may improve the safety of airway management.",1,1
24731921,"Mucopolysaccharidosis: Otolaryngologic findings, obstructive sleep apnea and accumulation of glucosaminoglycans in lymphatic tissue of the upper airway","Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate otolaryngologic problems (upper airway obstruction, obstructive sleep apnea, restriction of mouth opening, middle ear effusion, hearing and breathing problems) and their treatments on mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) patients and to investigate accumulation of glucosaminoglycans (GAG) in the upper airway biochemically and pathologically. Methods: 76 MPS patients were evaluated. Forty-two MPS patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Pre- and postoperative PSG results of 18 patients were compared. The success and complications of treatments for OSA in MPS were evaluated. Biochemical and histopathological accumulation of GAG in tonsil and adenoid tissue and middle ear effusion were analyzed and compared with the control group. Results: Forty patients out of 42 tested with PSG had OSA (95%). Adenoid grade, Mallampati grade, restricted mouth opening, rate of difficult intubation were significantly different among MPS subtypes. MPS types III and IV had significantly lower Mallampati scores; type VI had significantly worse mouth opening; and type III had significantly better mouth opening and higher rate of easy intubation when compared to other MPS types. There was no significant difference between MPS subtypes according to tonsil grade, adenoid grade, rate of otitis media with effusion and OSA severity. Statistically significant difference was found between GAG accumulation in adenoid tissue and middle ear effusion of MPS and control group (p<0.05). However, GAG accumulation in tonsil was not significantly different between MPS and control group. There was a statistically significant improvement in postop Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) compared to preop AHI (p<0.05). Conclusions: Most MPS patients have airway obstruction and OSA due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Most of these children benefit from adenotonsillectomy, after which OSA significantly improves. They experience high recurrence rate after adenoidectomy; though this is not clinically problematic. They also suffer from conductive hearing loss due to OME, which has to be treated with ventilation tube insertion. However, such operations are usually complicated by difficult endotracheal intubation and restricted mouth opening. Sometimes tracheotomy may be necessary. Tracheotomy is also highly complicated in MPS patients. Significant accumulation of GAG in middle ear fluid and adenoid tissue is present; however, GAG appears not to accumulate in tonsillar tissue.",0,0
10395398,Inadequate assessment of the airway and ventilation in acute poisoning. A need for improved education?,"Aims and objectives: To analyse the initial management of acute poisoning patients, and whether respiratory morbidity was related to inadequate assessment of airway and ventilation. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the assessment and resuscitation of a group of acute poisoning patients, as documented in the clinical records. Subjects and setting: Forty one patients admitted to either Intensive Care or Coronary Care Units in a UK teaching hospital with a diagnosis of acute poisoning, between 12 January 1997 and 21 January 1998. Standards: Advanced Life Support Guidelines were used to compare initial assessment. Criteria for intubation and ventilation described by Gentleman was used as the standard for intubation. Results: Thirty seven patients had documented Glasgow Coma Scales at the time of admission, 27 were managed appropriately; one exhibited signs of aspiration. Ten patients were judged to be managed inappropriately; six exhibited clinical signs of aspiration. Four patients had unidentified Glasgow Coma Scales. Conclusions: Increased emphasis on 'Airway and Breathing' remains necessary in medical education. Regional recommendations for the management of acute poisoning require 'intubation guidelines'. Appropriate ward settings for monitoring such patients may pre-empt the onset of major respiratory problems.",0,0

A 64-year-old woman with no history of coronary artery disease underwent Nissen fundoplication under general anesthesia. Preoperatively, an exercise-tolerance test revealed LBBB, without ischemic symptoms. Intraoperatively, the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively, LBBB appeared in the absence of clinical symptoms or physiologic stress. The patient reported several similar episodes previously. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Subsequent electrocardiograms revealed persistence of LBBB. Anesthesiologists should be aware of the possibility of perioperative transient LBBB in the absence of cardiac ischemia.",0,0
22174462,Airway management in trauma,"Trauma has assumed epidemic proportion. 10% of global road accident deaths occur in India. Hypoxia and airway mismanagement are known to contribute up to 34% of pre-hospital deaths in these patients. A high degree of suspicion for actual or impending airway obstruction should be assumed in all trauma patients. Objective signs of airway compromise include agitation, obtundation, cyanosis, abnormal breath sound and deviated trachea. If time permits, one should carry out a brief airway assessment prior to undertaking definitive airway management in these patients. Simple techniques for establishing and maintaining airway patency include jaw thrust maneuver and/or use of oro- and nas-opharyngeal airways. All attempts must be made to perform definitive airway management whenever airway is compromised that is not amenable to simple strategies. The selection of airway device and route- oral or -nasal, for tracheal intubation should be based on nature of patient injury, experience and skill level.",0,0

Design: Prospective crossover study. Setting: University Sport Medicine Clinic. Participants: Sixty-two university varsity football (62 males), 45 ice hockey (26 males and 19 females), and 39 soccer players (20 males, 19 females). Interventions: Athletes were assessed for different airway and physical characteristics. Three different physicians then assessed the use of laryngoscopes of different handle sizes in supine athletes who were wearing protective equipment while in-line cervical spine immobilization was maintained. Main outcome measures: The ease of passage of a laryngoscope blade into the posterior oropharynx of a supine athlete was assessed using both a standard long-handle and a short-handle laryngoscope. Results: Use of a short-handle laryngoscope was easier for all physicians in all sports as compared with a standard-sized laryngoscope. Passage of a laryngoscope blade into the posterior oropharynx of a supine athlete was easiest in soccer players and most difficult in football and ice hockey players for both sizes of laryngoscope. Interference from chest or shoulder pads was a common cause for difficulty in passing the laryngoscope blade into the posterior oropharynx for football and ice hockey players. Conclusions: In the rare instances that an endotracheal intubation is to be attempted on an unconscious athlete, a short-handle laryngoscope may provide the best chance for successful intubation.",0,0
8017596,Large cervical osteophyte--another cause of difficult flexible fibreoptic intubation,A patient suffering from ankylosing spondylitis required surgical excision of a large anterior osteophyte of the cervical spine.

15678506,"Sputum induction in children with difficult asthma: safety, feasibility, and inflammatory cell pattern","Difficult childhood asthma is defined by persistent symptoms despite maximal conventional therapy. We aimed to establish a safe method of sputum induction for these children and to study cytology and the relationship to exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Sputum induction was performed in 38/40 children (aged 6-16 years) with difficult asthma, using 3.5% saline for four 5-min periods after bronchodilator pretreatment. Two children were excluded from sputum induction because postbronchodilator forced expired volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) was <65% predicted. Seven of 38 children had symptoms (dyspnea and wheezing) during induction; of these, 3 experienced a fall in FEV(1) of >20% from postbronchodilator FEV(1), readily reversed with salbutamol. Sputum induction was successful in 28/38 children, with a higher success rate in children >/= 12 years than in younger children (87% vs. 50%, P = 0.02). Only 9/28 had abnormal sputum cytology; of these, 6 had predominant sputum eosinophilia (>2.5% eosinophils, </=54% neutrophils), while 3 had sputum neutrophilia (</=2.5% eosinophils, >54% neutrophils). Of 23 children with elevated eNO values, only 6 had sputum eosinophilia. In conclusion, sputum induction can be used to assess airway inflammation in children with difficult asthma, but abnormal sputum cytology is only present in a minority. Raised nitric oxide is only poorly predictive of sputum eosinophilia in these children.",0,0
22284313,"Laryngoscopy in conscious patients with remifentanil: how useful is an ""awake look""?","Study objective: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of direct laryngoscopy in the conscious patient as a diagnostic test for difficult direct laryngoscopy in the unconscious patient. Design: Prospective case series. Setting: Various operating rooms in a Canadian tertiary-care hospital. Patients: 81 ASA physical status 1, 2, and 3 subjects undergoing elective surgery. Interventions: A bolus of midazolam was given and a continuous infusion of remifentanil was started and adjusted as needed. Direct laryngoscopy was performed in the conscious subject. No topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. Measurements: The modified Cormack-Lehane grade was recorded with each subject conscious and unconscious. Other data collected before the intervention included age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, Mallampati class, thyromental distance, mouth opening, previous history of failed or difficult intubation, history of hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea, and routine use of beta blockers. The time of intravenous placement, total dose and duration of remifentanil infusion, and time of endotracheal tube placement were recorded. The lowest oxygen saturation, lowest and highest systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and presence or absence of gagging, coughing, or chest wall rigidity were also noted. Subjects were also asked to complete a questionnaire in the recovery room regarding recall and the degree of discomfort experienced. Main results: 43 of 81 subjects were graded 1 or 2a when the laryngoscopy was done in the conscious subject. Six of the 38 subjects who were graded as a difficult laryngoscopy (grade 2b or higher) when they were conscious also remained a difficult laryngoscopy when unconscious and paralyzed. Sensitivity and specificity of direct laryngoscopy in the conscious subject as a diagnostic test for difficult direct laryngoscopy in the unconscious subject were 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1] and 57% (95% CI 0.47 to 0.70), respectively. Conclusions: Using remifentanil as the sole analgesic allows evaluation of the larynx with direct laryngoscopy in a conscious patient. A poor Cormack-Lehane grade in a conscious patient may or may not improve with general anesthesia.",0,0
875433,Inhalation of foreign bodies in children. Report of 500 cases,"Inhalation of foreign bodies is a major cause of accidental death during childhood. Aspiration of foreign bodies is common in children aged 1 to 3 years, especially in boys. A past history of foreign body aspiration is itself an indication for bronchoscopic examination of the airways, because some children with aspirated foreign bodies are without symptoms and chest x-ray films may not show abnormalities. Bronchoscopic removal of the foreign bodies requires close communication between the anesthesiologist and the endoscopist. Forgotten foreign bodies in the airways cause chronic pulmonary infections, allergic asthma, bronchiectatic changes, and lung abscess. Foreign bodies that cannot be grasped by bronchoscopic forceps should be removed by thoracotomy and bronchotomy. This report describes our experience in 500 children with suspected foreign body inhalation. We routinely use prednisolone, 1 to 2 mg. per kilogram, and nebulization just after bronchoscopic examination of the airways. This medication greatly diminishes the rate of postbronchoscopic complications such as laryngeal edema, which require tracheostomy. In our series of 500 case, the incidence of postbronchoscopic tracheostomy is 1.4 per cent and the total mortality rate is 1.8 per cent.",0,0
23233395,Review article: video-laryngoscopy: another tool for difficult intubation or a new paradigm in airway management?,"Background: An adequate airway management plan is essential for patient safety. Recently, new tools have been developed as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy and intubation. Among these, video-laryngoscopy has enjoyed a rapid increase in popularity and is now considered by many as the first-line technique in airway management. This paradigm shift may have an impact on patient safety. Principal findings: Studies show that video-laryngoscopes are associated with better glottic visualization, a higher success rate for difficult airways, and a faster learning curve, resulting in a higher success rate for intubations by novice physicians. Thus, unanticipated difficult intubations may be less frequent if video-laryngoscopy is used as the first-line approach. In addition, on-screen viewing by the operator creates a new dynamic interaction during airway management. The entire operating room team can assess progress in real time, which enhances communication and improves teaching. However, if video-laryngoscopes become standard tools for tracheal intubation, these more costly devices will need to be widely available in all locations where airway management is conducted. Furthermore, algorithms for difficult intubation will require modification, and the question of selecting alternate devices will arise. If the incidence of difficult intubation decreases, the lack of motivation to teach and learn the use of alternative devices might adversely impact patient safety. Conclusion: The greater effectiveness of video-laryngoscopes associated with multi-person visualization could enhance overall patient safety during airway management. However, the routine use of video-laryngoscopy also introduces some issues that need to be addressed to avoid potentially dangerous pitfalls.",0,0
27051376,Is it time for routine use of the retromolar fiberscope?,"Purpose: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness, safety, and oral intubation time (IT) using a retromolar Bonfils fiberoptic scope compared with a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope. Materials and methods: Sixty patients (16-60 years old, American Society of Anesthesiology I/II) scheduled for general anesthesia for elective ear-nose-throat and plastic surgery were randomly divided into a Bonfils group (Group B, n = 30) and a Macintosh group (Group M, n = 30). Exclusion criteria included Mallampati IV, thyromental distance ≤4 cm, mouth <4 cm, cervical spine problems, body mass index >35, sleep apnea, reflux esophagitis, coronary artery disease, intracranial vascular malformation, elevated intracranial pressure, bleeding disorders, allergies to planned drugs, and patient refusal. Mallampati scoring, mouth opening, and thyromental distance were used for airway assessment. The time needed for successful intubation (IT), number of attempts, number of failures, systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR) and Oxygen saturation (O2) and damage to the lips, dentures, and pharyngeal or laryngeal structures were recorded. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentage. Chi-square tests and Student's t-tests were used to compare the groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The groups were comparable regarding demographic data, preoperative airway parameters, IT, the number of attempts, O2, and the incidence of complications (P > 0.05). However, Bonfils intubation was associated with more stable HR, SBP, DBP and MBP (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The Bonfils fiberoptic scope is comparable to a Macintosh laryngoscope but assures better hemodynamic stability. In difficult cases, the Bonfils scope is a better choice because of its ability to navigate.",0,0
7605845,[Unexpectedly difficult intubation: fiberoptic endotracheal intubation with the laryngeal mask],"A 67-year old patient, scheduled for elective transvesical resection of the prostate gland, presented intubation problems. Fibreoptic assessment of the larynx revealed secretions as well as a swollen laryngeal mucosa; endotracheal intubation guided by the fibreoptic bronchoscope was not possible. After multiple attempts to intubate the trachea a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Endotracheal intubation was completed by guidance of the fibreoptic bronchoscope via the laryngeal mask airway. After surgery the patient was transferred to an ICU and ventilated for one day. Fibreoptically controlled extubation was uneventful. Management of the unexpectedly difficult intubation is a challenge for every anaesthetist. The laryngeal mask airway, a relatively new device for airway protection, has proved to be beneficial in planned as well as in unexpectedly difficult endotracheal intubation. However, although the laryngeal mask airway may solve ventilation problems initially, prelaryngeal alterations present a contraindication for perioperative ventilation via the laryngeal mask airway. The fibreoptic intubation through the laryngeal mask airway is an important technique to consider in the ""cannot intubate"" situation.",0,0
21415194,EXIT procedure: technique and indications with prenatal imaging parameters for assessment of airway patency,"Successful management of fetal conditions in which airway obstruction is anticipated is now possible because of advances in prenatal imaging and the development of innovative techniques to secure the fetal airway before complete separation of the fetus from the maternal circulation. Fetal ultrasonography and fetal magnetic resonance imaging are complementary imaging modalities in the assessment of fetuses with potential airway obstruction. The ex utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT) procedure is used to secure the fetal airway before complete delivery of the fetus. However, successful intrapartum treatment of fetuses who may need prolonged placental support depends on a multidisciplinary assessment in which the benefits of the EXIT procedure for the fetus are weighed against the risk of maternal complications that may occur during prolongation of the intrapartum period to secure the fetal airway. This multidisciplinary approach requires an understanding of the types of lesions in which intrapartum fetal airway access would be beneficial, a knowledge of the prenatal images that would best delineate the anatomic defect and thus help guide the best approach to securing the airway, and consensus and coordination among medical ethicists, radiologists, obstetric anesthesiologists and obstetricians, pediatric surgeons and anesthesiologists, and neonatologists.",0,0
22333883,Parametrically adjustable intubation mannequin with real-time visual feedback,"Introduction: Training for direct laryngoscopy relies heavily on practice with patients. The necessity for human practice might be supplanted to some extent by an intubation mannequin with accurate airway anatomy, a realistic ""feel"" during laryngoscopy, the capacity to model many patient configurations, and a means to provide feedback to trainees and instructors. The goals of this project were (1) to build and evaluate an airway simulator with realistic dimensions and haptic sensation that could undergo a range of adjustments in several features that affect laryngoscopy difficulty and (2) to develop a system for displaying information on laryngoscopy force and motion in real time. Methods: The prototype was an existing 2-dimensional (2D) airway model that closely approximated cephalometric measurements of head, neck, and airway anatomy from the dental and surgical literature. The 2D model was extended in a third dimension by adding layers along the coronal axis. An off-the-shelf airway model provided the tongue, pharynx, larynx, and trachea. Adjustability was built into the face, jaw, mouth, teeth, and spine components. A feedback system was constructed with a force- and motion-sensing laryngoscope and motion sensors incorporated in the mannequin head, jaw, and larynx. Anatomic accuracy was assessed by measuring model dimensions. Realism was evaluated by measuring laryngoscopy force and motion compared with laryngoscopy in patients. Results: The extruded 2.5-dimensional model maintained a close conformity to the anatomic measurements present in the original 2D model. The model could be adjusted through multiple settings for face length, jaw length and tension, mouth opening, and dental condition. The laryngoscopy trajectory had a similar shape to laryngoscopy trajectories in patients, but force was greater, on the order of 50 N, compared with roughly 30 N in patients. The movement of the laryngoscope through the mannequin airway could be displayed in real time during the procedure, establishing a means for feedback. Conclusions: The model incorporates novel features that could aid in developing mastery of the laryngoscopy procedure. Further work is needed to investigate how adjustability and feedback impact the value of laryngoscopy practice on mannequins.",0,0
16229699,Airway rescue in acute upper airway obstruction using a ProSeal Laryngeal mask airway and an Aintree catheter: a review of the ProSeal Laryngeal mask airway in the management of the difficult airway,"We report the successful use of a ProSeal Laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) to rescue the airway when emergency tracheal intubation and ventilation of the lungs were impossible after haemorrhage into the neck following carotid endarterectomy, despite evacuation of the clot. The airway was re-established after placement of a PLMA. Fibreoptic examination of the airway revealed severe supraglottic swelling compromising airway patency. An Aintree catheter was placed in the trachea under fibreoptic guidance and a tracheal tube railroaded over this. The use of the PLMA in seven cases of difficult airway management and 11 cases of airway rescue is reviewed. Use of the PLMA was associated with high levels of success, often rescuing the airway when other techniques had failed. No complications of use of the PLMA were reported in these cases. The PLMA appears to be a useful device to assist in management of the difficult airway and for airway rescue. Potential advantages over the classic laryngeal mask airway include improved airway seal and reduced risk of aspiration. The gum elastic bougie-guided insertion technique is recommended when the PLMA is used for airway rescue.",0,0
2178643,Simulation technique for difficult intubation: teaching tool or new hazard?,"This investigation evaluated the risks of a simulation drill designed to improve the skill of anesthesia personnel in dealing with an unexpected difficult intubation. In a controlled prospective study, 40 patients with normal airways scheduled to undergo noncardiothoracic surgery were randomized into two groups of 20 patients. In the control group, intubation was performed by standard techniques. In the simulation group, intubation of a difficult airway was simulated and performed with the aid of an endotracheal tube introducer. Heart rate (HR); systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures (BPs); and arterial oxygen saturation were measured noninvasively during the preinduction period and 1 minute postintubation. A record was kept of all adverse events, including electrocardiogram (EKG) evidence of myocardial ischemia or cardiac arrhythmias, esophageal intubation, pulmonary aspiration, or tracheal injury. There were no significant differences in percent changes in HR, BP, or oxygen saturation between the two groups. There were five uncomplicated esophageal intubations in the simulation group compared with none in the control group (p = 0.001). No other adverse events were recorded. The potential hazards of esophageal intubation should be considered before this simulation drill is performed.",0,0
23174918,Mallampati class does not affect the success rate of intubation through an intubating laryngeal mask airway with reverse tracheal tube direction,"Background: The aim of this paper was to assess whether the Mallampati class can affect the success rate of intubation through an intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) with a reverse conventional tracheal tube direction. Methods: Two-hundred ASA I-II adults, 100 patients with Mallampati class 1 or 2 (MP12) and 100 with Mallampati class 3 or 4 (MP34) undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. All the patients were intubated through the ILMA with a reverse conventional tracheal tube direction. Tracheal intubation was considered successful if proper tracheal positioning was attained within three attempts. Chi-Square analysis was used to compare categorical variables between the two groups. Results: Tracheal intubation was successful in 186 of 200 patients (93.0%): 169 (84.5%) at the first attempt. Fourteen (7.0%) had to be intubated using direct laryngoscope. Both the first attempt success rate and overall success rate were similar between the MP12 and MP34 groups (84.0 vs. 85.0%, P=0.845 and 93.0 vs. 93.0%, respectively). Conclusion: Tracheal intubation was successful in 93.0% of patients through an ILMA with a reverse conventional tracheal tube. Mallampati class did not affect the success rate of intubation.",0,0
22575604,Use of the CTrach Laryngeal Mask Airway in adult patients: a retrospective review of 126 cases,"Study objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the CTrach Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) when used electively. Design: Retrospective analysis. Setting: Operating room of an academic hospital. Measurements: Data from 126 patients who were electively intubated with the CTrach LMA over a 16-month period were reviewed. Each patient's weight, height, ASA physical status classification, Mallampati score, thyromental distance, and cervical spine range of motion were recorded. Main results: Successful ventilation was achieved in 100% of patients, while successful intubation was achieved in 89.7% of patients. The most common reason for failure to intubate was poor airway visualization and the inability to appropriately position the device anterior to the vocal cords. Conclusions: The major advantage of the CTrach LMA is that it is the only device that allows airway visualization during patient ventilation; however, it does not have 100% success with intubation.",0,0

22340331,A pilot study of the effect of pressure-driven lidocaine spray on airway topical anesthesia for conscious sedation intubation,"Background: Difficult airway remains not only a challenge to the anesthesiologists, but also a life-threatening event to the patients. Awake intubation is the principal choice to deal with difficult airway, and a key point for awake intubation is airway topical anesthesia. Yet, so far there is no ideal topical anesthesia approach for awake intubation. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of pressure-driven (by 10 L/min oxygen flow) lidocaine spray on airway topical anesthesia in order to find a powerful and convenient method for airway topical anesthesia for conscious sedation intubation. Methods: Thirty adult patients referred for elective surgery under general anesthesia, aged 18 - C60 years and Mallampati class I or II, were recruited for the study. Before topical anesthesia, the observer's assessment of alert and sedation (OAA/S) scale was controlled between 3 and 4 by intravenous midazolam (0.03 mg/kg), propofol (2 mg×kg(-1)×h(-1)) and remifentanil (0.05 µg×kg(-1)×min(-1)). Ten minutes after sedation, topical anesthesia was performed with the pressure-driven lidocaine spray; the driving pressure was achieved by an oxygen flow of 10 L/min. After topical anesthesia, tracheal intubation was performed and the intubation condition was assessed with modified the Erhan's intubation condition score by an experienced anesthesiologist, and a score of less than 10 was considered to be satisfactory. Attempts to intubate the patient were recorded, and the complications such as local anesthetic toxicity, mucosa injury, and respiration depression were also recorded. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded at different time points before and after intubation. Patients were asked 24 hours after the operation whether they could recall the events during intubation. Results: All patients were intubated at the first attempt, the average intubation condition score was 7.0 ± 1.1, from 6 to 10, satisfied intubation condition. MAP and HR increased significantly but mildly immediately after the tracheal intubation (P < 0.05), and decreased to the pre-intubation level soon after intubation. There were no related complications and patients had no recall of the intubation procedures. Conclusions: Topical anesthesia with pressure driven 2% lidocaine spray, where pressure is achieved by 10 L/min oxygen flow, can offer satisfactory intubation conditions for conscious sedation intubation.",0,0
14698367,Anesthesia induction for a difficult intubation infant with a laryngeal cyst,"We report a case of difficult airway in a 37-day-old female with a laryngeal cyst during induction of general anesthesia. This case illustrates that upper airway obstruction can occur during induction of anesthesia with an unusual infantile aryepiglottic fold cyst. In this case, successful orotracheal intubation was achieved with spontaneous respiration, and preoperative information on orientation of the lesion assisted in positioning the patient to minimize the degree of dynamic obstruction.",0,0
24229430,Successful nasal intubation with a laryngeal nerve monitoring tube using bronchoscopy in a patient with plunging goiter: a case report,"Background: The appropriate positioning of nerve integrity monitoring during thyroid surgery is of relevance. In this case report we describe our experience with accurate placement of a nerve integrity monitoring endotracheal tube, obtained by fiberoptic control, in a patient with expected difficult airway management. Case presentation: We report the case of a 70-year-old obese woman scheduled for elective total thyroidectomy due to plunging intrathoracic goiter. The preoperative indirect laryngoscopy pointed out a massive bombè of the hypopharyngeal wall to the right and right vocal cord paralysis. The epiglottis was oedematous and the glottis could not be identified. On physical examination, the tongue was large and a Mallampati's score of 3 was determined. Hence, due to an expected difficult airway management, a nasal intubation with an electromyographic nerve integrity monitoring endotracheal tube trough fiberoptic bronchoscopy was successfully performed. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that nasal intubation can be safely performed by using a nerve integrity monitoring tube with the help of fiberoptic bronchoscopy.",0,0

8797432,Analysis of the safety of bronchoscopy after recent acute myocardial infarction,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is generally considered to increase the risk of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). Currently, to our knowledge, no data in the literature support or challenge this concept. We conducted a retrospective chart review for the years 1986 to 1994 of 20 patients (14 men) who underwent 21 FFBs while hospitalized for an AMI. The mean age was 63.8 years (range, 38 to 83 years). Ten patients underwent revascularization procedures (eight coronary artery bypass grafting and two percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) before FFB. The mean period between the AMI and FFB was 11.7 days (range, 1 to 30 days). Indications for FFB were pulmonary infiltrate (n = 10), hemoptysis (n = 6), atelectasis (n = 4), and to localize a suspected bronchopleural fistula (n = 1). Procedures performed included airway examination (21), BAL (12), transbronchial biopsy (2), endobronchial biopsy (3), and endobronchial brushing (4). No procedure was interrupted as a result of an adverse event, and five patients died during the same hospitalization. Four of the deaths occurred 6 to 15 days postprocedure; 1 patient (who had active ischemia at the time of FFB) died 4 h postprocedure. We conclude that FFB is safe in the immediate post-AMI period as long as the patient does not have active ischemia at the time of the procedure.",0,0
21892258,Endotracheal intubation skill acquisition by medical students,"Background: During the course of their training, medical students may receive introductory experience with advanced resuscitation skills. Endotracheal intubation (ETI--the insertion of a breathing tube into the trachea) is an example of an important advanced resuscitation intervention. Only limited data characterize clinical ETI skill acquisition by medical students. We sought to characterize medical student acquisition of ETI procedural skill. Methods: The study included third-year medical students participating in a required anesthesiology clerkship. Students performed ETI on operating room patients under the supervision of attending anesthesiologists. Students reported clinical details of each ETI effort, including patient age, sex, Mallampati score, number of direct laryngoscopies and ETI success. Using mixed-effects regression, we characterized the adjusted association between ETI success and cumulative ETI experience. Results: ETI was attempted by 178 students on 1,646 patients (range 1-23 patients per student; median 9 patients per student, IQR 6-12). Overall ETI success was 75.0% (95% CI 72.9-77.1%). Adjusted for patient age, sex, Mallampati score and number of laryngoscopies, the odds of ETI success improved with cumulative ETI encounters (odds ratio 1.09 per additional ETI encounter; 95% CI 1.04-1.14). Students required at least 17 ETI encounters to achieve 90% predicted ETI success. Conclusions: In this series medical student ETI proficiency was associated with cumulative clinical procedural experience. Clinical experience may provide a viable strategy for fostering medical student procedural skills.",0,0
2684442,Difficult intubation in the parturient,"Difficult or failed tracheal intubation is an important cause of anaesthetic-related maternal morbidity and mortality. The incidence of failed intubation in parturients is estimated to be as frequent as 1 in 500; that of mortality is unknown, although some 10-13 pregnant women in England, Scotland and Wales die each year because of anaesthetic-related complications. To prevent such catastrophes, all necessary monitors and equipment should be available, including that needed to deal with a failed intubation. Assessment of the patient may lead to preoperative recognition of a difficult airway; altered positioning may be of help both in recognition and management. Furthermore, adequate assistance, correct use of cricoid pressure, and confirmation of tracheal intubation are fundamental to safe practice. Lastly, should the anaesthetist fail to intubate the patient's trachea, a management protocol is suggested.",0,0

19216776,Comparison of the Airtraq and Truview laryngoscopes to the Macintosh laryngoscope for use by Advanced Paramedics in easy and simulated difficult intubation in manikins,"Background: Paramedics are frequently required to perform tracheal intubation, a potentially life-saving manoeuvre in severely ill patients, in the prehospital setting. However, direct laryngoscopy is often more difficult in this environment, and failed tracheal intubation constitutes an important cause of morbidity. Novel indirect laryngoscopes, such as the Airtraq and Truview laryngoscopes may reduce this risk. Methods: We compared the efficacy of these devices to the Macintosh laryngoscope when used by 21 Paramedics proficient in direct laryngoscopy, in a randomized, controlled, manikin study. Following brief didactic instruction with the Airtraq and Truview laryngoscopes, each participant took turns performing laryngoscopy and intubation with each device, in an easy intubation scenario and following placement of a hard cervical collar, in a SimMan manikin. Results: The Airtraq reduced the number of optimization manoeuvres and reduced the potential for dental trauma when compared to the Macintosh, in both the normal and simulated difficult intubation scenarios. In contrast, the Truview increased the duration of intubation attempts, and required a greater number of optimization manoeuvres, compared to both the Macintosh and Airtraq devices. Conclusion: The Airtraq laryngoscope performed more favourably than the Macintosh and Truview devices when used by Paramedics in this manikin study. Further studies are required to extend these findings to the clinical setting.",0,0
19685133,The videolaryngoscope is less traumatic than the classic laryngoscope for a difficult airway in an obese patient,"This report describes the anesthetic management of an obese patient with a difficult airway and the merits of videolaryngoscopy, specifically in terms of the reduced risk of dental damage during intubation. A 49-year-old woman (body mass index; BMI, 36 kg.m(-2)), was scheduled to undergo an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of cholelithiasis. Based upon the obesity of the patient and preoperative metrics (Mallampati grade IV; interdental distance of 2.9 cm; thyromental distance, 5.5 cm) a difficult airway was anticipated. Classic direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh blade size IV failed, despite three intubation attempts-each resulting in a Cormack-Lehane grade IV view. Intubation using a video-assisted Macintosh laryngoscope (V-Mac; Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was successful upon the first attempt. The maximum force exerted on the patient's maxillary incisors was 61 N by direct laryngoscopy and 7.6 N using the indirect videolaryngoscope, both using a Macintosh blade.",0,0
24435879,Incidence and predictors of difficult nasotracheal intubation with airway scope,"Purpose: The airway scope (AWS) improves views of the larynx during orotracheal intubation. However, the role of the AWS in routine nasotracheal intubation has not been studied adequately. Methods: One hundred and three patients undergoing dental and maxillofacial surgery that required general anesthesia and nasotracheal intubation were enrolled. The study was approved by our Institution Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. We evaluated the success rate of AWS intubation and the incidence of difficult nasotracheal intubation using a modified intubation difficulty scale (IDS) to examine preoperative characteristics and intubation profiles. Categories were difficult intubation (IDS ≥5), mildly difficult (IDS = 1-4), and intubation without difficulty (IDS = 0). We also assessed the incidence of the use of Magill forceps or cuff inflation (the cuff of endotracheal tube is inflated with 10-15 ml air) to guide the endotracheal tube into the glottis. Results: AWS nasotracheal intubation was 100% successful. The cuff inflation technique was used in 37 patients. Neither Magill forceps nor other devices were needed for any patient during AWS use. The incidence of difficult nasotracheal intubation was 10% (n = 10). Of the patients, 61% (n = 63) had mildly difficult intubation and 29% (n = 30) had no difficulty. Patients with difficult intubation were more likely to be male and to have a larger tongue and a higher Cormack grade than in the other two groups. Complications, involving minor soft tissue injury, were observed in only 1 patient (1%). Conclusion: The AWS achieves a high success rate for nasotracheal intubation with cuff inflation in patients undergoing dental and maxillofacial surgery.",0,0
10481424,[Anesthetic management for newborn pharyngeal teratoma],"Epignathus (pharyngeal teratoma) is a rare disease of newborns associated with a high mortality secondary to airway obstruction in the neonatal period. We report anesthetic management of a newborn with epignathus who underwent tumor resection. He was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks of gestation and Apgar scores were 9 at 1 and 5 min. The tumor originated from the palate, almost filled the oral cavity and protruded through the mouth with its external part 6 x 7 cm in size. He could breathe with the head and mass turned to the left. The excision of the tumor was scheduled on the fifth day of life. Mask ventilation and laryngoscopy were considered impossible. Fiberoptic nasal intubation was successfully performed with topical anesthesia without sedation. Tumor was resected with blood loss of 103 gm. The trachea was extubated on the third postoperative day and the postoperative course was uneventful. For safe management of cases of pharyngeal teratoma, careful preoperative assessment of the airway is most important and sufficient preparation and careful intubation are mandatory to keep airway patent. The perioperative bleeding from the tumor and the airway obstruction by the tumor or its remnant after the excision could also be hazardous to the airway.",0,0
17065880,Incidence and predictors of difficult and impossible mask ventilation,"Background: Mask ventilation is an essential element of airway management that has rarely been studied as the primary outcome. The authors sought to determine the incidence and predictors of difficult and impossible mask ventilation. Methods: A four-point scale to grade difficulty in performing mask ventilation (MV) is used at the authors' institution. They used a prospective, observational study to identify cases of grade 3 MV (inadequate, unstable, or requiring two providers), grade 4 MV (impossible to ventilate), and difficult intubation. Univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of patient history and physical examination characteristics were used to establish risk factors for grade 3 and 4 MV. Results: During a 24-month period, 22,660 attempts at MV were recorded. 313 cases (1.4%) of grade 3 MV, 37 cases (0.16%) of grade 4 MV, and 84 cases (0.37%) of grade 3 or 4 MV and difficult intubation were observed. Body mass index of 30 kg/m or greater, a beard, Mallampati classification III or IV, age of 57 yr or older, severely limited jaw protrusion, and snoring were identified as independent predictors for grade 3 MV. Snoring and thyromental distance of less than 6 cm were independent predictors for grade 4 MV. Limited or severely limited mandibular protrusion, abnormal neck anatomy, sleep apnea, snoring, and body mass index of 30 kg/m or greater were independent predictors of grade 3 or 4 MV and difficult intubation. Conclusions: The authors observed the incidence of grade 3 MV to be 1.4%, similar to studies with the same definition of difficult MV. Presence of a beard is the only easily modifiable independent risk factor for difficult MV. The mandibular protrusion test may be an essential element of the airway examination.",0,0
24783604,[Successful double-lumen tube insertion using Pentax-AWS Airwayscope with an infant-sized intlock in a rheumatoid arthritis patient with restricted mouth opening and head tilting],"Successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tube was achieved using Pentax-AWS Airwayscope (AWS) with an infant-size Intlock in a patient with restricted mouth opening and head tilting. A 78-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was scheduled for extended thymectomy under general anesthesia, with anticipated difficult airway. Sufficient mask ventilation with the jaw-thrust maneuver was achieved. The laryngoscopic view was defined as grade III (Cormack & Lehane's classification)with Macintosh laryngoscope. The AWS with an infant-size Intlock facilitated visualization of the glottis, leading to a successful placement of a 32-Fr double-lumen tube under the guidance of the AWS image. Double-lumen tube insertion assisted by the AWS with an infant-size Intlock may be useful for difficult airway management in patients with restricted mouth opening and head tilting.",0,0
9338054,Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica presenting at the time of a difficult intubation,"Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is a rare and usually benign disorder affecting the trachea and occasionally the bronchi. We describe the case of a 46-year-old woman who was discovered to have TO at the time of a difficult intubation. This case was also unusual since the patient had presented no previous symptoms despite the presence of extensive endotracheal and bronchial lesions. The incidence of TO appears to be underestimated in the literature in view of the fact that it is usually benign. However, a more accurate estimate of its true prevalence may become available through the use of bronchoscopy and computerized tomographic scanning.",0,0
8222786,Bronchoconstrictive responses to inhaled ultrasonically nebulized distilled water and airway inflammation in asthma,"Twenty-two asthmatic patients with a range of airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine underwent a bronchial challenge with ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW). The presence of positive responses to this stimulus was related to the extent of airway inflammation, as assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical evaluation of bronchial biopsy specimens. Twelve patients had airflow obstruction during distilled water inhalation and they showed more severe disease than subjects with no response, as demonstrated by the higher degree of nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (p < 0.01), higher variability of peak expiratory flow rates (p < 0.01), symptom scores (p < 0.01), and daily use of bronchodilators (p < 0.01). Those patients also had increased numbers of mast cells and eosinophils (p < 0.01) and increased percentage of bronchial epithelial cells expressing endothelin 1 immunoreactivity (p < 0.01). Thus, positive responses to inhaled UNDW reflect the bronchial hyperresponsiveness consistent with moderate to severe asthma and may be due to the release of mediators with bronchoconstrictive properties from inflammatory cells or activated resident cells or both.",0,0
18086067,Airtraq vs standard laryngoscopy by student paramedics and experienced prehospital laryngoscopists managing a model of difficult intubation,"Two consecutive, randomised, cross-over trials compared intubation success rates in third-year paramedic students and experienced prehospital practitioners using the Airtraq or a Macintosh laryngoscope with flexible stylet in a manikin model of a Cormack and Lehane grade III/IV laryngoscopic view. First-time intubation rates for the Macintosh and Airtraq for students were 0/23 (0%) vs 10/23 (44%) (44% difference, 95% CI 26-63%, p < 0.001) and for experienced laryngoscopists were 14/56 (25%) vs 47/56 (84%) (59% difference, 95% CI 42-72%, p < 0.0001), respectively. First-time oesophageal intubation rates for students were 15/23 (65%) vs 3/23 (13%) (-52% difference, 95% CI -25 to -72%, p < 0.001) and for experienced practitioners 9/56 (16%) vs 0/56 (0%) (-16% difference, 95% CI -9 to -28%, p = 0.0014).

24163817,The usefulness of 3-dimensional virtual simulation using haptics in training orotracheal intubation,"Objectives: Airway control is the most critical treatment. The most common and basic method of endotracheal intubation is orotracheal intubation. To perform accurate and rapid tracheal intubation, appropriate education and training are required. We developed the virtual simulation program utilizing the 3-dimensional display and haptic device to exercise orotracheal intubation, and the educational effect of this program was compared with that of the mannequin method. Method: The control group used airway mannequin and virtual intubation group was trained with new program. We videotaped both groups during objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with airway mannequin. The video was reviewed and scored, and the rate of success and time were calculated. Result: The success rate was 78.6% in virtual intubation group and 93.3% in control group (P = 0.273). There was no difference in overall score of OSCE (21.14 ± 4.28 in virtual intubation group and 23.33 ± 4.45 in control group, P = 0.188), the time spent in successful intubation (P = 0.432), and the number of trials (P > 0.101). Conclusion: The virtual simulation with haptics had a similar effect compared with mannequin, but it could be more cost effective and convenient than mannequin training in time and space.",0,0
21220857,Effects of position and phonation on oropharyngeal view and correlation with laryngoscpic view,"Objective: To evaluate the effects of phonation and various head and body positions on oropharyngeal view (Mallampati score), and the correlation of these with laryngoscopic view, using the Cormack and Lehane score. Methodology: Four hundred (390) consecutive patients were evaluated in the wards during preoperative anaesthetic review. During airway assessment, the patients were placed in various head and body positions to determine oropharyngeal structures visualized, with and without phonation, according to the Mallampati test score. In the operating theatre, laryngoscopic view scores (according to Cormack and Lehane) were recorded, and the various scores analyzed. Results: Phonation consistently improved the Mallampati scores in all the head and body positions. The scores were better in the supine position compared to the sitting position. The best correlation of the Mallampati score with the Cormack and Lehane score was in the sitting, head maximally extended position, without phonation. Extention of the head improved the score in the sitting position, but not in the supine position. Phonation reduced the correlation of the scores in all the positions. Conclusion: We conclude that the best position to conduct the Mallampati test is sitting, head maximally extended, without phonation. This correlated best with laryngoscopic view score in our study.",0,0
16161085,Predictive value of infant lung function testing for airway malacia,"Airway malacia is present in a small proportion of wheezing infants. The usefulness of infant lung-function testing (ILFT) in ruling out malacia in wheezy infants is unknown. We assessed the predictive value of ILFT parameters for airway malacia diagnosed by flexible bronchoscopy. Thirty-two term infants (mean (SD) age, 11.0 (4.6) months) with chronic wheeze unresponsive to asthma treatment underwent ILFT prior to bronchoscopy. Functional residual capacity measured by plethysmograph (FRCp), maximal flow at FRC (V'max(FRC)), and tidal breathing parameters were obtained. Expiratory flow-volume curves were visually examined for tidal flow limitation. Malacia was observed during bronchoscopy in 20 infants. V'max(FRC) (Z-score) was significantly lower in the group with malacia as compared with the group without malacia. Lung-function measurements had a low negative predictive value and sensitivity. While flow limitation during tidal breathing was highly predictive and 100% specific for airway malacia, only half of the infants with malacia had tidal flow limitation. In this selected group of infants, routine lung function testing could not discriminate between infants with and without airway malacia. However, the presence of tidal flow limitation was 100% predictive and specific for airway malacia.",0,0

16371615,Innovative airway management for peritonsillar abscess,"Purpose: To describe innovative airway management in an adult with a peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) located atypically in the inferior pole of the palatine tonsil. Clinical features: A 25-yr-old male was admitted for surgical drainage of a left-sided, inferior pole peritonsillar abscess. Previous attempts at intraoral needle and scalpel drainage with topical anesthesia in the emergency department had failed. He had an interdental distance of 1.5 cm and computed tomography imaging showed narrowing of the airway diameter to 8 mm and lateral displacement of the epiglottis. He gargled 10 mL 0.5% lidocaine in the sitting position. We advanced a 3.1-mm pediatric fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) through an orally inserted nasopharyngeal airway to identify the glottis and sprayed 0.5% lidocaine onto the airway mucosa. We replaced the airway with a reinforced 6.5-mm internal diameter tracheal tube (TT), advanced the FOB through it until its tip was just above the carina, and then advanced the TT into the trachea. After iv induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon performed a tonsillectomy and drained the neck abscess. Postoperative direct laryngoscopy revealed a markedly improved airway lumen and tracheal extubation over a Cook Airway Exchange Catheter was uneventful. The patient was stable in the recovery room, and was discharged on the third postoperative day. Conclusion: We present an innovative technique of fibreoptic intubation in an awake patient with an inferior pole peritonsillar abscess.",0,0
23345330,Sox4 is required for the survival of pro-B cells,"The development of mature B cells from hematopoietic stem cells is a strictly orchestrated process involving multiple regulatory genes. The transcription factor Sox4 is required for this process, but its role has not been systematically studied, and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To determine when and how Sox4 functions in the stepwise process of B cell development, we used mice harboring conditional null alleles for Sox4 and a Cre transgene. Sox4 deletion in hematopoietic stem cells almost entirely eliminated pro-B cells in both fetal livers and adult bone marrow, resulting in a severe deficiency in later stage B cells, including circulating mature B cells. Sox4-deficient pro-B cells, particularly those expressing the stem cell factor receptor c-Kit, readily underwent apoptosis, and even more so when c-Kit activity was inhibited by imatinib. C-Kit-expressing pro-B cells showed decreased activation of the c-Kit downstream protein Src upon Sox4 deletion. Likewise, the level of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein was decreased in residual pro-B cells, and its restoration using a Bcl2 transgene allowed not only partial rescue of pro-B cell survival but also B cell maturation in the absence of Sox4. Our findings indicate that Sox4 is required for the survival of pro-B cells and may functionally interact with c-Kit and Bcl2.",0,0
22524029,Simple and efficient biomimetic synthesis of Mn3O4 hierarchical structures and their application in water treatment,"Biotemplate synthesis of functional materials is interesting owing to low cost, high yield and easy way of preparation. Recently, we have developed a simple and cost effective biomimetic synthesis of hierarchical network like nanostructures of manganese oxide (Mn3O4). Readily available eggshell membrane with nucleating and capping sites were used as a template in our synthesis. The prepared material was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, and pore size distribution was obtained by Barrett-Joyner-Helenda (BJH) method. The prepared Mn3O4 showed good ability to remove organic pollutants from water and expected to be useful in effluent treatment in textile industry.",0,0
2892453,A primate model for the evaluation of antihistamines,"Studies of the efficacy of antihistamines in treating human upper airway pathology are difficult to design and conduct. In part, this is the result of a lack of objective measures of the nasal response. The purpose of this study was to develop a monkey model for the objective evaluation of antihistamine effectiveness and, using this model, to study the efficacy of cetirizine. Computer-assisted active anterior rhinomanometry was used to assess nasal airway resistance (NAR) before and after a nasal histamine provocation in conscious rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). To establish dose-response relationships for oral antihistamines in monkeys, we measured the suppression of wheal-and-flare reactions by two such agents, oral cetirizine (CET) 0.1 to 1 mg/kg and chlorpheniramine (CHL) 0.07 to 0.2 mg/kg. The decreases in wheal sizes were maximal 60 to 120 minutes after CET 1.0 mg/kg (90%), and after CHL 0.2 mg/kg (70%). The four monkeys were challenged intranasally with increasing histamine doses (0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg). The NAR was measured 15 minutes after each dose. At least three days later and 90 minutes after oral pretreatment with either CET 1 mg/kg or CHL 0.2 mg/kg, the intranasal challenges were repeated. Postchallenge NAR data are given as the percent increase from the baseline NAR values. The four monkeys studied had coefficients of variation of 13%, 15%, 16%, and 26% respectively for baseline studies. Mean percent increases in NAR +/- standard deviation were 14% +/- 0.4%, 47% +/- 10.0%, 45% +/- 3.0%, and 72% +/- 6.0% after intranasal challenge with 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg of histamine, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
12615034,Bronchoscopy in paediatric intensive care,"Bronchoscopy is a highly versatile technique in the context of intensive care and has many potentially valuable indications. Safety is of paramount importance and the risks in critically unstable patients are correspondingly greater than in more stable children. The main contraindication to bronchoscopy is if it will provide no useful information. The procedure is obviously more risky in children with severe hypoxia, uncontrolled bleeding diathesis, cardiac failure or severe pulmonary hypertension. Monitoring should include at least oxygen saturation, blood pressure (ideally by continuous, invasive monitoring) and preferably capnography. Indications for bronchoscopy in paediatric intensive care include endobronchial toilet, sometimes instilling recombinant human DNAase even in children who do not have cystic fibrosis; checking tube patency and position; assisting in a difficult intubation or tube change; achieving the selective intubation of a main bronchus; the diagnosis and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia or the ventilated, immunocompromised host; the assessment of lobar collapse or focal hyperinflation; airway stent assessment; assessment of stridor on extubation and the diagnosis of any associated disease. New iatrogenic complications are also likely to be discovered. The procedure is very safe if performed by experienced operators with back-up from doctors skilled in airway management and the monitoring of sick children.",0,0
19762747,Obstructive sleep apnea is not a risk factor for difficult intubation in morbidly obese patients,"Background: Morbid obesity (MO), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and neck circumference (NC) are widely believed to be independent risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation. In this study, we sought to determine whether these factors were associated with increased risk of difficult intubation in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The predictive factors tested were OSA and its severity, as determined by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), gender, NC, and body mass index (BMI). Methods: All sequentially enrolled MO patients underwent preoperative polysomnography. Severity of OSA was quantified using AHI and the American Society of Anesthesiologists' OSA severity scale. All patients had a standardized anesthetic that included positioning in the ""ramped position"" for direct laryngoscopy. Results: One hundred eighty consecutive patients were recruited, 140 women and 40 men. The incidence of OSA was 68%. The mean BMI was 49.4 kg/m(2). The mean AHI was 31.3 (range, 0-135). All the patients' tracheas were intubated successfully without the aid of rescue airways by anesthesiology residents. Six patients required three or more intubation attempts, a difficult intubation rate of 3.3%. There was an 8.3% incidence of difficult laryngoscopy, defined as a Cormack and Lehane Grade 3 or 4 view. There was no relationship between NC and difficult intubation (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.93-1.1), between the diagnosis of OSA and difficult intubation (P = 0.09), or between BMI and difficult intubation (odds ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.92-1.06, P = 0.8). There was no relationship between number of intubation attempts and BMI (P = 0.8), AHI (P = 0.82), or NC (P = 0.3). Mallampati Grade III or more predicted difficult intubation (P = 0.02), as did male gender (P = 0.02). Finally, there was no relationship between Cormack and Lehane grade and BMI (P = 0.88), AHI (P = 0.93), or OSA (P = 0.6). Increasing NC was associated with difficult laryngoscopy but not difficult intubation (P = 0.02). Conclusions: In MO patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the ""ramped position,"" there was no relationship between the presence and severity of OSA, BMI, or NC and difficulty of intubation or laryngoscopy grade. Only a Mallampati score of 3 or 4 or male gender predicted difficult intubation.",0,0
25478534,Management of difficult airway with laryngeal mask in a child with mucopolysaccharidosis and mitral regurgitation: a case report,"Introduction: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of heredity storage diseases, transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, associated with the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in various tissues and organs. The concerned patients have multiple concomitant hereditary anomalies. Considering the craniofacial abnormality in these patients, airway management may be difficult for anesthesiologists. In these patients, preanesthetic assessment is necessary and performed with the accurate assessment of airways, consisting of the physical exam and radiography, MRI or CT of head and neck. An anesthesiologist should set up a ""difficult intubation set"" with a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope and also, it may be necessary to discuss with an ear-nose and throat (ENT) specialist if required, for unpredicted emergency situations. Case presentation: In this case-report we presented a 2-year-old boy with known MPSs with psychomotor retardation, bilateral corneal opacities, impaired hearing and vision, inguinal hernia, severe mitral regurgitation, micrognathia, coarse facial feature, stiff and short neck and restricted mouth opening.

18784889,[Establishment of a system of using cephalometrics to predict difficult intubation],"Purpose: Difficult airway is one of the main problems which attract much attention from the anesthesiologists, many clinical standards are used to predict the patient's airway, but the investigation of using radiological measurements to predict difficult intubation is seldom carried out. This study combined the previous researches to establish a system of using cephalometrics to predict difficult intubation. Methods: Patients who underwent general anesthesia were involved with preoperative cephalometric examination. The way to take radiographs was as follows: X-ray cephalometric were casted from left to right, parameters were 80kV, 10mA, the time of exposal was 2 seconds. All of the X-ray cephalometric radiographs were scanned into computer, then measured with the software of ""CASSOS 2001"". Results: 22 cephalometric parameters including soft tissues, hard tissues, airway space and hyoid could be measured. Conclusions: X-ray cephalometric radiography may achieve difficult intubation prediction, but the efficiency and accuracy of this technique need further evaluation.",0,0
17275534,Adenotonsillectomy and obstructive sleep apnea in children: a prospective survey,"Objective: Prospective survey of children up to 14 years of age with OSA submitted to adenotonsillectomy. Methods: Clinical evaluation, with questionnaires and clinical scales evaluating facial structures including tonsils and Mallampati scales and otolaryngologic evaluation; nocturnal polysomnography and repeat evaluation three to five months postsurgery. Results: Of 207 successively seen children, 199 had follow-up polysomnography, and 94 had still abnormal sleep recording. Multivariate analysis indicates that Mallampati scale score 3 and 4, retro-position of mandible, enlargement of nasal inferior turbinates at +3 (subjective scale 1 to 3), and deviated septum were significantly associated with persistence of abnormal polysomnography (with high 95% CI for Mallampati scale and deviated septum). Conclusion: Mallampati scale scores are resultant of several facial factors involving maxilla, mandible, and oral versus oral breathing but add information on risk of partial response to adenotonsillectomy. Significance: Adenotonsillectomy may not resolve obstructive sleep apnea in children.",0,0
16918119,Airway management: a patient with Madelung disease,"This case study describes a 51-year-old, ASA physical status II Hispanic man who underwent liposuction to the anterior neck and resection of adipose tissue of the posterior neck. The patient was diagnosed with multiple symmetric lipomatosis, better known by its eponym, Madelung disease. This disease is characterized by abnormal adipose tissue growth primarily in the neck and shoulder regions. As a result of this pathology, a complete airway assessment was challenging. The patient's Mallampati classification was class III with visualization of the soft palate only. Other elements of a full assessment such as thyromental distance, sternomental distance, and tracheal orientation were impossible to evaluate because of the extreme circumferential girth of the adipose tissue in the neck. In addition, flexion and extension of the neck was limited by a minimum of 20 degrees because of the pathology. The patient was deemed as having a difficult airway, and an awake fiberoptic intubation was planned and used successfully. The subsequent surgical procedure progressed without incident, and the patient was transferred to a stepdown unit for monitoring of his airway postoperatively.",0,0
25948902,A comparison of the Mallampati test in supine and upright positions with and without phonation in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation: A prospective study,"Background and aims: Difficult ventilation and intubation have been recognized as the forerunners of hypoxic brain damage during anesthesia. To overcome catastrophic events during anesthesia, an assessment of the airway before induction is of paramount importance. We designed this study to compare the effect of phonation on the Mallampati test in supine and upright positions as against the traditionally employed test without phonation in serving to predict difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Material and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 661 patients aged 16-60 years were recruited during the years 2011 to 2012. The Mallampati test was conducted on patients with and without phonation in both the sitting and supine positions. A blinded observer then performed laryngoscopy and intubation. Difficult intubation was assessed according to the Cormack-Lehane Grading scale. Statistical analysis used: Diagnostic statistical measures for each of the four situations - sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy - were calculated. Results: In this study, 28 patients (4.2%) had difficult laryngoscopy and nine patients (1.4%) had difficult intubation. There was no difference in the sensitivity of the Mallampati test as regards prediction of laryngoscopy and intubation in the four different positions, but the upright position along with phonation had the highest specificity. The negative predictive value was above 95% in all the positions; however, the positive predictive value was the highest in the supine position along with phonation. Conclusion: Based on our results, the supine position along with phonation had the best correlation in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. We further conclude that phonation significantly improved the Mallampati class in the supine position compared with the upright position.",1,1
19483438,Retrograde intubation: an alternative way for the management of difficult airway,"Inserting a retrograde wire into the pharynx through a cricothyroid puncture can facilitate tracheal intubation in difficult situations where either a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope or an expert user of such a device is not available. Even in cases when fibropric can not be negotiated for the purpose, this method has been claimed to be useful to manage the airway. Some mouth opening is essential for the oral or nasal retrieval of the wire from the pharynx. Here, a case of post mandibular reconstructed wound infection required surgical debridement and plate removal from reconstructed lower mandible under general anesthesia. We retrieved the guide wire passed through a cricothyroid puncture and subsequently accomplished wire-guided oro-tracheal intubation. In the absence of a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope, this technique is a very useful aid to intubate patients with limited mouth opening.",0,0
23813051,Awake endotracheal retrograde intubation in restricted mouth opening: a 'J'-tipped guide wire technique--a retrospective study,"Introduction: Airway management in patient with restricted mouth opening is a great challenge, owing to the difficulty in laryngoscopy and visualisation of the vocal cords during the procedure of intubation. The term retrograde intubation refers to a technique in which a guide wire is passed into the trachea and then into the mouth or nose. A tracheal tube is then passed down over the guide until it enters the trachea. Material and method: A retrospective audit was undertaken to determine the success and complication associated with retrograde intubation. Results: The results show that in a sample of 20 patients in which retrograde intubation was done, only three developed sore throat and cough, one had bronchospasm and one developed infection at the site of insertion of a J-tipped catheter. Conclusion: Retrograde tracheal intubation was easy to perform and had a high success rate and a low incidence of complications.",0,0
15819763,A comparison of direct laryngoscopy and jaw thrust to aid fibreoptic intubation,"We compared two manoeuvres, jaw thrust and laryngoscopy, to open the airway during fibreoptic intubation in 50 patients after induction of anaesthesia in a crossover study. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either jaw thrust or conventional Macintosh laryngoscopy first. Airway clearance was assessed at both the soft palate and the epiglottis. Direct laryngoscopy provided significantly better airway clearance at the level of the soft palate than jaw thrust (44 (88%) vs 31 (62%), respectively; p = 0.002). At the level of the larynx, airway clearance was equally good in both groups (45 (90%) vs 46 (92%), respectively; p = 0.56). The times to view the larynx (median (interquartile range [range]) 4 (3-5 [2-35]) s vs 3 (3-4 [2-8]) s, respectively) and intubation time (20 (17-23 [11-83]) s vs 18 (15-20 [11-28]) s, respectively) were also similar.",0,0
11812721,Difficult retrograde endotracheal intubation: the utility of a pharyngeal loop,"Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation remains the technique of choice to achieve control of the airway. Alternative or additional techniques of airway control are required whenever an airway is deemed difficult because of anatomical and/or technical reasons. The retrograde intubation technique is an important option for gaining airway access from below the vocal cords in such situations (1). We report successful management and the problems encountered while gaining the upper airway by the retrograde catheter method in a patient having bilateral fibrous ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Implications: A 30-yr-old woman presented for redo-release of bilateral temporomandibular joint ankylosis under general anesthesia. During the previous anesthetic for primary release of ankylosis, tracheostomy was done, as conventional blind nasotracheal and retrograde intubation attempts failed several times.

8919901,[The laryngeal mask--a valuable instrument for cases of difficult intubation in children. Anesthesiologic management in the presence of Pierre-Robin syndrome],"In cases of craniofacial and mandibulofacial malformations, which are mostly treated during childhood, difficult intubation conditions must generally be expected. In such cases, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) an alternative instrument for use in endotracheal intubation is a new aid for ventilation. In certain instances, it can be used alone to induce general anaesthesia. Reports of endotracheal intubation by means of the LMA in adults have also been published. Case report: In our case, a 6-year-old boy with Pierre-Robin syndrome (triad: micrognathia, broad palatoschisis, glossoptosis) needed dental resetting. After induction of anaesthesia in this very cooperative boy with thiopentone and fluothane and relaxation with succinylcholine, it was not possible to examine the hypopharynx by laryngoscopy preparatory to nasal intubation as usual. Repeated blind attempts at nasal intubation (again with spontaneous breathing) failed, as did the attempt at fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation, because of the narrow anatomical conditions. Finally, a laryngeal mask airway (LMA; size 2) was introduced, and as a result of this ventilation was achieved. However, endotracheal intubation was required for performance of the surgical resetting. With the fibreoptic bronchoscope, we could verify the central position of the LMA over the glottis. A tracheal tube (size 4) was inserted across the laryngeal airway without optic control. The tube connector was disconnected and a normal guide inserted into the tube to remove the LMA. The dental resetting was also performed by oral intubation. Conclusion: Therefore, the LMA is not only a ventilation aid, but also a valuable tool in difficult intubation conditions. In our opinion, it is necessary to provide this tool in every anaesthetic unit.",0,0
25453860,"Laryngeal mask, laryngeal tube, and Frova introducer in simulated difficult airway","Background: The use of supraglottic devices is rising in the prehospital management of difficult airway; moreover, we think that patients with multiple trauma or cervical instability can take advantage of these devices without opening or retiring the cervical collar. Objective: To compare speed and ease of use between Laryngeal Tube S (LTS) and the Ambu AuraOnce laryngeal mask (LMA).Our second objective was to evaluate changing these devices to an endotracheal tube (ETT) using a Frova introducer. Methods: We studied the use of LTS and LMA in an experimental model, represented by a manikin with a rigid cervical collar and a limited mouth opening. This study was carried out in Complutense University of Madrid with 145 2(nd)-year students for the degree in Dentistry who have knowledge of the airway but lack experience in intubation. Number of attempts and time for the device's insertion were measured, as well as time for the exchange maneuver using the Frova introducer. Results: Insertion of all devices was possible on the first attempt; time for insertion was LTS 12.2 ± 1.28 s and LMA 6.87 ± 0.97 s. Once these devices were inserted, a Frova introducer is used to perform an exchange by an endotracheal tube; all devices could be exchanged on the first attempt, and exchange time was LTS 26.9 ± 1.2 s and LMA 16.79 ± 1.32 s. Results for both time for insertion and exchange of the LMA were significantly lower than those for the LTS (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The method used can be considered quick and easy, even for personnel inexperienced in intubation. This exchange maneuver has not been described previously, so we can consider it as a new application of the Frova introducer.",0,0

1781521,Predicting difficult intubation,"Two pre-operative tests for the prediction of difficult intubation are assessed. A modified Mallampati test and a measurement of thyromental distance were performed at the pre-operative visit of 244 patients whose tracheas were subsequently intubated under general anaesthesia. Patients in whom the posterior pharyngeal wall could not be visualised below the soft palate, who also had a distance of less than 7 cm between the prominence of the thyroid cartilage and the bony point of the chin proved significantly more likely to present difficulty with intubation. The performance of these two simple tests on all patients before operation should allow the majority of cases of difficult intubation to be anticipated.",1,1
21081768,Preoperative endoscopic airway examination (PEAE) provides superior airway information and may reduce the use of unnecessary awake intubation,"Background: Development of a perioperative plan for management of patients with airway pathology is a challenge for the anesthesiologist. Lack of comprehensive information regarding the architecture of airway lesions often leads the clinician to consider techniques of awake intubation (AI) to avoid catastrophic outcomes in this population. In one uncontrolled trial, endoscopic visualization of the airway lesion was included in the preoperative anesthetic assessment for planning of airway management. We sought to determine whether visual inspection of airway pathology would change the anesthesiologist's approach to the management of these patients. Methods: Patients presenting for elective diagnostic or therapeutic airway procedures were included in the study. After a standard examination of the airway, a management plan was recorded. Before entering the operating room, and after brief preparation of the nares with a vasoconstrictor and local anesthetic, the patients underwent a preoperative endoscopic airway examination (PEAE) and a final airway management plan was recorded and implemented. Four or more months after the procedure, video recordings of the PEAE were reviewed without other patient identifiers and a remote PEAE plan was recorded, to test for operator bias. Results: One hundred thirty-eight patients were studied. Although AI was initially planned in 44 patients, only 16 of these patients underwent preinduction airway control after PEAE (P > 0.05). Additionally, of the 94 patients for whom the initial plan was airway control after the induction of anesthesia, 8 patients were found to have unexpectedly severe airway pathology on PEAE, and also underwent AI. There was no significant difference between the post-PEAE airway management plan and the remote plan recorded 4 or more months later. Conclusions: In 26% of the patients studied, PEAE affected the planned airway management. We believe that PEAE can be an essential component of the preoperative assessment of patients with airway pathology; airway visualization reduces the number of unnecessary AIs while providing superior information about the airway architecture. PEAE could be applied to other populations of patients at risk for airway control failure with the induction of anesthesia.",0,0
14755218,Clinical predictors of difficult laryngeal exposure,"Purpose: Although difficult laryngeal exposure (DLE) is a common problem encountered after procedures using a rigid laryngoscope, to date, no anticipatory physical indicators have been formally noted as reliable predictors of DLE. The purpose of this paper is to identify useful and reliable indicators by which to predict, with acceptable accuracy, the occurrence of DLE following rigid laryngoscopy. Study design: Fifty-six patients, each of whom had undergone a rigid laryngoscope procedure, were classified as belonging to either the DLE group (n = 19) or the control group (n = 37) for purposes of this prospective study. Methods: All patients were given a physical examination, which encompassed the following nine measures: age, sex, modified Mallampati index (MMI), body mass index (BMI), hyoid-mental distance (HMD), thyroid-mental distance (TMD), thyroid-mandible angle (TMA), horizontal thyroid distance (HTD), and vertical thyroid distance (VTD). Stepwise regression was employed on patient data to identify those with DLE. RESULTS The ages of patients in the DLE group ranged from 35 to 79 years, with a mean of 51.3 years. Among the nine variables, we found sex (P =.045, odds ratio = 69.159) and TMA (P =.004, odds ratio = 1.510) to be ""reliable"" DLE predictors. Using these two variables, 94.6% of study case patients could have been correctly classified preoperatively. Based on our comparison of case results, we found that a TMA value greater than 120 degrees in men and 130 degrees in women indicates a strong likelihood of DLE. CONCLUSIONS TMA is a sensitive, reliable, and useful predictor of DLE in both men and women. The combination of sex and TMA provide important initial clinical indicators that can alert a clinician regarding DLE probability.",0,0
12879683,An unusual cause of locked jaw and its airway management,We describe the management of a patient impaled through the medial aspect of the left orbit by the brake lever of a mountain bike which immobilized her jaw by obstructing the right coronoid process of the mandible and blocked access to the mouth and trachea. The fire service used special equipment to cut out the rest of the bike from the handle bar. The patient with the penetrating brake lever attached to the handlebar in situ was transported to the hospital by rescue helicopter.

8552863,Methacholine-induced histamine liberation during airway challenge tests in Ascaris skin-sensitive sheep,"The interaction of vagal neuronal and pharmacological mediator mechanisms on the airway-constrictory responses obtained from challenges with aerosolized methacholine (MCH) before and after bilateral vagotomy and in combination with electrical stimulation of the peripheral ends of the cut vagal nerves was investigated in anesthetized Ascaris allergen skin-sensitive sheep. Inhalation of aerosols of 2 and 5% MCH for 2 min in a control group of 10 sheep resulted in airway muscle constriction indicated by an increase in dynamic elastance (Edyn) (+70 and +256% of the basic value) or inspiratory airway resistance (RI) (+45 and +155%) and was associated with a significant rise in plasma histamine concentration (HiPl) from 0.2 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 1.1 and 1.5 +/- 1.2 ng/ml, respectively. Respiratory and cardiovascular responses to MCH were reproducible after 90 min of recovery. A second group of another 6 intact sheep showed similar alterations of respiratory mechanical parameters and HiPl after MCH challenges. After bilateral vagotomy, Edyn and RI increased after 2 and 5% MCH inhalation only by 15-30% of the control responses with intact vagi. The diminished airway constriction was associated with similar changes in HiP1 as observed with intact vagi. Inspite of severe cardiovascular responses, the most effective electrical stimulation of the peripheral ends of the vagal nerves resulted in an increase in Edyn or RI by only 40-50% of the basic value. In a tracheal segment beneath the cuff of the endotracheal tube isometric pressure effectively increased by almost 500% of the basic value. Vagus nerve stimulation was found without detectable changes in HiPl. Stimulation of the central ends of the vagal nerves did not induce airway constriction or alterations in HiPl. The combination of electrical vagus nerve stimulation and MCH inhalation resulted in a more than additive increase in Edyn and RI, but the airway responses did not reach the same level of obstruction after challenge with 5% MCH as observed with intact vagi. Electrical stimulation of the efferent vagi failed to stimulate spontaneous vagal nerve activity at higher levels of airway muscle responses. The results demonstrate that vagal neuronal mechanisms interact with local mediator liberation in acute airway obstruction. Airway challenge tests using cholinergic substances liberate histamine from inflammatory cells in the lungs of Ascaris skin-sensitive sheep.",0,0
1419013,Hemodynamic and respiratory effects of transtracheal high-frequency jet ventilation during difficult intubation,"Study objective: To evaluate the hemodynamic and respiratory effects of percutaneous transtracheal high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) during difficult intubation using fiberoptic bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Surgical patients scheduled for general anesthesia at the Medical College of Virginia Hospital. Patients: Eight patients with known difficult airways. Three patients had deformed facial structures. One patient had temporomandibular joint impairment. Four patients had tumors of the oral cavity with deformed upper airways. Interventions: A 13-gauge cricothyroidotomy jet ventilation cannula was inserted percutaneously under local anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with etomidate 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg, alfentanil 15 to 20 micrograms/kg, and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. HFJV was started with 100% oxygen at 30 to 35 pounds per square inch of driving pressure, 100 cycles per minute, and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 25%. Thoracic electrical bioimpedance was used to measure cardiac index (CI) and ejection fraction (EF). Measurements and main results: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), CI, and EF were measured before induction of anesthesia; after 1 minute of HFJV, 5 minutes of HFJV, and 10 minutes of HFJV; and during positive pressure ventilation following fiberoptic intubation. Arterial blood gas samples were obtained before induction of anesthesia and after 10 minutes of HFJV. HR decreased significantly after 5 minutes of HFJV, after 10 minutes of HFJV, and after intubation (p less than 0.05). MAP decreased significantly after 10 minutes of HFJV compared with the preinduction value (mean, 97 to 71 mmHg; p less than 0.01). Although EF increased significantly following intubation, from 46% to 59%, there were no significant changes in CI. Arterial oxygen tension increased from 85 to 240 mmHg (p less than 0.05). Arterial carbon dioxide tension also increased, from 39 to 42 mmHg (p less than 0.05). Conclusions: Transtracheal HFJV under general anesthesia with etomidate, alfentanil, and vecuronium provided satisfactory hemodynamic conditions and pulmonary gas exchange. Percutaneous transtracheal HFJV can be used safely to manage patients with a difficult airway under general anesthesia using fiberoptic bronchoscopy.",0,0
22007870,Retention and transmission of active transcription memory from progenitor to progeny cells via ligand-modulated transcription factors: elucidation of a concept by BIOPIT model,"Observations made in live cells have clearly demonstrated that agonist-activated steroid/nuclear receptors reorganize in the nucleoplasm into hundreds of discrete speckled structures commonly referred to as nuclear foci. Subsequent studies have shown that nuclear foci are formed only with agonist- and not with pure antagonist-bound receptors. Also, the other accessory components of transcriptional machinery co-localize in nuclear foci with the activated receptors, suggesting these to be active gene transcription sites. Recently, it has been observed that during mitosis nuclear foci present in interphase of progenitor cells co-migrate with condensing chromatin and are inherited into the progeny cells. Ensuing events imply that as memory, the cells inherit only a biomolecular blueprint of transcription status over to next generations to express and sustain their characteristic proteome. Thus, cells achieve self-renewal via mitosis but not without ensuring that the characteristic proteome and traits are distinctively preserved during this transcription phase. This mechanism, although somewhat analogous to epigenetic marking, differs in Nature since transcription factors themselves execute this transmission. To uphold the mechanistic distinctions the phenomenon has been termed BIOPIT (biomolecular imprints offered to progeny for inheritance of traits). The BIOPIT model proposed herein attempts to explain how the disruption of BIOPIT markings by therapeutic anti-hormones or endocrine disruptors over prolonged periods may lead to eradication of cellular transcription memory with deleterious cellular consequences. It is anticipated that our model has the potential to explain the concerted actions and consequences of ligand-receptor interactions with the chromatin in the perspective of normal and aberrant physiological situations.",0,0
10479842,[Hypertrophy of the lingual tonsil and difficulty in airway control. A clinical case],"A male patient suffering for exertional angina was scheduled for coronary bypass. Physical examination was unremarkable except for oropharynx classified as Mallampati II. After anesthetic induction with fentanyl 10 micrograms/kg, thiopental 5 mg/kg and muscle relaxation with succynilcoline 1 mg/kg, the patient was ventilated via a face mask. Laryngoscopy revealed a bulky mass arising from the rigth base of the tongue hiding the epiglottis and all the vocal apparatus (Cormack class 4); a failed intubation caused bleeding. Facial mask ventilation became more difficult therefore, considering the task on managing the airway, a n. 4 laryngeal mask was positioned by the senior anesthetist. Two intubation attempts failed while ventilation via laryngeal mask became more and more difficult. Surgery was therefore cancelled due to inability to airway management. The mass, biopsied by an otolaryngologist, resulted to be a lingual tonsillar hyperthrophy and therefore was not removed. The patients was re-scheduled for cardiac surgery. Maintaining spontaneous breathing during light sedation, with topical anesthesia, this patient was successfully intubated over an Olympus BF P 10 bronchoscope. The patient had an uneventful operation, was regularly extubated and was discharged on the sixth postoperative day free from airway complications. Although we followed only some of the guidelines for the management of the difficult airway: a senior anesthetist was immediately called when an anatomic alteration was evident; progressive difficulty in maintaining the airway prompted the positioning of a LMA, the restoration of the spontaneous breathing and the cancellation of the elective operation had been mandatory when a class 4 Cormack was found at laryngoscopy. This situation requires an alternative approach to intubation or with the retrograde technique or with the aid of a fiberscope both maintaining spontaneous breathing.",0,0
404933,Pharyngeal pouch as a cause of difficult intubation,The presence of a lateral pharyngeal pouch may cause difficulty in recognising the glottis when awake intubation is undertaken.

17317731,"Quality, size, and composition of pediatric endobronchial biopsies in cystic fibrosis","Background: Studies on airway remodeling in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be hampered by difficulty in obtaining evaluable endobronchial biopsy specimens because of large amounts of mucus and inflammation in the CF airway. We prospectively assessed how the quality of biopsy specimens obtained from children with CF compare with those from children with other airway diseases. Methods: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy was performed in 67 CF children (age range, 0.2 to 16.8 years), 34 children with wheeze/asthma (W/A), and 64 control children with chronic respiratory symptoms. Up to three biopsy specimens were taken and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Biopsy specimen size and structural composition were quantified using stereology. Results: At least one evaluable biopsy specimen was obtained in 72% of CF children, in 79% of children with W/A, and in 72% of control subjects (difference was not significant). The use of large biopsy forceps (2.0 mm) rather than small biopsy forceps (1.0 mm) [odds ratio (OR), 5.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 to 29.8; p = 0.037] and the number of biopsy specimens taken (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 5.2; p = 0.006) significantly contributed to the success rate. Biopsy size and composition were similar between groups, except that CF children and those patients with W/A had a higher percentage of the biopsy specimen composed of muscle than did control subjects (median 6.2% and 9.7% vs 0.9%, respectively; p = 0.002). Conclusions: Biopsy size and quality are adequate for the study of airway remodeling in CF children as young as 2 months of age. Researchers should use large forceps when possible and take at least two biopsy specimens per patient. An increased airway smooth muscle content of the airway mucosa may contribute to the pathophysiology of CF lung disease.",0,0
24257384,Thyromental height: a new clinical test for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy,"Background: The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy is reported in the range of 1.5% to 20%. We hypothesized that there is a close association between the occurrence of difficult laryngoscopy and the height between the anterior borders of the mentum and thyroid cartilage, while the patient lies supine with her/his mouth closed. We have termed this the ""thyromental height test"" (TMHT). Our aim in this study was to determine its utility in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Methods: Three hundred fourteen consecutive male and female patients aged ≥ 16 years scheduled to undergo general anesthesia were invited to participate. Airway assessments were performed with the modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance and sternomental distance, and TMHT in the preoperative clinic. Afterward, Cormack and Lehane grade of laryngoscopy views was assessed during intubation. The laryngoscopist was unaware of airway assessments. As a primary end point, the validity and prediction indexes for the TMHT were calculated. Calculation of validity indexes for the 3 other methods of airway assessment was a secondary objective of this study. Results: The optimal sensitivity and specificity values were in the range of 47.46 to 51.02 mm. To facilitate clinical application, a cutoff value equal to 50 mm was chosen. TMHT was more accurate than the other tests (all P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The TMHT appears to be a more accurate predictor of difficult laryngoscopy than the existing anatomical measurements.",0,0
19032303,"Prevalence of difficult intubation in a bariatric population, using the beach chair position","We retrospectively reviewed the anaesthetic charts of patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in our regional centre since the start of the service.

The patients were anaesthetised in the in the 'beach chair' position prior to laryngoscopy. One hundred and ninety-two patients' notes were available for review out of a total of 198. Mean age was 43.3 years (SD 10.3) and mean BMI 50.8 (SD 8.0). Grade of laryngoscopy was unrecorded in 20 patients. Of the 192 patients, 162 (84%) had a Cormack and Lehane grade of 1 or 2. Nine (4.7%) patients were graded as 3 and only one patient had a grade 4 laryngoscopy. There were two cases (1%) of difficulty in intubation. A bougie was used 16 times (8%).

23121322,Tracheal intubation with a camera embedded in the tube tip (Vivasight(™) ),"We studied tracheal intubation in manikins and patients with a camera embedded in the tip of the tracheal tube (Vivasight(™) ). Four people in two teams and two individuals attempted intubation of a manikin through an i-gel(™) 10 times each. The tracheas of 12 patients with a Mallampati grade of 1 were intubated with a Vivasight tracheal tube through a Berman airway, passed over a Frova(™) introducer. All 60 manikin intubations were successful, taking a mean (SD) time of 1.4 (0.5) s. The fastest intubation was performed in 0.5 s. All 12 participants' tracheas were successfully intubated in a median (IQR [range]) time of 90 (70-120 [50-210]) s. Seven participants complained of a sore throat, comparable with earlier findings for standard laryngoscopy and intubation: five mild; one moderate; and one severe. Tracheal intubation with the Vivasight through the i-gel or Berman airway is an alternative to existing techniques, against which it should be compared in randomised controlled trials in human participants. It has potential as a fast airway rescue technique.",0,0
19608824,Prehospital intubations and mortality: a level 1 trauma center perspective,"Background: Ryder Trauma Center is a Level 1 trauma center with approximately 3800 emergency admissions per year. In this study, we sought to determine the incidence of failed prehospital intubations (PHI), its correlation with hospital mortality, and possible risk factors associated with PHI. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted evaluating trauma patients who had emergency prehospital airway management and were admitted during the period between August 2003 and June 2006. The PHI was considered a failure if the initial assessment determined improper placement of the endotracheal tube or if alternative airway management devices were used as a rescue measure after intubation was attempted. Results: One-thousand-three-hundred-twenty patients had emergency airway interventions performed by an anesthesiologist upon arrival at the trauma center. Of those, 203 had been initially intubated in the field by emergency medical services personnel, with 74 of 203 (36%) surviving to discharge. When evaluating the success of the intubation, 63 of 203 (31%) met the criteria for failed PHI, all of them requiring intubation, with only 18 of 63 (29%) surviving to discharge. These patients had rescue airway management provided either via Combitube (n = 28), Laryngeal Mask Airway (n = 6), or a cricothyroidotomy (n = 4). An additional 25 of 63 patients (12%) had unrecognized esophageal intubations discovered upon the initial airway assessment performed on arrival. We found no difference in mortality between those patients who were properly intubated and those who were not. Several other variables, including age, gender, weight, mechanism of injury, presence of facial injuries, and emergency medical services were not correlated with an increased incidence of failed intubations. Conclusion: This prospective study showed a 31% incidence of failed PHI in a large metropolitan trauma center. We found no difference in mortality between patients who were properly intubated and those who were not, supporting the use of bag-valve-mask as an adequate method of airway management for critically ill trauma patients in whom intubation cannot be achieved promptly in the prehospital setting.",0,0
10763692,Segmental cervical spine motion during orotracheal intubation of the intact and injured spine with and without external stabilization,"Object: The purpose of this study was to establish a cadaveric model for evaluating cervical spine motion in both the intact and injured states and to examine the efficacy of commonly used stabilization techniques in limiting that motion. Methods: Intubation was performed in fresh human cadavers with intact cervical spines, following the creation of a C4-5 posterior ligamentous injury. Movement of the cervical spine during direct laryngoscopy and intubation was recorded using video fluoroscopy and examined under the following conditions: 1) without external stabilization; 2) with manual in-line cervical immobilization; and 3) with Gardner-Wells traction. Subsequently, segmental motion of the occiput through C-5 (Oc-C5) was measured from digitized frames of the recorded video fluoroscopy. The predominant motion, at all levels measured in the intact spine, was extension. The greatest degree of motion occurred at the atlantooccipital (Oc-C1) junction, followed by the C1-2 junction, with progressively less motion at each more caudal level. After posterior destabilization was induced, the predominant direction of motion at C4-5 changed from extension to flexion, but the degree of motion remained among the least of all levels measured. Traction limited but did not prevent motion at the Oc-C1 junction, but neither traction nor immobilization limited motion at the destabilized C4-5 level. Conclusions: Cadaveric cervical spine motion accurately reflected previously reported motion in living, anesthetized patients. Traction was the most effective method of reducing motion at the occipitocervical junction, but none of the interventions significantly reduced movement at the subaxial site of injury. These findings should be considered when treating injured patients requiring orotracheal intubation.",0,0
9785778,[Usefulness of the intubating laryngeal mask airway for cases with predicted difficult intubation],"We evaluated the usefulness of the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) in patients who were predicted to have possible difficult airway. Patients with possible difficult airway were defined as those with limited head extension, Mallampati's classification of grade IV, thyro-mental distance < 4 cm, or Cormack grade III-IV on the laryngoscopy. The control group was consisted of the patients without these conditions or impaired mouth opening. Insertion of the ILMA was successfully performed in all patients of both groups. In the group of possible difficult airway, 83% of patients were intubated through the ILMA successfully, and in the control group, 86%. We conclude that the ILMA may become an additional tool in patients with difficult intubation.",0,0
25885516,Anesthetic management of congenital epulis in neonate,"The most common cause of difficult intubation in pediatrics is due to congenital anomalies of airway. We report a case of neonate with congenital epulis (CE) who presented with a difficult airway. A 7-day old neonate weighted 3.2 kg with a large mass occupying the oral cavity that was diagnosed as congenital epulis was scheduled for excision biopsy. The mass was large, mobile, and moving in and out with no clear pedicle. An intravenous line was inserted and secured. The airway was then assessed while the patient was awake and an assistant displaced the mass and a laryngoscope was placed to visualize the larynx easily. After preoxygenation, inhalation induction of anesthesia was accomplished using sevoflurane in oxygen. Endotracheal intubation was performed with conventional laryngoscopy. The baby made uneventful recovery after the surgical procedure. In conclusion, epulis presents a real challenge to anesthesiologists. It can be excised either under local or general anesthesia, depending on the size of its pedicle. If done under general anesthesia, assessment of the airway is mandatory for better airway management and safe endotracheal intubation.",0,0
8542147,Airway responsiveness to bradykinin is related to eosinophilic inflammation in asthma,"We investigated the relationship between airway inflammation and airway responsiveness, as assessed by PD15, to methacholine and to bradykinin in asthmatic patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial biopsies, and methacholine and bradykinin challenges were performed in 18 nonsmoking subjects with mild or moderate perennial asthma. Bradykinin PD15 correlated negatively with eosinophil count in BAL (p < 0.05), in the epithelium (p < 0.05), in the lamina propria (p = 0.02) and in the total submucosa (p < 0.01). Conversely, no significant correlation existed between airway responsiveness to methacholine and eosinophil count in BAL or in airway mucosa. Airway responsiveness to either agonist did not correlate with the thickness of the basement membrane, the shedding of the airway epithelium, the count of lymphocytes in the airway mucosa, or the percentage of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophage in BAL. The presence of degranulated eosinophils was associated with an increased number of eosinophils in the airway epithelium (p = 0.04), in the lamina propria (p = 0.03), in the total submucosa (p = 0.02), and with increased airway responsiveness to bradykinin (p < 0.02). We conclude that in asthmatic patients, airway responsiveness to bradykinin but not to methacholine is related to the magnitude of eosinophilic inflammation in the airway mucosa.",0,0

20217151,Is the modified Mallampati test performed in supine position a reliable predictor of difficult tracheal intubation?,"Management of the airway is central to the practice of anesthesia. Several bedside airway assessment methods have been proposed for preoperative identification of patients who are difficult to intubate. The modified Mallampati test (MMT) remains a time-tested technique to date for recognizing an anticipated difficult tracheal intubation as assessed by Cormack-Lehane grade. Both Mallampati and its further modification by Samsoon and Young evaluate patients in the seated position. Recently a study mentioned a change in MMT score from sitting to supine position toward the higher side. However, there is a lack of data regarding the relationship of positional change in MMT with Cormack-Lehane grade. The aim of this prospective study was to assess if MMT score observed in sitting or supine position is a better predictor of difficult tracheal intubation. One hundred and twenty-three patients of ASA physical status I and II, aged 18-60 years, who were scheduled to undergo various neurosurgical procedures were enrolled for the study. We found that the MMT in supine position has a higher positive predictive value and is associated with more true positives as compared to MMT in the sitting position.",0,0
9036448,"[Blunt trauma of the larynx: comparative assessment of computerized tomography, conventional radiology, and laryngoscopy]","We report on the retrospective analysis of a series of 11 patients with blunt laryngeal injuries examined with Computed Tomography (CT), conventional radiology and laryngoscopy, to compare the diagnostic yield of each technique. Conventional frontal and lateral radiographs showed subcutaneous emphysema in 5 patients, with soft tissue swelling in 4, and thus failed to assess the degree of damage adequately. Cross-section CT showed cartilaginous injuries in 5 patients and adjacent soft tissue changes in 9, thus allowing rapid and accurate assessment of airway damage even in emergency. Laryngoscopy showed laryngeal mucosal tears in 3 patients, with decreased motion of the left true vocal cord in one patient and of both true vocal cords in another, associated with the upward dislocation of arytenoid cartilage. Moreover, laryngoscopy showed a mucosal tear in the hypopharynx in one patient. Comparative CT and laryngoscopy assessment showed, in two cases, that CT can demonstrate even minimal peripharyngeal and perilaryngeal air images which are suggestive of posttraumatic mucosal tears. Thus, CT appears the most valuable diagnostic tool to study the injured larynx.",0,0
21948956,Poor prognostic value of the modified Mallampati score: a meta-analysis involving 177 088 patients,"The modified Mallampati score is used to predict difficult tracheal intubation. We have conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the Mallampati score as a prognostic test. A total of 55 studies involving 177 088 patients were included after comprehensive electronic and manual searches. The pooled estimates from the meta-analyses were calculated based on a random-effects model and a summary receiver operating curve. Meta-regression analyses were performed to explore sources of possible heterogeneity between the studies. The summary receiver operating curve demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.75. The pooled odds ratio for a difficult intubation with a modified Mallampati score of III or IV was 5.89 [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.74-7.32]. The pooled estimates of the specificity and sensitivity were 0.91 (CI, 0.91-0.91) and 0.35 (CI, 0.34-0.36), respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.13 (CI, 3.60-4.66) and 0.70 (CI, 0.65-0.75), respectively. The meta-analyses had statistical and clinical heterogeneity ranging from 87.2% to 99.4%. Meta-regression analyses did not identify any significant explanation of the heterogeneity. We conclude that the prognostic value of the modified Mallampati score was worse than that estimated by previous meta-analyses. Our assessment shows that the modified Mallampati score is inadequate as a stand-alone test of a difficult laryngoscopy or tracheal intubation, but it may well be a part of a multivariate model for the prediction of a difficult tracheal intubation.",0,0

11049921,Cervical spine motion during airway management: a cinefluoroscopic study of the posteriorly destabilized third cervical vertebrae in human cadavers,"We conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover study to determine cervical spine motion for six airway management techniques in human cadavers with a posteriorly destabilized third cervical (C-3) vertebra. A destabilized C-3 segment was created in 10 cadavers (6-24 h postmortem). Cervical motion was recorded by continuous lateral fluoroscopy. The following airway management techniques were performed in random order on each cadaver with manual in-line stabilization applied: face mask ventilation (FM), laryngoscope-guided orotracheal intubation (OETT), fiberscope-guided nasal intubation (FOS-NETT), esophageal tracheal Combitube((R)) (Kendall-Sheridan, Neustadt, Germany) insertion (ETC), intubating laryngeal mask insertion with fiberscope-guided tracheal intubation (ILM-OETT), and laryngeal mask airway insertion (LMA). Afterward, maximum head-neck flexion (FLEX-MAX) and maximum head-neck extension (EXT-MAX) without manual in-line stabilization was performed to determine maximum motion. The maximum posterior displacement of C-3 and the maximum segmental sagittal motion of C2-3 were determined. There was a significant increase in posterior displacement for the FM (1.9 +/- 1.2 mm, P: < 0.01), OETT (2.6 +/- 1.6 mm, P: < 0.0001), ETC (3.2 +/- 1.6 mm, P: < 0.0001), ILM-OETT (1.7 +/- 1.3 mm, P: < 0. 01), LMA (1.7 +/- 1.3 mm, P: < 0.01), FLEX-MAX (3.7 +/- 1.9 mm, P: < 0.0001), EXT-MAX (1.8 +/- 1.7, P: < 0.01), however, not for FOS-NETT (0.1 +/- 0.7 mm). Posterior displacement was less for the ILM-OETT and LMA than for the ETC (both P: < 0.04). There were no significant increases in segmental sagittal motion with any airway manipulation other than with FLEX-MAX (-4.5 +/- 4.0 degrees, P: < 0.01). Posterior displacement was similar to FLEX-MAX for the OETT and ETC; however, it was less for the FM, FOS-NETT, ILM-OETT, and LMA (all P: < 0.01). Posterior displacement was similar to EXT-MAX for all airway manipulations other than for FOS-NETT (P: < 0.001). For cervical motion and the techniques tested, the safest method of airway management in a patient with a posteriorly destabilized C-3 segment is FOS-NETT. LMA devices may be preferable to the ETC. Implications: In the cadaver model of a destabilized third cervical vertebrae, significant displacement of the injured segment occurs during airway management with the face mask, laryngoscope-guided oral intubation, the esophageal tracheal Combitube (Kendall-Sheridan, Neustadt, Germany), the intubating and standard laryngeal mask airway; but not with fiberscope-guided nasal intubation. For cervical motion and the techniques tested, the safest airway technique with this injury is fiberscope-guided nasotracheal intubation. Laryngeal mask devices are preferable to the esophageal tracheal Combitube.",0,0
3768764,Esmolol for control of increases in heart rate and blood pressure during tracheal intubation after thiopentone and succinylcholine,"Esmolol, an ultra-short-acting cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, was investigated in a double-blind prospective protocol for its ability to control haemodynamic responses associated with tracheal intubation after thiopentone and succinylcholine. Thirty ASA physical status I patients received a 12-minute infusion of esmolol (500 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 for four minutes, then 300 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 for 8 minutes) or saline. Five minutes after the start of the drug/placebo infusion, anaesthesia was induced with 4 mg X kg-1 thiopentone followed by succinylcholine for tracheal intubation. Prior to induction esmolol produced significant decreases in heart rate (HR) (9.3 +/- 1.8 per cent) and rate-pressure product (RPP) (13.1 +/- 1.8 per cent), systolic blood pressure (SAP) (4.3 +/- 1.5 per cent) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (1.7 +/- 2.0 per cent). Increases in HR, SAP and RPP after intubation were approximately 50 per cent less in patients given esmolol compared to patients given placebo. There were highly significant differences in HR (p less than 0.0001), and RPP (p less than 0.0005) and significant differences in SAP (p less than 0.05) when the maximal esmolol post-intubation response was compared to the maximal placebo response. Infusion of esmolol in the dose utilized in this study significantly attenuated but did not completely eliminate cardiovascular responses to intubation.",0,0
22109754,Airway reconstruction in Wegener's granulomatosis-associated laryngotracheal stenosis,"Objectives/hypothesis: Open airway reconstruction is considered definitive treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS). Although most cases of LTS are not autoimmune, there are few data reported in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. In this study, we aimed to assess outcomes of airway reconstruction in LTS patients with Wegener's compared to nonautoimmune patients. Study design: Retrospective chart review of LTS cases managed with open airway reconstruction at an academic medical center. Methods: Patients who underwent open airway reconstruction for LTS due to Wegener's or nonautoimmune causes were identified from 1995 to 2010. Clinical, demographic, and procedural data were recorded. Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, and McNemar's test were used to test for significance. Results: A total of 53 patients were identified; eight Wegener's, 45 nonautoimmune, with median follow-up time of 8.3 and 1.8 years, respectively. Before reconstruction, there was no statistical difference between Wegener's and nonautoimmune patients with previous dilations (88% vs. 68%, P = .41) and tracheostomy dependence (50% vs. 42%, P = .72). Following reconstruction, 75% Wegener's and 36% nonautoimmune patients required further dilations (P = .05), with a decannulation rate of 75% and 58% (P = 1.0), respectively. Conclusions: Wegener's patients have an increased need for dilations after open airway reconstruction for LTS. However, these patients can be decannulated after surgery at a rate similar to patients with nonautoimmune LTS.",0,0
11493491,Manoeuvres used to clear the airway during fibreoptic intubation,"Fibreoptic orotracheal endoscopy under general anaesthesia may be more difficult to perform if the upper airway cannot be fully cleared. We have studied the effectiveness of jaw thrust, lingual traction and the application of both manoeuvres simultaneously, in opening up the orolaryngeal airspace in 30 ASA group 1 or 2 patients aged between 16 and 70 yr undergoing elective general surgery requiring orotracheal intubation. Airway clearance was assessed fibreoptically at soft palate level by observing whether or not the uvula or soft palate was apposed to the base of the tongue, and at epiglottic level by observing whether or not the epiglottis was apposed to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Lingual traction with Duval's forceps cleared the tongue away from the uvula and soft palate significantly more times than did jaw thrust (P<0.05). Jaw thrust cleared the epiglottis away from the posterior pharyngeal wall more frequently than did lingual traction (P=0.052). Applying both jaw thrust and lingual traction simultaneously cleared the airway at both soft palate and epiglottic level in every patient. When used alone, jaw thrust and lingual traction fail to produce full airway clearance in a significant number of patients. Combined jaw thrust and lingual traction clears the airway more effectively but requires two assistants.",0,0
19467824,[Mannequin-based simulation to evaluate difficult intubation training for emergency physicians],"Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate for the interest of realistic mannequin-based simulations as a tool to assess the knowledge of emergency medicine physicians in the field of difficult tracheal intubation. Study design: Prospective. Population: Emergency physicians. Methods: Twenty-four emergency physicians were invited entering the study. The first step of the study consisted of an initial assessment of their knowledge in the field of difficult tracheal intubation. Then theoretical lectures on the tools and techniques of difficult tracheal intubation were given, followed by standard mannequin-based driven workshops. The second step was conducted six weeks later. Each physician's knowledge was re-evaluated and their ability to manage two difficult airway scenarios simulated on the AirMan simulator (Laerdal was assessed. Results: Only one physician could not complete the program. Half of them worked at the University Hospital (UH) with half of them for less than three years. Lectures and standard mannequin-based driven workshops significantly improved physician's theoretical knowledge. Practical performance during difficult airway management scenarios was poor. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that theoretical lectures and standard mannequin-based driven workshops improved overall theoretical knowledge but did not translated to practical skill during of realistic mannequin-based simulations. Realistic mannequin-based simulations teaching programs in the field of difficult tracheal intubation should be considered.",0,0
23748552,"Incidences and predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia : a single-center analysis of 102,305 cases","Background: Hypoxemia caused by difficulties in airway management presents a major cause for perioperative morbidity and mortality. The ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy more accurately would enable anesthesiologists to take specific precautions to reduce airway risks and prevent patient-threatening events. Methods: Over a 6-year period of time, all anesthesia records with a documented direct laryngoscopic view were retrieved from the electronic data management system and statistically processed. The Cormack-Lehane four-point scale of grading laryngoscopy was used to assess visibility of the vocal cords. Results: Of 102,306 cases, the overall rate of difficult laryngoscopy was 4.9 %. Male gender (6.5 %), Mallampati score III and IV (17.3 %), obesity with a BMI ≥35 kg/m(2) (6.1 %), as well as physical status ASA III or IV (6.2 %), were identified as risk factors for difficult laryngoscopy. Patients undergoing surgery in the departments of oromaxillofacial (8.9 %), ear nose throat surgery (ENT) (7.4 %), and cardiac surgery (7.0 %) showed the highest rates of difficult laryngoscopy. Conclusions: The results indicate that the risk for difficult airway situations might substantially differ between surgical patient groups. In hospitals with departmental structures and spatially separated operating rooms, the deduction might be increased awareness and particular structural preparation for difficult airway situations in the respective subspecialties.",1,1
25265064,"Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor gene expression in liver cells is modulated by Ets-1 in synchrony with transcription factors Pax5, LEF-1 and c-Jun","Nuclear receptor PXR is predominantly expressed in liver and intestine. Expression of PXR is observed to be dysregulated in various metabolic disorders indicating its involvement in disease development. However, information available on mechanisms of PXR self-regulation is fragmentary. The present investigation identifies some of the regulatory elements responsible for its tight regulation and low cellular expression. Here, we report that the PXR-promoter is a target for some key transcription factors like PU.1/Ets-1, Pax5, LEF-1 and c-Jun. Interestingly, we observed that PXR-promoter responsiveness to Pax5, LEF-1 and c-Jun, is considerably enhanced by Ets transcription factors (PU.1 and Ets-1). Co-transfection of cells with Ets-1, LEF-1 and c-Jun increased PXR-promoter activity by 5-fold and also induced expression of endogenous human PXR. Site-directed mutagenesis and transfection studies revealed that two Ets binding sites and two of the three LEF binding sites in the PXR-promoter are functional and have a positive effect on PXR transcription. Results suggest that expression of Ets family members, in conjunction with Pax5, LEF-1 and c-Jun, lead to coordinated up-regulation of PXR gene transcription. Insights obtained on the regulation of PXR gene have relevance in offering important cues towards normal functioning as well as development of several metabolic disorders via PXR signaling.",0,0
11240886,A review of anaesthetic technique in 15 paediatric patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis,"Temporomandibular joint ankylosis presents a serious problem for airway management. This relatively rare problem becomes even more difficult to manage in children because of their smaller mouth opening with near total trismus, and the need for general anaesthesia before making any attempts to secure the airway. A technique for securing the airway that combines local blocks for nerves of larynx and topical anaesthesia of upper airways for placement of these blocks, and minimal general anaesthesia for these manoeuvres, is described. For general anaesthesia, a combination of halothane and ether by spontaneous ventilation, using bilateral nasopharyngeal airways, was used. Because of the severe trismus, a tongue depressor or tip of a laryngoscope was used with a fibreoptic light source in the buccal sulcus to visualize the tracheal tube in the pharynx. Nasal forceps, with a smaller tip and narrower blade than Magill forceps was used to guide the tracheal tube towards the air bubbles coming out of larynx. No attempt was made to visualize the larynx, but its position was guessed from the direction of these air bubbles. We review the anaesthetic technique in 15 such cases of severe trismus managed successfully between 1986 and 1999.",0,0
9743974,[Long-term results after modified Réthi-plasty in childhood],"Background: Laminotomy as described by Réthi has proved useful in the treatment of laryngotracheal stenoses. Using this technique in children poses the question as to whether it interferes with the growth of the larynx and trachea. The aim of our study was to verify the influence of this operative procedure on the structure and function of the restored airway. Patients: Fifteen children between the ages of 2 and 16 with severe laryngotracheal stenoses (Cotton Grade III and IV) underwent reconstruction with interposition of a piece of costal cartilage in the posterior cricoid plate. Indications for this procedure included the presence of severe circumferential subglottic stenosis in combination with stenosis of the posterior glottis (8 children) and complete atresia (4 children). Results: In endoscopic follow-up examinations (2-12 years follow-up), complete epithelization with light stenosis in the subglottis was demonstrated in all cases. Airway ventilation tests showed a slight or moderate central obstruction in nearly all cases. No disturbance of growth of the larynx was noted. Conclusions: This technique is a safe and successful method for repairing severe subglottic stenoses in children. Although there are some structural and functional problems during the long term follow-up, this is not considered a significant disadvantage.",0,0
16052126,Predicting difficult intubation in apparently normal patients: a meta-analysis of bedside screening test performance,"The objective of this study was to systematically determine the diagnostic accuracy of bedside tests for predicting difficult intubation in patients with no airway pathology. Thirty-five studies (50,760 patients) were selected from electronic databases. The overall incidence of difficult intubation was 5.8% (95% confidence interval, 4.5-7.5%). Screening tests included the Mallampati oropharyngeal classification, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, mouth opening, and Wilson risk score. Each test yielded poor to moderate sensitivity (20-62%) and moderate to fair specificity (82-97%). The most useful bedside test for prediction was found to be a combination of the Mallampati classification and thyromental distance (positive likelihood ratio, 9.9; 95% confidence interval, 3.1-31.9). Currently available screening tests for difficult intubation have only poor to moderate discriminative power when used alone. Combinations of tests add some incremental diagnostic value in comparison to the value of each test alone. The clinical value of bedside screening tests for predicting difficult intubation remains limited.",0,0
21719241,[Use of the Airtraq by inexperienced physicians supervised during a series of tracheal intubation in adult patient with anticipated difficult airway],"Introduction: The Airtraq optical laryngoscope (Vygon, Écouen, France) is a new intubation device designed to provide a view of the glottis without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. In recent literature, the efficiency of the Airtraq even in difficult intubation and its short learning curve were characterized. The goal of our study is to evaluate Airtraq efficiency when use by inexperienced physicians in anticipated difficult intubation adult patients. Methods: The patients showing at least one of the four difficult intubation predictors (history of difficult intubation, thyromental distance less than 60mm, mouth opening less than 35 mm and Mallampati class 3 or 4 were included. Before induction of anaesthesia, the inexperienced physicians participating the study received a short oral formation on the use of the Airtraq. For each intubation manoeuvres, the participant were supervised by an expert in Airtraq handling. The Cormack and Lehane grade of direct laryngoscopy view, the duration times to best glottis view and to intubate the trachea, the success or failure of tracheal intubation, the drop in arterial oxygen saturation of below 95%, the need for external manipulation, and the difficulties met by the operators were noted. Results: Twenty patients were included over a month period. Thirteen had a history of difficult intubation, eight a thyromental distance less than 60mm, nine a mouth opening less than 35 mm and 12 patients were classified as Mallampati IV. The success rate of tracheal intubation with the Airtraq laryngoscope was 80%. Times to best glottis view and to complete tracheal intubation were 28 and 47 s, respectively. Four tracheal intubation failures were encountered. The LMA Fastrach and the flexible fiberoscope were used respectively in one and three patients. Discussion: In the majority of the cases, the insertion of the Airtraq, the visualization of the glottis and the subsequent intubation were easy and rapid, without arterial oxygen desaturation. However, the four tracheal intubation failures associated with prolonged tracheal intubation times in some patients highlight the fact that the Airtraq laryngoscope requires a clinical training process particularly in case of anticipated difficult airway management situations.",0,0
7792414,[Intravenous anesthesia using propofol during lengthy neurosurgical interventions],"Objective: To compare the hemodynamic stability and time to recovery of consciousness after long-duration (> 3 h) neurosurgery with 2 anesthetic protocols: total intravenous anesthesia with propofol as the single hypnotic agent and inhalational anesthesia with isoflurane. Patients and method: We studied 58 middle-aged patients (range 40-50 years) scheduled for intracranial surgery. The patients, who all scored over 13 on the Glasgow coma scale before surgery, were randomly divided into two groups: 27 in group I received isoflurane and 31 in group II received propofol. Anesthetic induction was with sodium thiopental 4 mg/kg i.v. in group I and with propofol 2.5 mg/kg i.v. in group II. Both groups then received fentanyl 2 micrograms/kg i.v., lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg i.v. and vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg i.v. Before placement of the Mayfield head grip, with clamps, or before start of surgery in those cases in which the head grip was not used, all patients were given a 3 micrograms/kg i.v. dose of fentanyl. Hypnosis was maintained in group I with concentrations of isoflurane that were adequate for keeping minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) between 0.6 and 1. In group II maintenance was by continuous i.v. perfusion of propofol 10 mg/kg/h for 30 min., followed by 8 mg/kg/h for 30 min. and 6 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery. N2O was never used. Results: After induction systolic and mean arterial pressures (SAP and MAP) decreased significantly in both groups in comparison with baseline values (SAP: 113.1 +/- 30.0 vs. 140.9 +/- 27.08 mmHg in group I and 109.6 +/- 22.1 vs. 135.0 +/- 19.7 mmHg in group II; MAP: 76.8 +/- 18.7 vs. 95.6 +/- 17.0 mmHg in group I and 74.9 +/- 13.2 vs. 93.4 +/- 13.7 mmHg in group II). The patients in group II showed less tendency to develop arterial hypertension in response to orotracheal intubation (SAP and MAP at the moment of intubation: 156.4 +/- 33.7 and 104.6 +/- 18.1 mmHg, respectively, in group I as compared to 135.1 +/- 31.2 and 93.5 +/- 22.4 mmHg in group II; p < 0.05 between the 2 groups and p < 0.05 for the baseline and intubation pressures in group I). Time to recovery of effective, spontaneous breathing was shorter in group I (5.9 +/- 4.9 and 8.9 +/- 5.7 min.) than in group II (10.9 +/- 9.6 and 13.0 +/- 7.4 min.) and tubes could be extracted earlier from patients in the isoflurane group (10.4 +/- 6.1 min. vs. 17.6 +/- 12.8 min.; p < 0.01). We found no differences between the 2 groups for time until eye opening, response to verbal orders or time until start of spontaneous movement. Conclusions: Propofol can be considered an alternative to the traditional thiopental-isoflurane sequence in neurosurgery lasting more than 3 h. In our study the hypertensive response to the stimulus of orotracheal intubation was lower in the propofol group than in the thiopental-isoflurane group.",0,0
16095443,Inter-observer agreement of tests used for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy/tracheal intubation,"Background: Guidelines recommend pre-operative airway evaluation for the prediction of airway management difficulties. Combining tests for evaluation increases the accuracy of the assessment. One model including seven parameters transformed into a simplified airway risk index (SARI) has been proven to be valid. We determined the inter-observer agreement of the specific test combinations included in SARI as well as of the total score. Methods: Four observers assessed 136 patients, 120 without and 16 with a difficult airway history. Two residents and two specialists in anaesthesia performed the airway assessment consisting of the measurement of the mouth opening, the thyromental distance (TMD), the ability to protrude the mandible and an evaluation of the Mallampati class and head and neck mobility. Body weight was also recorded. Inter-observer agreement between specialists and residents, separately, was analysed using kappa statistics and Spearman's correlation analysis and the limits of agreement were evaluated using the 95% confidence interval. The agreement between pairs of assessors was also evaluated. Results: The inter-observer agreement was good to excellent for both specialists and residents when measuring mouth opening (Spearman's correlation coefficient R=0.88-0.97) and the horizontal distance between the upper and lower incisors during jaw protrusion (R=0.56-0.97). The Mallampati classification assessment demonstrated satisfactory to complete inter-observer agreement (kappa=0.41-1). The assessment of TMD and neck mobility showed considerable discrepancies between observers. Conclusions: We demonstrated good inter-observer agreement using three tests from SARI and recommend the Mallampati classification, mouth opening and ability of jaw protrusion for pre-operative airway evaluation. A simplification of the assessment of TMD and neck mobility is warranted.",0,0
9370848,The effect of a toothguard on the difficulty of intubation,"Dental damage is the most common reason for complaints against anaesthetists. The purpose of this study was to investigate the common belief that the use of a toothguard at the time of intubation causes intubation to be more difficult. We studied 80 patients, half of whom were intubated with a toothguard in situ and the other half intubated without a toothguard. The time taken from mouth opening to successful passage of the tracheal tube through the vocal cords was measured. In the toothguard group, the recorded time also included the time taken to insert the toothguard. The median time to intubation in the group with a toothguard was 24 s and the median time to intubation in the group without a toothguard was 17 s. The difference of 7 s in the time to intubation was statistically significant (p = 0.0003). As the recorded times also included the time taken to insert the toothguard, we do not regard this result to be clinically significant and believe that anaesthetists should think carefully before disregarding this simple protective device.",0,0
9366456,Pharyngeal patency in response to advancement of the mandible in obese anesthetized persons,"Background: During anesthesia in humans, anterior displacement of the mandible is often helpful to relieve airway obstruction. However, it appears to be less useful in obese patients. The authors tested the possibility that obesity limits the effectiveness of the maneuver. Methods: Total muscle paralysis was induced under general anesthesia in a group of obese persons (n = 9; body mass index, 32 +/- 3 kg[-2]) and in a group of nonobese persons (n = 9; body mas index, 21 +/- 2 kg[-2]). Nocturnal oximetry confirmed that none of them had sleep-disordered breathing. The cross-sectional area of the pharynx was measured endoscopically at different static airway pressures. A static pressure-area plot allowed assessment of the mechanical properties of the pharynx. The influence of mandibular advancement on airway patency was assessed by comparing the static pressure-area relation with and without the maneuver in obese and nonobese persons. Results: Mandibular advancement increased the retroglossal area at a given pharyngeal pressure, and mandibular advancement increased the retropalatal area in nonobese but not in obese persons at a given pharyngeal pressure. Conclusion: Mandibular advancement did not improve the retropalatal airway in obese persons.",0,0

20963342,Nasal obstruction and high Mallampati score as risk factors for Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Respiratory sleep disorders are strongly associated with upper airway patency. Nasal obstruction is associated with higher incidences of sleep apnea, primarily by increasing the negative pressure on the airway during inspiration. Aims: To evaluate the influence of nasal obstruction in the worsening of sleep apnea in patients with OSA and a high score on the modified classification of Mallampati. Materials and methods: We evaluated and classified 206 patients complaining of snoring, and with a past suggestive of OSA through the Modified Mallampati score, Friedman, nasal obstruction and the severity of OSA by AHI. Results: 168 patients who underwent polysomnography were included. Cross-plotting was made comparing the modified Mallampati score, nasal obstruction and AIH. The odds ratio between high Mallampati score and AHI was OR = 5.053, 95% CI = 1.458 to 7.517 (p = 0.0071). High Mallampati score associated with nasal obstruction was correlated with OSAS (p = 0.0227). However the influence of nasal obstruction on the relationship of high Mallampati score and OSA was not significant: OR = 2.850, 95% CI = 0.992 to 8.189. Conclusion: The combination of high Mallampati score and nasal obstruction represents a greater risk factor for worsening of OSA.",0,0
16717341,A systematic review (meta-analysis) of the accuracy of the Mallampati tests to predict the difficult airway,"The original and modified Mallampati tests are commonly used to predict the difficult airway, but there is controversy regarding their accuracy. We searched MEDLINE and other databases for prospective studies of patients undergoing general anesthesia in which the results of a preoperative Mallampati test were compared with the subsequent rate of difficult airway (difficult laryngoscopy, difficult intubation, or difficult ventilation as reference tests). Forty-two studies enrolling 34,513 patients were included. The definitions of the reference tests varied widely. For predicting difficult laryngoscopy, both versions of the Mallampati test had good accuracy (area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve = 0.89 +/- 0.05 and 0.78 +/- 0.05, respectively). For predicting difficult intubation, the modified Mallampati test had good accuracy (area under the sROC curve = 0.83 +/- 0.03) whereas the original Mallampati test was poor (area under the sROC curve = 0.58 +/- 0.12). The Mallampati tests were poor at identifying difficult mask ventilation. Publication bias was not detected. Used alone, the Mallampati tests have limited accuracy for predicting the difficult airway and thus are not useful screening tests.",0,0
9743852,Screening tests for predicting difficult intubation. A clinical assessment in Turkish patients,"Three methods of predicting difficult intubation were compared prospectively. Mallampati test, Wilson risk-sum and thyromental distance were determined preoperatively and laryngeal views were graded in 500 patients. The sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values of each test were calculated. The incidence of difficult intubation was found to be 8%. The sensitivities of the Mallampati test, the Wilson risk-sum and the thyromental distance were 43%, 58% and 35% respectively, and the specificities were 93%, 91% and 95% respectively. Significant differences were seen between the sensitivities of the Mallampati test and the Wilson risk-sum (P < 0.001), the Wilson risk-sum and the thyromental distance (P < 0.001), the Mallampati test and the thyromental distance (P < 0.05). Among the different specificities, the only significant difference was observed between the Wilson risk-sum and the thyromental distance (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the positive and negative predictive values of the three screening tests (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the Wilson risk-sum was the most sensitive test and the thyromental distance has the highest positive predictive value for difficult intubation.",1,1
16862681,The Thai Anesthesia Incidents Study (THAI Study) of anesthetic outcomes: I. Description of methods and populations,"Background and rationale: Since anesthesia, unlike medical or surgical specialties, does not constitute treatment, The Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand host the Thai Anesthesia Incidents Study (THAI Study) of anesthetic outcomes to determine factors related to anesthesia related adverse events. Material and method: A prospective descriptive study of occurrence screening was conducted in 20 hospitals comprised of 7 university, 4 general and 4 district hospitals across Thailand. Anesthesia personnels were required to fill up patient-related, surgical-related, anesthesia-related variables and adverse outcomes on a strutured data entry form. The data included preanesthetic evaluation intraoperative period and 24 hr postoperative period. Adverse events specific form was recorded when adverse events occurred. All data were keyed in data management unit with double entry technique and descriptive statistics was used in the first phase of this study. Results: A total of 163403 consecutive cases were recorded in one year. The mean (S.D.) of age, weight and height of patients were 38.6(2.3) yrs, 53.9(17.7) kgs and 153.4(22.7) cm respectively. There were more female (52.9%) than male (47. 1%) patients with ASA PS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = 50.8%, 36.3%, 10.7%, 2.0%, 0.2% respectively. Hypertension (11.6%), anemia (7.7%) and diabetes melitus (6.8%) were the three most common abnormalities in preanesthetic history taking. Mallampati score of 111870 patients grade 1, 2, 3, 4 were 54.0%, 39.7%, 5.6%, 0.7% and laryngoscopic grade 1, 2, 3, 4 of 74888 patients were 81.0%, 15.5%, 3.0% and 0.5% respectively. Conclusion: The first phase of THAI study epidemiological project can represent both the anesthesia and surgical profiles in Thailand. The collected data available should be useful for the improvement of the quality of anesthesia, guidelines for clinical practices, medical education and for further research.",0,0
15562892,"Analysis of recurrences in 322 Tis, T1, or T2 glottic carcinomas treated by carbon dioxide laser","An endoscopic approach to early glottic carcinoma is considered a sound treatment for both previously untreated lesions and selected recurrent lesions. Between January 1988 and December 2000, we treated 322 patients by CO2 laser at a single institution; 37 had Tis, 191 T1a, 55 T1b, and 39 T2 lesions (mean follow-up, 77 months; range, 6 to 180 months). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a 5-year overall survival rate of 88%, a determinate survival rate of 99%, a disease-free survival rate of 81%, a rate of ultimate local control with laser alone of 91%, and a laryngeal preservation rate of 97%. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that the only factor that statistically affected endoscopic control was lateral extension of the tumor with involvement of the bottom of the ventricle (hazard risk ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.71 to 9.35). The 58 recurrences were classified according to their location compared with the site of the primary tumor as follows: 14 in the same area (group A), 27 in adjacent subsites with superficial spreading or multifocal distribution (group B), and 17 in adjacent sites by submucosal diffusion to the visceral spaces, cartilaginous framework, or extralaryngeal tissues (group C). For each group, we analyzed the rate of patients who underwent salvage by endoscopic or open neck procedures and the rate of laryngeal preservation. Recurrences in groups A and B were endoscopically treated in 86% and 74% of cases, respectively. By contrast, in group C no patient was endoscopically cured, and there was a low laryngeal preservation rate (47%). The pathways of spread in recurrent carcinoma are therefore the single most important factor in predicting its endoscopic curability.",0,0

16296354,[Usefullness of bronchofiberscopy for difficult intubation in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities],"In 21 patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities, bronchofiberoptic intubation was performed because of difficulty in tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy. The patients ranged from 3 to 35 years old (mean age: 20.2 years). Twenty patients (95.2%) were bedridden. Among the 21 patients, 15 had cerebral palsy and 20 had hypertonia. The reason for intubation were acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia in 17 cases, suffocation after aspiration of food in 2 cases, hypovolemic shock in 1 case, and laryngotracheomalacia in 1 case. Intubation was done pernasally in 15 patients and perorally in 10. It was successful in 20 cases without any significant complications. The Cormack score ranged from 3rd degree in 4 cases to 4th in 17 cases. The 20 cases of successful fiberoptic intubation were divided into 7 patients with and 13 without tracheostomy. The mortality rate was 14.3% in patients with tracheostomy and 30.8% in those without tracheostomy. When more than 4 intubation trials were needed, there was a significantly higher mortality rate. In neurologically handicapped patients with deformity or hypertonia of the oral, cervical, or airway structures, a bronchofiberoptic procedure may be recommended when there is difficulty with intubation.",0,0
25431308,"Difficult intubation in obese patients: incidence, risk factors, and complications in the operating theatre and in intensive care units","Background: Intubation procedure in obese patients is a challenging issue both in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the operating theatre (OT). The objectives of the study were (i) to compare the incidence of difficult intubation and (ii) its related complications in obese patients admitted to ICU and OT. Methods: We conducted a multicentre prospective observational cohort study in ICU and OT in obese (BMI≥30 kg m(-2)) patients. The primary endpoint was the incidence of difficult intubation. Secondary endpoints were the risk factors for difficult intubation, the use of difficult airway management techniques, and severe life-threatening complications related to intubation (death, cardiac arrest, severe hypoxaemia, severe cardiovascular collapse). Results: In cohorts of 1400 and 11 035 consecutive patients intubated in ICU and in the OT, 282 (20%) and 2103 (19%) were obese. In obese patients, the incidence of difficult intubation was twice more frequent in ICU than in the OT (16.3% vs 8.2%, P<0.01). In both cohorts, risk factors for difficult intubation were Mallampati score III/IV, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, and reduced mobility of cervical spine, while limited mouth opening, severe hypoxaemia, and coma appeared only in ICU. Specific difficult airway management techniques were used in 66 (36%) cases of difficult intubation in obese patients in the OT and in 10 (22%) cases in ICU (P=0.04). Severe life-threatening complications were significantly more frequent in ICU than in the OT (41.1% vs 1.9%, relative risk 21.6, 95% confidence interval 15.4-30.3, P<0.01). Conclusions: In obese patients, the incidence of difficult intubation was twice more frequent in ICU than in the OT and severe life-threatening complications related to intubation occurred 20-fold more often in ICU.

23917749,Predicting difficult airway in apparently normal adult and pediatric patients,"The aim of the study was to determine the predicting tests for difficult airway and difficult intubation in apparently normal patients. Methods: We were using the literature about the specific tests for predicting difficult airway and single parameters that could be a significant test for prediction of difficult or impossible intubation. Clinical risk factors for difficult intubation in pediatric patients are related to the anatomic differences between pediatric patients and adults. Quantitative evaluation of difficult intubations could be realized using Cormack-Lehane (CL) scale and Mallampati score (without speaking--Mallampati test--and modified Mallampati test during speech). The Cormack-Lehane (CL) scale is a grading system commonly used to describe the view of the larynx during direct laryngoscopy. Grades 3 and 4, in which the glottis is not visualized, are considered difficult intubations. The Mallampati score, estimates the size of the tongue relative to the oral cavity and the ability to open the mouth. This system graded the patient (grades 1 to 4) based on the structures visible in the oropharynx with maximal mouth opening. Grade 3 or 4 suggests a significant chance that the patient will be difficult to intubate. Results: Our results showed that 24 patients (20 adult patients and 4 pediatric patients), 3.2% from total of 750 involved in the study had difficult intubation (Mallampati grades 3 and 4). 35% of the patients had impaired glottis exposure (grades 3 and 4 of the Cormack-Lehane scale). Conclusion: We used only two criteria for describing both the visibility of the oropharyngeal structures and the quality of the laryngeal view. The effective and reliable prediction requires a combination of several parameters (BMI, head and neck movement, dentition status, upper lip bite test, interincisor gap and thyromental distance).",0,0
25158992,Comparison of intubation performance by emergency medicine residents using gum elastic bougie versus standard stylet in simulated easy and difficult intubation scenarios,"Objective: We sought to evaluate the success rate and time to endotracheal intubation by emergency medicine residents with stylet reinforced endotracheal tube (ETT-S) versus intubation with a gum elastic bougie (GEB) in simulated easy and difficult airways on a cadaveric model. Methods: The study was a prospective cross-over design using a cohort of 29 emergency medicine residents. A fresh frozen cadaver was used in either standard positioning to facilitate a Cormack Lehane Grade 1 laryngoscopy, or with a hard cervical collar applied a Cormack Lehane Grade 3 laryngoscopy. Each participant then intubated the cadaver in each setting. The primary end-point of our investigation was the time to intubation. Secondary end-points were: success rate of intubation, mean ratings by study participants of perceived ease of intubation for each intubation technique in each simulated degree of difficulty, and overall preference of intubation technique in each simulated degree of difficulty. Results: Mean time to intubation in all scenarios ranged from 28.8-116.6 s. Time to intubation was significantly different only when comparing Grade 3 ETT-S to Grade 3 GEB. There was no significant difference in success rate when comparing Grade 1 ETT-S to Grade 1 GEB (P = 0.99) nor Grade 3 ETT-S to Grade 3 GEB (P = 0.21). Conclusion: Time to intubation in a simulated grade 3 view was significantly longer in the GEB group versus the ETT-S group. Although the differences in success rates were not statistically significant, there was a trend toward more successful intubations with the GEB in the simulated grade 3 view.",0,0

We believe regional blocks combined with extensive topical anesthesia aid in the successful use of the fiberoptic laryngoscope for cases of difficult intubation in the practice of oral surgery. We were unable to obtain a complete sensory block with benzocaine or lidocaine spray since the mouth opening was less tha 1 mm. The bilateral superior laryngeal nerve block is a valuable adjunct to the procedure.",0,0
18710018,[Use of gum elastic bougie for tracheal intubation: comparison of different tracheal tubes],"Background: Gum elastic bougie (GEB) is one of the most useful devices for patients whose tracheas are difficult to intubate during anesthetic induction. But no previous study has evaluated the effects of the types of the tracheal tube. We hypothesized that wire-reinforced tracheal tubes were superior to standard tracheal tubes in the success rate of tracheal intubation when using GEB. We compared these two different types of tracheal tubes in using GEB. Methods: Forty patients were subjected and randomly allocated into two groups; patients intubated with standard tracheal tubes (Group , n = 20) and those with wire-reinforced tracheal tubes (Group S, n = 20). Measured variables were intubation time defined as elapsed time from mouth opening to removal of GEB from tracheal tube, heart rate (HR), and systolic blood pressure(SBP). We also compared trial times of intubation and pharyngeal or laryngeal bleeding as a minor side effect. Results: Trachea was successfully intubated in the frist attempt in 37 patients (92.5%), and the rest of the patients were all intubated at second trial. Intubation times of Group P and Group S were 41.5 +/- 13.9s and 41.3 +/- 11.1s, respectively. There were no significant differences in HR and SBP between the groups. Conclusions: The type of tracheal tube would not affect the success rate and time of intubation when using gum elastic bougie.",0,0
11194979,Clinical comparison of either small doses of fentanyl or remifentanil for blunting cardiovascular changes induced by tracheal intubation,"Background: To compare in a prospective, randomized study the effects on cardiovascular changes after tracheal intubation produced by small doses of either remifentanil or fentanyl. Methods: With Ethical Committee approval, after intravenous midazolam premedication (0.05 mg.kg-1), 30 normotensive, ASA physical status I-II patients, without cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, and with a Mallampati score < 2, were randomly allocated to receive an intravenous bolus of either 3 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl (n = 15) or 1 microgram.kg-1 remifentanil (n = 15) infused over 60 sec and followed by a 0.15 microgram.kg-1.min-1 continuous intravenous infusion. General anesthesia was then induced with propofol (2 mg.kg-1), followed by atracurium besilate (0.5 mg.kg-1) to facilitate tracheal intubation. Following intubation, the lungs were ventilated mechanically using a 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen mixture with a 1% inspired fraction of sevoflurane. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before anesthesia induction (baseline), one minute after induction of anesthesia, immediately after tracheal intubation and every minute for the first five minutes after intubation. Results: Systolic arterial blood pressure values were significantly higher in the Fentanyl than in the Remifentanil group patients from 2 to 5 min after tracheal intubation (p < 0.01), while no differences were observed between the two groups in either diastolic arterial blood pressure or heart rate values. Four patients in the Remifentanil group (26%) but only one patient in the Fentanyl group (7%) showed systolic blood pressure values < 90 mmHg during the study period (p = not significant); however, the observed decreases in systolic arterial blood pressure values were transient and did not require treatment for any subject. Conclusion: We conclude that in healthy normotensive patients, the control of cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation obtained with a 1 microgram.kg-1 loading dose of remifentanil is more effective than that provided by a 3 micrograms.kg-1 bolus of fentanyl, with the advantage of no risks for postoperative respiratory depression.",0,0
21324124,Modified Mallampati classification as a clinical predictor of peroral esophagogastroduodenoscopy tolerance,"Background: Unsedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is simpler and safer than sedated EGD; however, approximately 40% of patients cannot tolerate it. Early identification of patients likely to poorly tolerate unsedated EGD is valuable for improving compliance. The modified Mallampati classification (MMC) has been used to evaluate difficult tracheal intubation and laryngoscope insertion. We tried to assess the efficacy of MMC to predict the tolerance of EGD in unsedated patients. Methods: Two hundred patients who underwent an unsedated diagnostic EGD were recruited. They were stratified according to the view of the oropharynx as either MMC class I + II (good view) or class III + IV (poor view). EGD tolerance was assessed in three ways: gag reflex by endoscopist assessment, patient satisfaction by interview, and the degree of change in vital signs. Results: MMC was significantly correlated to gag reflex (P < 0.001), patient satisfaction (P = 0.028), and a change of vital signs (P = 0.024). Patients in the poor view group had a 3.87-fold increased risk of gag reflex (P < 0.001), a 1.78-fold increased risk of unsatisfaction (P = 0.067), and a 1.96-fold increased risk of a change in vital signs (P = 0.025) compared to those in the good view group. Conclusions: MMC appears to be a clinically useful predictor of EGD tolerance. Patients with poor view of oropharynx by MMC criteria may be candidates for sedated or transnasal EGD.",0,0
17572046,"[""Difficult intubation"" workshops : impact on knowledge and practices]","Objectives: To evaluate the impact of difficult intubation workshops on airway management knowledge and daily medical practice in anaesthesiology. Study design: Prospective survey. Methods: The participants to the workshops accredited by the French college of anaesthesiologists (Cfar) in 2003 were invited to answer to MCQ before, immediately and three months after the course. They also completed a questionnaire provided during the workshop and three months later, focusing on medical practice and their own organization in the area of difficult intubation before and after the workshop. Results: One hundred seven participants responded to the immediate evaluation (MCQ and questionnaire) whereas 32 responded to the delayed evaluation performed three months later. A subjective scale was used to assess the level of knowledge in difficult intubation (0: lowest level, 10 highest level). The mean score for subjective knowledge considering difficult intubation was 4.7+/-2.3 before the course and 6.9+/-1.6 at 3 months (P<0.001). The mean scores attributed to MCQ were not different before and after the workshops. Participants expected complementary practical training (65%) and theoretical courses (40%). Delayed evaluation revealed that 25/32 participants had to deal with difficult intubation during their clinical practice after the workshop, but 3 cases (12%) could not be managed with success. Defects could be observed in terms of organization: no difficult airway trolley (22%), no predefined difficult airway algorithm (66%), and information: no written information given to the difficult airway patient (44%), and no information given to the difficult airway patient's home doctor (91%). Discussion: These results showed that difficult intubation remains a real problem for anaesthesiologists.

17697222,"Comparison of the Airway Scope, gum elastic bougie and fibreoptic bronchoscope in simulated difficult tracheal intubation: a manikin study","We compared the Airway Scope with a gum elastic bougie and fibreoptic bronchoscope in a manikin with a simulated Cormack and Lehane Grade 3 laryngoscopic view. Twenty-seven anaesthetists intubated the trachea of the manikin with these devices and the time required for intubation was measured. They were then asked to rate the subjective difficulty of intubation (1 = very easy; 5 = very difficult). Mean (SD) intubation times were 16.6 (11.2) s with the Airway Scope, 29.4 (10.9) s with the gum elastic bougie (p < 0.0001), and 30.6 (20.0) s with the fibreoptic bronchoscope (p < 0.0001). The median (range) difficulty was 2 (1-4) with the Airway Scope, 3 (2-4) with the gum elastic bougie (p < 0.001), and 2 (1-5) with the fibreoptic bronchoscope (p = 0.014).

25123374,Atraumatic intubation: experience using a 5.0 endotracheal tube without a stylet for laryngeal surgery,"Objectives/hypothesis: Vocal fold injury is a well-know complication of intubation, with rates reported as high as 69%. Laryngology textbooks recommend the use of a small endotracheal tube (ETT) to help avoid these complications and optimize visualization. Case reports have suggested that the rigid stylet can lead to laryngeal injury. Given the additional risks, intubation without the stylet is our preferred practice. There is limited documentation in the literature regarding this viewpoint. Our study investigated the feasibility of and potential barriers to intubation using 5.0 ETT without a stylet. Study design: Prospective study. Methods: Consecutive adult patients undergoing laryngeal surgery were recruited for intubation with a 5.0 ETT without a stylet. Demographic data, specialty and training level of the intubator, and factors that would predict a difficult intubation were recorded. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Results: Findings of the participants (n = 67) included average American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (2.2), average Mallampati score (1.7), average Cormack-Lehane grade (1.5), and average body mass index (28.0). Five patients (7.4%) required intubation using a stylet, and one of these five participants was intubated initially with a stylet. Of these five participants, 80% required use of a GlideScope (P < .001), and they had significantly higher ASA classification (P = .047) and number of intubation attempts (P = .042). One patient sustained an oropharyngeal injury during intubation with a stylet. No participants had laryngeal injury. Conclusions: Most patients can be intubated successfully using a 5.0 ETT without a stylet. There were no cases of laryngeal trauma with this technique. Level of evidence: 2b.",0,0

His past medical history included childhood nasolabial rhabdomyosarcoma treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This had resulted in marked abnormalities of the facial skeleton, limited neck extension and restricted mouth opening of 1 cm, in part due to dental implants. After careful discussion and planning within a multidisciplinary team, the airway was optimised by temporary removal of the dental implants.

19445719,Comparison of the Glidescope and Pentax AWS laryngoscopes to the Macintosh laryngoscope for use by advanced paramedics in easy and simulated difficult intubation,"Background: Intubation of the trachea in the pre-hospital setting may be lifesaving in severely ill and injured patients. However, tracheal intubation is frequently difficult to perform in this challenging environment, is associated with a lower success rate, and failed tracheal intubation constitutes an important cause of morbidity. Novel indirect laryngoscopes, such as the Glidescope and the AWS laryngoscopes may reduce this risk. Methods: We compared the efficacy of these devices to the Macintosh laryngoscope when used by 25 Advanced Paramedics proficient in direct laryngoscopy, in a randomized, controlled, manikin study. Following brief didactic instruction with the Glidescope and the AWS laryngoscopes, each participant took turns performing laryngoscopy and intubation with each device, in an easy intubation scenario and following placement of a hard cervical collar, in a SimMan manikin. Results: Both the Glidescope and the AWS performed better than the Macintosh, and demonstrate considerable promise in this context. The AWS had the least number of dental compressions in all three scenarios, and in the cervical spine immobilization scenario it required fewer maneuvers to optimize the view of the glottis. Conclusion: The Glidescope and AWS devices possess advantages over the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope when used by Advanced Paramedics in normal and simulated difficult intubation scenarios in this manikin study.

We investigated the impact of a new assessment form on airway prediction and management by anaesthesia residents. We hypothesized that residents would demonstrate improvement in evaluation of DAs over the study duration. Methods: After IRB approval, anaesthesia residents were randomized into two groups: control (existing form) and experimental (new form). Data were collected prospectively from August 2008 to May 2010 on all non-obstetric adult patients undergoing non-emergent surgery. Results: Eight thousand three hundred and sixty-four independent preoperative assessments were collected and 8075 were analysed. The experimental group had the higher completion rate than the control group (94.3% vs 84.3%, P=0.001). DA prediction was higher for the control group (71.2%) compared with the experimental group (69.1%; P=0.032). A significant improvement in prediction rates was found over time for the experimental group (likelihood estimate=0.00068, P=0.031).

16828692,Consequences of under- and over-humidification,"Respiratory mucosal and lung structures and functions may be severely impaired in mechanically ventilated patients when delivered gases are not adequately conditioned. Although under- and over-humidification of respiratory gases have not been defined clearly, a safe range of temperature and humidity may be suggested. During mechanical ventilation, gas entering the trachea should reach at least physiologic conditions (32 degrees C-34 degrees C and 100%relative humidity) to keep the ISB at its normal location. Clinicians must keep in mind that relative humidity is more important than absolute humidity: the warmer the gas, the higher the risk of tracheal mucosa dehydration and proximal airway obstruction. Practical assessment of the adequacy of the humidification system in use is not easy. The consistency (thin, moderate, or thick) of the patient's sputum should be evaluated regularly [47]. Full saturation of inspiratory gases is likely when water condensation is observed in the flex tube [91,92]. Nevertheless, no clinical parameter is accurate enough to detect all the effects of inadequate conditioning [45]. When mechanical ventilation is extended beyond several days, adequate conditioning of respiratory gases becomes increasingly crucial to prevent retention of secretions and to maximize mucociliary function; a requirement that respiratory gases reach at least physiologic conditions is appropriate.",0,0

This study was conducted using patients diagnosed with OSAS between January 2007 and March 2009, who were scheduled for surgical treatment. DISE was performed using propofol in patients considered to have upper respiratory tract obstruction as indicated by Muller's maneuver. After completing the sleep endoscopy, the patient was intubated and surgery was performed (tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty). A successful operation was defined as a decrease in the respiratory disturbance index to below 5 or a decrease of ≥50 % following the operation. The study included 20 patients (4 female and 16 male) aged 19-57 years. No statistically significant correlation between modified Mallampati class and operation success or between the polysomnographic stage of disease and operation success was identified. A significantly high operation success rate was found in the group with obstruction of the upper airway according to DISE (p < 0.05), whereas a significantly low operation success rate was found in the group with obstruction of the lower airway according to DISE (p < 0.01).

Evaluation consisted of clinical assessment and tidal breathing flow volume loop and upper airway resistance measurements. Carbon dioxide and doxapram hydrochloride were used as respiratory stimulants. Initially, all dogs improved clinically after corrective surgery. However, by the end of the study, laryngeal collapse had developed in 2 of 5 dogs corrected by ventral ventriculocordectomy. No statistical differences in upper airway mechanics testing were seen between the surgical procedures. With both groups combined, many measurements of upper airway obstruction improved after surgical correction. Based on this study, these surgical procedures yield comparable results, although additional studies are needed to evaluate both the cause of laryngeal collapse and the role of upper airway mechanics testing in the evaluation of canine laryngeal paralysis.",0,0
25062573,The best method to predict easy intubation: a quasi-experimental pilot study,"Purpose: To facilitate evaluation of the airway before endotracheal intubation, different scores have been developed, mainly to predict difficult airways. However, in anesthesia clinical practice in Sweden, scores would be more useful if they could also predict an easy airway, so that the correct category of anesthesia personnel can be allocated. Therefore, we evaluated whether scoring systems commonly used to predict difficult airways could also predict easy endotracheal intubation. Design: This prospective observational study included patients who were scheduled for general anesthesia and required endotracheal intubation. Methods: Airways were evaluated preoperatively by two independent variables, namely Mallampati classification and thyromental distance. After anesthesia induction, the Cormack and Lehane grade was assessed. Finding: Mallampati scores yielded the highest specificity in predicting easy intubation, and Cormack and Lehane grades yielded the highest positive predictive value for predicting easy intubation. Conclusions: Mallampati classification is an appropriate screening test for predicting easy intubation.",1,1
11713917,Deep neck abscess: a retrospective review of 210 cases,"This study was performed to review our experience with deep neck abscesses (DNAs) and compare it to the experiences in the available literature, and to study changing trends within our patient population. We retrospectively studied 210 patients who had DNAs between 1981 and 1998. Peritonsillar abscesses and limited intraoral abscesses were excluded. Demographics, presentation, etiology, site of abscess, associated systemic diseases, bacteriology, radiology, treatment, airway management, and outcome were reviewed. We compared the entire group to those in the available literature and studied changing trends within this patient population. Dental infection (43%) was the most common cause, followed by intravenous drug abuse (12%) and pharyngotonsillitis (6%). The incidences of intravenous drug abuse and mandibular fractures as causes of DNA were 19% and 8%, respectively, during the period 1981 to 1990, but were only 1% each during the period 1991 to 1998. Streptococcus viridans was the most common pathogen (39% of positive cultures), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (22%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%). Lateral pharyngeal space abscess was the most common DNA (43%), followed by submandibular space abscess, Ludwig's angina, and retropharyngeal space abscess (28%, 17%, and 12%, respectively). Seventy-five percent of patients with true Ludwig's angina underwent tracheotomy. Nondental infections are no longer a significant etiologic factor in DNA. Streptococcus viridans has replaced S aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci as the most common pathogen. Lateral pharyngeal space abscess was the most common DNA; however, its incidence has progressively decreased over the past decade. Intravenous drug abuse and mandibular fractures are no longer major etiologic factors. Tracheotomy is indicated in patients with Ludwig's angina.",0,0
8435172,Endoscopic assessment in children with tracheotomies,"Pediatric tracheotomy is a safe procedure, and the tube can be maintained for a prolonged period. There are, however, few guidelines regarding the endoscopic assessment of the airway following tracheotomy. From January 1988 through December 1989, the Division of Otolaryngology of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Pa) performed tracheotomies on 81 patients. Thirty-two children had direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy at the time of the procedure, 1 week later, and at 6-month intervals for a minimum of 18 months. Four children had normal airways while 21 had intraluminal stomal granulomas, 16 had development of subglottic stenosis, nine had collapse of the anterior tracheal wall, and three had development of distal tracheal granulations. Sixteen children had multiple lesions. Anatomic changes occur in the airways of the majority of children with long-term tracheotomies, and endoscopic evaluation is an essential part of their care.",0,0
9536837,Deformation of the palate in preterm infants,"Aim: To investigate the effect of gestation, postmenstrual age, and orotracheal intubation on palate morphology. Methods: A prospective study was made of 76 newborn infants of 25 to 41 weeks' gestation. Palate dimensions were measured on plaster models produced from serial palatal impressions. Palate size relative to that of the mouth was assessed using a ratio of palate depth to palate width (Palatal Index). Results: Palate depth and width were related to postmenstrual age and gestation. Palatal Index ranged from 0.15 to 0.57, indicating a wide variation in palate shape, but gestation and postmenstrual age had no effect. Prolonged intubation had a small effect, equivalent to an increase in palatal depth of less than 2 mm at 32 weeks' postmenstrual age. The effect was transient. Conclusion: Prolonged orotracheal intubation (> 10 days) leads to a small and temporary increase in palatal depth. However, this is unlikely to account for palatal grooving, which is probably caused by an overgrowth of the lateral palatine ridges.",0,0
18165588,Subcutaneous cervical and facial emphysema with the use of the Bonfils fiberscope and high-flow oxygen insufflation,"We present a case in which use of the Bonfils retromolar intubation fiberscope resulted in cervical and facial subcutaneous emphysema. The patient was a 75-yr-old woman with Mallampati Grade I airway. The Bonfils retromolar intubation fiberscope was used for teaching purposes. Flow on the oxygen port of the fiberscope was set at 10 L/min. Immediately after insertion of the scope, her whole face and cervical skin showed severe subcutaneous emphysema. The patient was intubated conventionally and the emphysema resolved within 24 h. Subcutaneous emphysema after air insufflation is known from dental procedures with air entering through holes in the teeth. In our case, the oxygen insufflation was sufficient to create emphysema, probably through tiny mucosal lesions.",0,0

18405410,Does left molar approach to laryngoscopy make difficult intubation easier than the conventional midline approach?,"Background and objective: It has been reported that the left molar approach of laryngoscopy can make difficult intubation easier. The aim of this study was to investigate whether left molar approach to laryngoscopy provided a better laryngeal view in cases of unexpected difficult intubation. Methods: Following the approval of local Ethics Committee and written informed consent from the patients, out of 1386 patients who underwent general anaesthesia for surgery, 20 patients who could be ventilated by face mask but could not be intubated with conventional midline approach on the first attempt were included in the study. Those 20 patients, who had Grade III-IV laryngeal views on laryngoscopy by conventional midline approach, were subjected to left molar laryngoscopy, and their laryngeal views were evaluated. The external laryngeal compression was routinely used to improve the laryngeal view. When endotracheal intubation failed by left molar laryngoscopy, we performed the conventional midline approach again. All data were recorded. Results: Of the 20 patients studied, 18 had a Grade III laryngeal view and two had a Grade IV laryngeal view. Eighteen of them had a better laryngeal view with left molar laryngoscopy. Eleven of the 20 patients underwent successful intubation with the left molar laryngoscopy, which provided a significantly better laryngeal view and success rate of tracheal intubation than did the conventional midline approach (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). Conclusions: Left molar laryngoscopy can make unexpected difficult intubation easier and should be attempted in cases of difficult intubation.",0,0
18617389,Difficult and failed intubation in obstetric anaesthesia: an observational study of airway management and complications associated with general anaesthesia for caesarean section,"Background: Recent developments in anaesthesia and patient demographics have potentially changed the practice of obstetric general anaesthesia. There are few contemporary data on Australasian practice of general anaesthesia for caesarean section, especially relating to airway management, anaesthetic techniques and complications. Methods: Using a standardised case record form, a prospective observational study was conducted during 2005-06 in 13 maternity hospitals dealing with approximately 49 500 deliveries per annum. Patient demographics, airway management, anaesthetic techniques and major complications were evaluated in those given general anaesthesia. Results: Data were obtained from 1095 women receiving general anaesthesia for caesarean section, 47% of which were classified as category 1 and 18% as category 4. Tracheal intubation was planned in all cases with rapid-sequence induction used in 97%. A grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view was obtained in 3.6 and 0.6% of cases respectively, with 3.3% considered a difficult intubation. There were four failed intubations (0.4%, 95% CI 0.01-0.9%), of which three were subsequently managed using a laryngeal mask airway. Antacid prophylaxis was used in 94% of elective cases and 64% of emergencies. Regurgitation of gastric contents was noted in eight cases (0.7%, 95% CI 0.2-1.2%), with one confirmed case of aspiration (0.1%, 95% CI 0.002-0.5%). There were no cases of serious airway-related morbidity. Conclusions: General anaesthesia is most commonly used in emergency situations. Tracheal intubation after rapid-sequence induction remains the predominant approach to airway management in Australasia. The incidence of failed intubation is consistent with previous studies. Aspiration prophylaxis is not routinely used for emergency surgery.",0,0
7941947,The haemodynamic response to the insertion of the laryngeal mask airway: a comparison with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation,The haemodynamic response to the insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was assessed and compared to that of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in a study of forty patients (ASA 1) randomly allocated into two groups and anaesthetised using a standard balanced anaesthetic technique. The results show that the changes in all cardiovascular parameters measured following LMA insertion were significantly less (P < 0.05) when compared with those following laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. We conclude that airway management with the LMA may be used to avoid the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation where such a response is undesirable.,0,0
21526669,Cardiovascular responses to orotracheal intubation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Comparing fiberoptic bronchoscopy with direct laryngoscopy,"Background: The intubation by using fiberoptic brochoscop (FOB) can avoid the mechanical stimulus to oropharyngolaryngeal structures thereby it is likely to attenuate hemodynamic response during orotracheal intubation. Based on this hypothesis, we compared the hemodynamic responses to orotracheal intubation using an FOB and direct laryngoscope (DLS) in patients undergoing general anesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Methods: Fifty patients with ASA physical status II and Mallampati score I and II were scheduled for elective CABG surgery under general anesthesia requiring orotracheal intubation were randomly allocated to either DLS group (n = 25) or FOB group (n = 25). The same protocol of anesthetic medications was used. Invasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP & DBP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before and after anesthesia induction, during intubation and in the first and second minutes after intubation. The differences among the hemodynamic variables recorded over time and differences in the circulatory variables between the two study groups were compared. Results: Duration of intubation was shorter in DLS group (19.3 +/- 4.7 sec) compared with FOB group (34.9 +/- 9.8 sec; p = 0.0001). In both study groups basic SBP and DBP and HR were not significantly different (P > 0.05). During the observation, there were no significant differences between the two groups in BP or HR at any time points or in their maximal values (all p values > 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that the FOB had no advantage in attenuating the hemodynamic responses to orotracheal intubation in patients undergoing CABG surgery.",0,0

23841295,[Comparison of the effects of dexmedetomidine and midazolam with fentanyl in patients with anticipated difficult intubation during awake blind nasal intubation],"Objective: To compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and midazolam with fentanyl with anticipated difficult intubation during awake blind nasal intubation on respiration and hemodynamics of patients. Methods: Forty patients (ASA class I to II) undergoing selective oral and maxillofacial surgeries with anticipated difficult intubation were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups. Experimental group received dexmedetomidine, control group received midazolam and fentanyl. The Ramsay sedation scores, mean artery pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and blood oxygen saturation of pulse (SpO2) were recorded at baseline (TI), beginning to intubate (T2), 10 min after beginning to intubate (T3), 20 min after beginning to intubate (T4), and after intubation (T5). The operative time for intubation, intubation times, success rate of intubation, the anesthetic effects and complications were recorded. Results: The success rate in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). Intubation times in the experimental group was less than that in the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of complications such as nausea, vomiting, cough and throat unwell in the control group was higher. Compared with the T1, RR decreased at T2 in the control group, but RR increased significantly at T4 and T5. RR and SpO2 had no significant change in the experimental group. Compared with T1, MAP and HR increased at T3, T4 and T5 in the control group (P<0.05). MAP and HR showed no significant variations in the experimental group (P>0.05). The Ramsay sedation scores in the control group were lower than those in the experimental group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Appropriate application of dexmedetomidine can be safer and more effective than midazolam with fentanyl for awake blind intubation.",0,0
19685138,Effect of posture on mouth opening and modified Mallampati classification for airway assessment,"Several bedside airway assessment methods have been proposed for preoperatively identifying patients who are difficult to intubate. To date, the Mallampati grading remains a time-tested technique for difficult airway assessment. Both Mallampati and the further modification by Samsoon and Young assessed patients in the seated position. During clinical practice, situations may arise where it may not be feasible for the patient to sit up for airway assessment. The aim of our prospective study was to determine whether there was any difference between the sitting and supine positions for the assessment of Mallampati grade. Eighty adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, aged 18-65 years, admitted to our neurosurgical ward were enrolled and assessed for airway. Our study revealed that change in posture produced a significant change in the mouth openings and Mallampati grades of the patients. This change was always toward a higher grade when the patient was turned supine from the sitting position.",0,0
18840592,Trachlight management of succinylcholine-induced subluxation of the Temporo-mandibular joint: a case report and review of the literature,"Purpose: We present a case of spontaneous subluxation of the Temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) induced by succinylcholine, to compare our experience with previous cases reported in the literature, and to review the pathophysiology, preoperative screening, and intraoperative management of TMJ instability. Clinical features: A 39-yr-old female with primary hyperparathyroidism and a normal airway examination presented for elective parathyroidectomy. Following induction of anesthesia and the administration of succinylcholine prior to jaw manipulation, her mouth could not be opened, and we suspected spontaneous subluxation of the TMJ. We secured the airway with the use of a Trachlight and, subsequently, reduced the joint. Postoperatively, a history of mild TMJ-related symptoms was elicited. Conclusion: Instability of the TMJ is not uncommon, and has several implications for airway management, highlighting the importance of preoperative screening. Limited mouth opening, due to spontaneous subluxation of the TMJ following succinylcholine-induced muscle relaxation in the absence of airway manipulation, has only twice been reported in the literature. This report highlights how tracheal intubation may be accomplished using the Trachlight, in order to secure the airway prior to reduction of the subluxed joint.",0,0
23453929,[Difficult airway management: assessment of knowledge and experience in anaesthesiology residents],"Objectives: Assessment of knowledge and experience in anaesthesiology residents on alternative techniques for difficult airway management. Method: Descriptive study using an anonymous electronic questionnaire, with 20 multiple-choice questions of 59 4th- and 5th-year residents in anaesthesiology of Amiens, Rouen and Caen University Hospitals (France). Results: Fourty-three (73%) answered to the questionnaire. Thirteen residents (30%) admitted to know last expert conference of the French Anaesthesiology Society partially, 19 (44%) didn't train on mannequin or simulator. Twelve residents (28%) admitted to be insufficient trained to set up a Fastrach in an emergency context, and 39 (91%) to set up a transtracheal oxygenation technique. The rates of residents reaching the educational objectives on patients were 4% for the Fastrach, 21% for fiberoptic intubation, 12% for cricothyroidotomy. Conclusion: Four years after the expert conference of the French Anaesthesiology Society, the educational objectives are not achieved during the resident training, both on mannequins or patients.",0,0
12403220,Airway complications in neonates who received mechanical ventilation,"Objective: To determine the incidence, type and severity of airway complications in high risk neonates who received conventional mechanical ventilation. Method: Forty-five infants who had received conventional mechanical ventilation in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital for at least 4 days were enrolled. Orotracheal intubation with blue line, non-cuffed, non-shouldered polyvinylchloride tube was used exclusively. The average number of intubations was 2 (range 1-7), and the average duration for intubation was 25 days. The details of the intubation, and the presence of respiratory distress after extubation were recorded. All of the infants had endoscopic examination of the airway within 5 days of extubation. Results: Following extubation, 14 (31.1%) infants developed signs of upper airway obstruction, of which inspiratory dyspnea was the most common manifestation. Only 4 infants developed inspiratory stridor, three of them had a birth weight greater than 2,500 g. Abnormal bronchoscopic findings were found in 42 infants, 68.8 per cent had multiple sites of injury. Supraglottic lesions were found in 55.7 per cent of cases. Laryngomalacia was an associated finding in 8 and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in 1 occasion. Conclusions: From the result of this study, the authors found that airway complications related to endotracheal intubation are common among survivors from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. When the diagnosis of airway complications only depends on symptoms and signs of upper airway obstruction, the incidence and extent of injuries may be under-estimated. When attempted extubation fails or when VLBW infants develop increasing respiratory distress that is not clearly explained by an apparent disorder involving the pulmonary parenchyma, flexible bronchoscopic examination should be performed at the bedside with minimal risk.",0,0
17296669,Airway management in critical illness,"Airway management in the ICU can be complicated due to many factors including the limited physiologic reserve of the patient. As a consequence, the likelihood of difficult mask ventilation and intubation increases. The incidence of failed airways and of cardiac arrest related to airway instrumentation in the ICU is much higher than that of elective intubations performed in the operating room. A thorough working knowledge of the devices available for the management of the difficult airway and recommended rescue strategies is paramount in avoiding bad patient outcomes. In this review, we will provide a conceptual framework for airway assessment, with an emphasis on assessment of the patient with limited cervical spine movement or injury and of morbidly obese patients. Furthermore, we will review the devices that are available for airway management in the ICU, and discuss controversies surrounding interventions like cricoid pressure and the use of muscle relaxants in the critically ill patient. Finally, strategies for the safe extubation of patients with known difficult airways will be provided.",0,0

In his childhood, tracheostomy had been performed for the repair of cleft lip and palate. His Mallampati classification was IV and preoperative endoscopic examination revealed megaloglossia and severe airway narrowing. For possible difficult airway, intubating laryngeal airway (air-Q®, size 2.5) was used for tracheal intubation. Following insertion of air-Q®, trachea was intubated via air-Q® guided with fiberscope.

8224126,Assessment of airway inflammation in asthmatic patients by visual endoscopic scoring systems,"Inflammation is a hallmark of bronchial asthma. Inflammatory cells both in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsies of asthmatic patients have been studied and correlated with functional or clinical parameters. We have recently attempted to assess airway inflammation by a visual endoscopic scoring system. The purpose of this study was to compare our own endoscopic scoring system with the bronchitis index previously described by Thompson and coworkers, and to determine whether these scores were correlated with clinical or functional parameters. Sixty asthmatics of variable severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 33-117% of predicted values) and 30 healthy volunteers were studied. The clinical severity of asthma was assessed by the clinical score as described by Aas in all of the patients, and in the last 15 patients by a daily symptom score. Beta 2-agonist consumption was recorded daily during a period of 7 days before the endoscopic procedure. During this period, circadian variation and day-to-day variation of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were determined. During bronchoscopy, airway inflammation was assessed by two independent observers, prior to BAL, by visual inspection of each lobe and the lingula, and the results were quantitated using the bronchitis index and our endoscopic scoring system. Both endoscopic scores were significantly higher in asthmatics than in controls. A significant correlation was observed between the two endoscopic scores both in asthmatics and in controls. In asthmatics, a weak but significant correlation was found between both endoscopic scores and the daily symptom score, as well as the beta 2-agonist consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
8355867,[The Mallampati's scale: a study of reliability in clinical practice],"The need to predict the rank of difficulty of tracheal intubation is of paramount importance in anaesthesia as has been well documented in numerous studies. We assessed the use of the Mallampati scale as possible predictive indicator of difficult tracheal intubation in a study conducted on 700 patients. The rank of difficulty determined during the pre-anaesthesiological examination by the Mallampati scale, was compared to the Cormack scale as assessed by the laryngeal direct examination at the beginning of anaesthesia. The correlation between the two first ranks of both scales was highly significant. The evaluation by the scale of Mallampati showed a good sensibility and a low specificity with incorrect overestimation only for the difficult intubation. In our study orotracheal intubation was rated difficult in 10.4% of the patients by the Mallampati scale and in 11% of the patients score by the Cormack scale. The chin to jugulum distance, also studied as a possible predictive parameter, did not correlate with the Cormack scale.",0,0
21451403,Difficult intubation in pregnancy,"Purpose of review: This review focuses on difficult intubation in pregnant patients, particularly during the late pregnancy when physiological, patho-physiological and psychological factors may cause or aggravate difficulties with providing sufficient oxygenation and securing the airway. It is intended to highlight the methodological approach to the difficult airway in this particular patient population and to draw relevant principles in dealing with this problem. Recent findings: There are strong indications for improvement in the outcome of airway management in pregnant patients; however, this is obscured by the growing frequency of caesarean sections and connected to this by more tracheal intubations. Various new airway devices have been suggested as alternative techniques for laryngoscopic intubation if the latter becomes difficult or failed. Summary: A scenario-oriented approach to the problem of difficult intubation in pregnant patients leads to the recognition of the unpredicted difficult or failed intubation as the main concern. The appropriate means to cope with this rare but life-threatening complication lies in a gradual employment of principles beginning with preferential application of regional anaesthesia techniques, followed by proceeding according to locally adapted simple and comprehensive failed intubation algorithms, design of a suitable difficult airway cart that contains only a few but well chosen items and by implementation of a continuous and mandatory training program to which all personnel are subjected to participate in regular intervals.",0,0
17922507,Analysis of dideoxyadenosine triphosphate by CE with fluorescence detection. I. Derivatization through the phosphate group,"A CZE method was developed, which separates 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate (ddATP) from other metabolites and endogenous nucleotides at high concentrations (20-200 microg/mL) to allow UV detection. To enhance sensitivity, fluorescence detection which requires prior derivatization of compounds was examined. Precapillary derivatization of ddATP in the presence of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) with dansyl ethylenediamine (dansyl EDA) was faster and stable compared to that of 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl ethylenediamine (BODIPY FL EDA). Reaction conditions, reagent concentrations and detection parameters were optimized and highest derivatization efficiency was achieved in 0.1 M 1-methylimidazole buffer (pH 8.0) with 140 mM EDAC in 1-methylimidazole buffer and 30 mM dansyl EDA in DMF for 90 min at 60 degrees C. Dansyl EDA derivatives of ddATP, 2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate (dATP) and ATP were comigrating with the CZE method; therefore, a MEKC method was developed and optimized for repeatable separations. Upon dansylation, sensitivity of ddATP with fluorescence detection (LOQ = 12 ng/mL) was 160 times higher than UV detection (LOQ = 1.9 microg/mL).",0,0
22111359,[Airway management in a patient with Williams syndrome],"Williams syndrome is characterized by the triad of supravalvular aortic stenosis (SAS), mental retardation and elfin facies. Generally, difficult airway is expected in patients with Williams syndrome by characteristic face. A 26-year-old female with Williams syndrome was scheduled for abdominal myomectomy under general anesthesia. Difficult mask ventilation and tracheal intubation were anticipated because of micrognathia, mandibular retrusion, and a Mallanpati class III airway. Before induction of anesthesia the patient breathed 100% oxygen for 3 minutes. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium bromide. Mask ventilation was easily performed. The direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack grade I and there was no difficulty in the tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, anesthetic course was uneventful. According to the most previous clinical reports in patients with Williams syndrome in Japan, mask ventilation and tracheal intubation were performed easily contrary to preoperative airway assessment. In view of SAS, mental retardation, airway deformity and airway assessment in previous clinical reports, we should select the optimal strategy for airway management in patients with Williams syndrome.",0,0
8073209,[Difficult intubation in obstetrics],"The obstetrical population is prone to difficult or failed intubation. Control of the airway is complicated by several factors specific to obstetric anesthesia: time of apnea is short due to a reduced functional residual capacity and pregnancy-induced hypertension and obesity are relatively frequent; anesthetist's skill can also be mentioned. The best approach to this problem lies in its prevention, using epidural analgesia as soon as possible. Furthermore, the number of difficult intubations can be considerably reduced by a thorough pre-anesthetic examination. Each anesthetist must keep an algorithm in mind, should a difficult or failed intubation in obstetrical patient occur. Whichever method is used (ventilation through a facial mask or laryngeal mask, transtracheal oxygenation), the anesthetist must never forget that the first priority is always the safety of the mother.",0,0
10947753,Comparison of a new video-optical intubation stylet versus the conventional malleable stylet in simulated difficult tracheal intubation,"Handling and efficacy of a new video-optical intubation stylet were assessed in a simulated difficult tracheal intubation setting and compared with a conventional malleable stylet. Forty-five anaesthetists performed 10 tracheal intubations using both techniques. Laryngoscopy was performed by the observer, who created a grade 3 view according the classification by Cormack and Lehane. The time taken to place the tracheal tube and the final tracheal tube positions were documented. Mean (SD) intubation time for the video-optical stylet was 20.4 (7.7) s and for the malleable stylet 10.2 (3.3) s (p<0.01). With the video-optical stylet the trachea was correctly intubated in all 225 attempts; with the malleable stylet 44 (19.6%) oesophageal and 44 (19.6%) endobronchial intubations occurred (p<0.01). The video-optical intubation stylet enabled us to recognise inappropriate tracheal tube positions and to correct them immediately.

23595225,A longitudinal cohort study to investigate the retention of knowledge and skills following attendance on the Newborn Life support course,"Aim: To investigate whether airway management and non-invasive ventilatory skills are retained after the Neonatal Life support (NLS) course. Methods: Candidates who attended and passed the NLS course were retested by two registered instructors using the NLS 'airway testing sheet' unannounced at 3-5 and 12-14 months after their NLS course. Prior to the test, they were also asked to complete a proforma, indicating their own assessment of their competence in being able to effectively carry out all the items used in the NLS airway test. Results: Sixty-seven candidates were tested at 3-5 months, 26 (39%) passed first time, 34 (51%) on retest and 7 (10%) failed. At 12-14 months, 43 were tested, 19 (44%) passed on first attempt, 22 (51%) on retest and 2 (5%) failed. At 12-14 months, more candidates exposed to more than five resuscitations per month passed first time compared to those who were exposed to less than one resuscitation per month (p=0.029). More candidates who were offered resuscitation training at 6 monthly intervals compared to at yearly intervals passed the test on their first attempt at 3-5 months (p=0.022). Self-assessment of competence was not different between candidates who passed and those who failed. Conclusions: This study suggests that skills when tested in a simulated scenario are highly likely to have deteriorated within a few months of attending the NLS course. There is a need for research to determine whether deteriorations in skills after the NLS, as assessed by simulation, correlate with deterioration of skills in clinical practice.",0,0
23882104,Assessment of central airway obstruction using impulse oscillometry before and after interventional bronchoscopy,"Background: Spirometry is used to physiologically assess patients with central airway obstruction (CAO) before and after interventional bronchoscopy, but is not always feasible in these patients, does not localize the anatomic site of obstruction, and may not correlate with the patient's functional impairment. Impulse oscillometry may overcome these limitations. We assessed the correlations between impulse oscillometry measurements, symptoms, and type of airway narrowing, before and after interventional bronchoscopy, and whether impulse oscillometry parameters can discriminate between fixed and dynamic CAO. Methods: Twenty consecutive patients with CAO underwent spirometry, impulse oscillometry, computed tomography, dyspnea assessment, and bronchoscopy, before and after interventional bronchoscopy. The collapsibility index (the percent difference in airway lumen diameter during expiration versus during inspiration) was calculated using morphometric bronchoscopic images during quiet breathing. Variable CAO was defined as a collapsibility index of > 50%. Fixed CAO was defined as a collapsibility index of < 50%. The degree of obstruction was analyzed with computed tomography measurements. Results: After interventional bronchoscopy, all impulse oscillometry measurements significantly improved, especially resistance at 5 Hz, which decreased from 0.67 ± 0.29kPa/L/s to 0.38 ± 0.17kPa/L/s (P < .001), and reactance at 20 Hz, which increased from -0.09 ± 0.11 to 0.03 ± 0.08 (P < .001). Changes in dyspnea score correlated with resistance at 5 Hz, the difference between the resistance at 5 Hz and the resistance at 20 Hz, and the reactance at 5 Hz, but not with spirometry measurements. The type of obstruction also correlated with dyspnea score, and showed distinct impulse oscillometry measurements. Conclusions: Impulse oscillometry measurements correlate with symptom improvements after interventional bronchoscopy. Impulse oscillometry might be useful to discriminate variable from fixed central airway obstruction.

Alignment of the ILMA with the larynx was assessed fibreoptically before intubation without the investigator performing the intubation being aware of the view score. Ease of intubation correlated with the view obtained and with the degree of manipulation of the ILMA needed to achieve tracheal intubation. Intubation was successful in 93 patients. Of the seven intubation failures, five occurred in the first 20 patients. Conventional connection to the breathing system and ventilation of the lungs of the patients were possible throughout the intubation procedure.",0,0
12827579,Difficult laryngoscopy: incidence and predictors in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery versus general surgery patients,"Objective: Cardiac surgery patients might have a higher incidence of difficult laryngoscopy than the general population because of older age, dental problems, and obesity. The authors estimated the incidence and predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in coronary artery bypass surgery patients. Design: Prospective, controlled study. Setting: University setting. Participants: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass or general surgery. Interventions: Two hundred consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft and 444 general surgery patients, all aged >40 years, were compared for the incidence and predictors of difficult laryngoscopy, defined as a grade III or IV view. Measurements and main results: Predictors of difficult laryngoscopy were considered mouth opening <4 cm, limited cervical mobility, thyromental distance <6 cm, protruding or partially missing upper teeth, and Mallampati classes 3 and 4. More cases of difficult laryngoscopy were recorded in cardiac patients (10% v 5.2%, p <0.023). The cardiac patients were older, mostly men, and belonged to ASA III-IV risk classes. Mallampati classes 3 and 4 were more frequent in the control group. With univariate analysis, difficult laryngoscopy correlated with 7 variables: older age, ASA-IV risk class, protruding or partially missing upper teeth, limited mouth opening, limited neck movement, thyromental distance <6 cm, and diabetes mellitus. Multivariate analysis adjusted for propensity score identified older age (odds ratio = 1.05/yr, 95% confidence interval = 1.005-1.09, p < 0.03) and limited neck movement (odds ratio = 9.5, 95% confidence interval = 2.2-41, p < 0.003), but not cardiac surgery per se, as independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. Conclusions: Difficult laryngoscopy was more frequent in cardiac surgery patients (10% v 5.2%). Older age and limited neck movement, but not cardiac surgery per se, were independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy.",1,1
15171524,Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in a population of Nigerian obstetric patients,"Difficulty in the maintenance of the airway during obstetric anaesthesia is a major contributory factor in anaesthetic related morbidity and mortality. There is an eightfold increase in the incidence of failed intubation in obstetrics. This is attributable to the physiological changes in pregnancy. Eighty consecutive obstetric patients, over a one year period who required general anaesthesia for caesarian section were evaluated using five bedside tests viz: Mallampati test, Thyrometal distance, Sterno-mental distance, Horizontal length of the Mandible and Inter-incisor gap. Eight patients had difficult laryngoscopy (10%). Mallampati test had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 87.1%, 99.6% and 70% respectively. The values obtained for the Thyro-mental distance were 62.5%, 93.1% and 50% respectively. The other tests were not able to predict intubation difficulty significantly. When all tests were combined, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive were values 100%, 36.1% and 14.8%. The combination of Mallampati and Thyro-mental distance had values of 100%, 93.1% and 61.5%--sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Mallampati can be used as the sole predictor of difficult intubation in Nigerian obstetric patients.",1,1
15517112,[An unexpected difficult intubation. Bonfils rigid fiberscope],"A solution to managing intubation difficulties during anaesthesia induction is described in this article. After two attempts at laryngoscopy had failed, endotracheal intubation was achieved by the combined use of a laryngoscope and the Bonfils rigid fiberscope. The successful technique involved two anaesthesiologists, one who displaced the patient's tongue to the left ventral part of the mouth with a laryngoscope and cleared the airway by suctioning, and one who accomplished the intubation using the Bonfils rigid fiberscope by following the blade of the laryngoscope to the larynx. After securing a good view of the vocal cords, the tube was successfully inserted into the trachea. The entire procedure of intubation was accomplished within 20 s.",0,0
1863125,Site of upper airway obstruction in preterm infants with problematical apnoea,Airway obstruction is an important factor predisposing to the development of apnoea in preterm infants. An ultrafine fibreoptic scope was used to examine the upper airway of 12 preterm infants with recurrent problematical apnoea. Continuous visualisation of the airway was possible and recorded on to videotape together with simultaneous cardiorespiratory monitoring to detect apnoeic episodes in 12 infants studied. In seven infants obstruction was observed at laryngeal level with the arytenoid masses and aryepiglottic folds closing across the vocal cords. This was not only observed in obstructive apnoea but also during mixed apnoea in periods where no respiratory effort was detectable and again in apparently pure central apnoea. The findings confirm the larynx as an anatomical site of upper airway obstruction. They agree with other indirect methods of assessing airway patency that obstruction has an important role in the pathophysiology of apnoea of prematurity.,0,0

We discuss anesthetic considerations and the pathology of temporomandibular joint anterior disk dislocation without reduction. A simple maneuver to reduce the dislocation is described.",0,0
10081546,One-lung ventilation when intubation is difficult--presentation of a new endobronchial blocker,"Background: One-lung ventilation utilizing a double-lumen endotracheal tube may be technically difficult or inappropriate in morbidly obese or critically ill patients. In patients requiring awake fiberoptic intubation, double-lumen tube placement may be impossible. Wire-guided endobronchial blockade through a conventional endotracheal tube is a new alternative for these patients. Methods: A 44-year-old, 133 kg female patient was scheduled to undergo a thoracotomy for transthoracic fundoplication. A wire-guided endobronchial blocker (WEB) was placed following rapid-sequence induction and intubation with an 8.0 OD single-lumen endotracheal tube with the aid of a pediatric bronchoscope. Results: The WEB, using a guiding loop, was placed with ease and allowed effective one-lung ventilation. Conclusion: The WEB system allows one-lung ventilation to be achieved with a conventional endotracheal tube. The need for reintubation at the end of surgery is eliminated and endotracheal tube cross-sectional area is conserved.",0,0
26048574,Difficult intubation and outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a registry-based analysis,"Background: Airway management during resuscitation attempts is pivotal for treating hypoxia, and endotracheal intubation is the standard procedure. This German Resuscitation Registry analysis investigates the influence of airway management on primary outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, in a physician-based emergency system. Methods: A total of 8512 patients recorded in the German Resuscitation Registry (2007-2011) were analyzed. The Return of Spontaneous Circulation After Cardiac Arrest (RACA) score was used to compare observed return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rates with the ROSC predicted by the score and to analyze factors influencing the primary outcome. Patients were classified into three groups: difficult intubation, impossible intubation, and a control group with normal airways. Results: The observed ROSC matched the predicted ROSC in the group with difficult airways. The impossible intubation group had lower ROSC rates (31.3% vs. 40.5%; P < 0.05). Impossible intubation was more frequent in men (OR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.43-3.63; P = 0.001), young patients (OR 2.18; 95% CI, 1.26-3.76; P = 0.005) and those with trauma (OR 2.22; 95% CI, 1.01-4.85; P = 0.046). Fewer impossible intubations were reported when the emergency physicians were anesthesiologists (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.96; P = 0.028). If a supraglottic airway device was not used in the impossible intubation group, the observed ROSC (18.0%; 95% CI, 7.4-28.6%) was poorer than predicted (38.2%) (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Outcomes after resuscitation attempts are poorer when endotracheal intubation is not possible. Predictive factors for impossible intubation are male gender, younger age, and trauma. Supraglottic airway devices should be used at an early stage whenever these negative factors are present.",0,0
24668055,Laryngeal mask airways and use of a Boyle-Davis gag in ENT surgery: is there a learning curve? A prospective analysis,"Objectives: The objective was to identify whether the experience of the operating surgeon was relevant to the frequency of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) airway obstruction or change to an endotracheal tube during ear, nose, and throat surgery. Methods: Data were prospectively collected for 186 patients undergoing a procedure with the use of a Boyle-Davis gag and LMA over 12 months in a district-general hospital in the United Kingdom. patient demographics (age, mallampati grade), grade of surgeon, grade of anesthetist, LMA size inserted, and any intraoperative adjustments needed were recorded. Results: There was an overall intraoperative airway intervention rate of 21%. The experience of the surgeon affected the rate of intraoperative airway interventions encountered, reflected by the significantly lower rate of airway complications (ie, 10%) seen when associate specialists perform these types of procedures compared to other grades of surgeon (Fisher's exact test 2-tailed P value = .04). A significant complication rate of 50% was seen with core surgical trainees compared to other grades of surgeon (Fisher's exact test 2-tailed P value = .002). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest there may be a learning curve for otolaryngology trainees when using a LMA. However, larger studies and further subanalyses are essential before further conclusions can be made.",0,0

10632910,The laryngeal mask airway in the difficult paediatric airway: an assessment of positioning and use in fibreoptic intubation,"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was used in 34 children who presented with difficult airways and difficulty in intubation. All 34 children were a grade 3 or grade 4 Cormack and Leehane view at conventional laryngoscopy. The laryngeal mask airway was used as part of the anaesthetic technique. It was either used as the method of airway maintenance during a short procedure or as an aid to fibreoptic intubation. The results of its use in this group of patients showed that overall a good airway was obtained in 73% of patients and an adequate airway in 27%, and in no patient was a poor airway obtained. The fibreoptic positioning of the LMA, taken from the distal aperture of the laryngeal mask airway showed that, overall, in 29.5% of patients a full view of the glottis (grade 1) was obtained, in 29.5% of patients a partial view of the glottis (grade 2) was obtained and in 41% a view of the epiglottis only (grade 3) was obtained. In no patient was a view excluding the epiglottis obtained. In children with a mucopolysaccharide disorder, the number of children who had a grade 3 view increased to 54%. Children with a disorder other than mucopolysaccharidosis had a grade 3 view in only 17% of cases. Children with mucopolysaccharidoses had a grade 1 view in only 14% of cases compared with 58% in the group with other disorders. Of the 34 patients, 21 patients were intubated on 31 separate occasions. There were no failures. The complications of the fibreoptic intubation technique described are outlined.",0,0
26449550,Drug-induced sedation endoscopy versus clinical exploration for the diagnosis of severe upper airway obstruction in OSAHS patients,"Background: Identifying the sites of obstruction of the upper airway in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is paramount for surgical planning. The aim of this study is to compare wake physical exam findings to the ones obtained during drug-induced sedation endoscopy (DISE) in the diagnosis of severe collapse of the upper airway in OSAHS patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review of OSAHS patients who underwent DISE at our institution during the 2006-2010 period was conducted. All the patients had previously undergone a physical examination that included modified Mallampati index (MMI), the Müller maneuver (MM), and the Friedman staging system. Level and severity of airway collapse were evaluated. A severe collapse was attributed to obstructions equal or greater than 75 % of the airway. Results: A total of 138 patients were included in the study. The incidence of severe airway collapse was compared between DISE and MM; at retropalatal level, no significant difference was found. At retrolingual level, 69 % of patients had severe collapse with DISE in comparison to a 28 % with the MM (p < 0.05). No relationship was found either with the MMI or with the Friedman staging system when compared to the incidence of severe retrolingual collapse diagnosed by DISE. Concordance was low between awake and DISE exploration in both retropalatal and retroglossal level. Conclusion: The Müller maneuver underestimates tongue base severe obstruction diagnosis when compared to that obtained after DISE in OSAHS patients. The wake patient exploration does not accurately correlate to DISE exploration.",0,0

15662057,Can an airway assessment score predict difficulty at intubation in the emergency department?,"Aim: To assess whether an airway assessment score based on the LEMON method is able to predict difficulty at intubation in the emergency department. Methods: Patients requiring endotracheal intubation in the resuscitation room of a UK teaching hospital between June 2002 and September 2003 were assessed on criteria based on the LEMON method. At laryngoscopy, the Cormack and Lehane grade was recorded. An airway assessment score was devised and assessed. Results: 156 patients were intubated during the study period. There were 114 Cormack and Lehane grade 1 intubations, 29 grade 2 intubations, 11 grade 3 intubations, and 2 grade 4 intubations. Patients with large incisors (p<0.001), a reduced inter-incisor distance (p<0.05), or a reduced thyroid to floor of mouth distance (p<0.05) were all more likely to have a poor laryngoscopic view (grade 2, 3, or 4). Patients with a high airway assessment score were more likely to have a poor laryngoscopic view compared with those patients with a low airway assessment score (p<0.05). Conclusions: An airway assessment score based on criteria of the LEMON method is able to successfully stratify the risk of intubation difficulty in the emergency department. Patients with a poor laryngoscopic view (grades 2, 3, or 4) were more likely to have large incisors, a reduced inter-incisor distance, and a reduced thyroid to floor of mouth distance. They were also more likely to have a higher airway assessment score than those patients with a good laryngoscopic view.",0,1
23087456,Randomized crossover comparison of the laryngeal mask airway classic with i-gel laryngeal mask airway in the management of difficult airway in post burn neck contracture patients,"Purpose: The objective of the study was to compare the performance of i-gel supraglottic airway with cLMA in difficult airway management in post burn neck contracture patients and assess the feasibility of i-gel use for emergency airway management in difficult airway situation with reduced neck movement and limited mouth opening. Methods: Prospective, crossover, randomized controlled trial was performed amongst forty eight post burn neck contracture patients with limited mouth opening and neck movement. i-gel and cLMA were placed in random order in each patient. Primary outcome was overall success rate. Other measurements were time to successful ventilation, airway leak pressure, fiberoptic glottic view, visualization of square wave pattern. Results: Success rate for the i-gel was 91.7% versus 79.2% for the cLMA. i-gel required shorter insertion time (19.3 seconds vs. 23.5 seconds, P=0.000). Airway leak pressure difference was statistically significant (i-gel 21.2 cm H20; cLMA 16.9 cm H(2)0; P=0.00). Fiberoptic view through the i-gel showed there were less epiglottic downfolding and better fiberoptic view of the glottis than cLMA. Overall agreement in insertion outcome for i-gel was 22/24 (91.7%) successes and 2/24(8.3%) failure and for cLMA, 19/24 (79.16%) successes and 5/24 (16.7%) failure in the first attempt. Conclusion: The i-gel is cheap, effective airway device which is easier to insert and has better clinical performance in the difficult airway management of the airway in the post burn contracture of the neck. Our study shows that i-gel is feasible for emergency airway management in difficult airway situation with reduced neck movement and limited mouth opening in post burn neck.",0,0
26628451,Successful intubation of a difficult airway due to a large obstructive vocal cord polyp augmented by the delivery of a transtracheal injection of local anaesthetic,"We describe a case of a very difficult intubation which was safely navigated through careful planning. Our patient presented initially with increasing hoarseness and shortness of breath over a 6-month period. This was investigated and the patient was found to have a large vocal cord mass and was referred for urgent microlaryngoscopy and vocal cord polypectomy. On the day of surgery the obstruction was noted and awake fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used with a remifentanil infusion. Given the mass was large and increased in size with expiration, the time frame to pass the tube was extremely short. We delivered a transtracheal injection of local anaesthesia. This approach allowed for safe passage of the endotracheal tube. In patients such as this it may be worth considering the use of a transtracheal injection in the first instance.",0,0
15195057,Management of Ludwig's angina with small neck incisions: 18 years experience,"Objective: To review Ludwig's angina medical and surgical approach with small incisions. Study design: Retrospective, open, noncomparative, longitudinal. Methods: All patients with Ludwig's angina who received medical, metabolic, airway management, and surgical treatment from January 1, 1983 to December 31, 2000. Studied parameters: Antibiotic treatment, surgical treatment, hospitalization time, associated diseases, etiologic factors, recuperation time. Results: Age range was 18 to 87 years, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.1:1 (68 females, 53 males). Thirty patients belonged to middle or high socioeconomic status. The primary site of infection was odontogenic in 107 of the patients. All the patients were managed with surgical drainage made within the first 12 hours after hospital admission. The most common antibiotic treatments were the combination of clindamycin with crystalline penicillin G. The hospital stay for more than half of patients was 6 days or less. In 62 patients we found extension into the parapharyngeal space and in 32 cases we found retropharyngeal extension of the Ludwig's angina. Forty-six patients had or were diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. Tracheotomy was required in 34 patients. The airway of the rest of patients was controlled with nasotracheal intubation. Only 33 patients had major complications, such as mediastinitis, sepsis, or death. Conclusions: Drainage using small incisions is a safe and effective method as part of treatment of Ludwig's angina.",0,0

Swelling can begin rapidly, and typically involves the tongue and oral cavity. We have recently encountered four cases in which supraglottic edema developed after onset of tongue swelling and progressed despite resolving tongue edema. We present a representative case. This observation suggests that all patients with ACEI-induced angioedema should undergo laryngeal fiberoptic examination and appropriate airway management.",0,0
6482626,Endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy for the treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis,"Most patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis have a fairly satisfactory voice, but their airway is usually compromised. The management of such patients presents a challenge to the otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon. Numerous surgical procedures have been developed in an attempt to improve the patients's airway insufficiency without leaving him with a breathy, weak voice. Arytenoidectomy is currently the most reliable method of treating patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Although both endoscopic and external approaches have been described for performing an arytenoidectomy, the endoscopic technique is more desirable since it requires no incision and theoretically allows for the immediate assessment of airway size. The addition of the CO2 laser to the surgical armamentarium offers certain refinements to the technique of endoscopic arytenoidectomy. Eleven patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis of the larynx have been treated by endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy by the authors utilizing a technique developed by the two senior authors and subsequently taught to over 200 participants of the CO2 laser workshops sponsored by the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Northwestern University Medical School; 10 of the 11 patients have been successfully decannulated. The technique and problems of this operation will be discussed.",0,0
10631442,[One-lung respiration in a nasally intubated patient using a single-lumen endobronchial tube],"We report the case of a 57-year-old patient who underwent a right-sided thoracotomy. The preoperative examination of the patient already revealed a clear diminution of the mouth opening (Mallampati class 4). Ventilation per mask following the induction of anaesthesia was unproblematic. As oral intubation with a double-lumen tube seemed to be impossible because of the difficult anatomic conditions, nasal intubation was carried out. For this we used a left-sided single-lumen endobronchial tube of Rüsch (size 8.0). The tube was inserted into the left mainstem bronchus using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Intraoperatively we were able to ventilate exclusively the dependent left lung by inflating the bronchial cuff. The operation itself was performed on the collapsed right lung. At the end of the operation the right lung could be ventilated once again by deflating the bronchial cuff (tracheal cuff inflated). This example demonstrates that one-lung ventilation is possible even under difficult intubation conditions.",0,0
18595253,[Clinical observation of Cookgas intubating laryngeal airway in anticipating difficult tracheal intubation],"Objective: To compare the clinical effects of Cookgas intubating laryngeal airway (CILA) in facilitating fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) and Shikani optical stylet (SOS)-guided intubations in anticipating difficult tracheal intubation. Methods: Totally 60 anticipated difficult tracheal intubation patients undergoing selective plastic surgery under general anesthesia were allocated to FOB group (n = 30) and SOS group (n = 30). After anesthesia induction and CILA insertion, the patients were treated with FOB or SOS-guided intubation via CILA. The time of intubation and CILA removal and the time and the success rate of CILA insertion were recorded. Noninvasive blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before and after anesthesia induction at CILA insertion, at intubation, at CILA removal, and every minute thereafter for 5 minutes. Results: CILA was inserted successfully in all patients. The first intubation attempt succeeded in all but two who succeeded in the second and the third attempt respectively in FOB group. In SOS group, 18 patients were successfully intubated in the first attempt, and 7 patients were successfully intubated in the second attempt; SOS failed in 5 patients with severe cervical scars, and then FOB was successfully used to intubate. The time of the intubation [(60.2 +/- 29.6) vs. (92.4 +/- 47.9)s] and CILA removal [(104.6 +/- 39.9) vs. (130.0 +/- 51.9) s] in SOS group were significantly longer than in FOB group (P < 0.05). Hemodynamic changes during the intubation with CILA in these two groups were minimal. Conclusions: FOB and SOS-guided tracheal intubation via CILA is safe and effective in anticipating the outcome of difficult airway management. Compare to SOS-guided intubation, the time of FOB-guided intubation is shorter and the success rate is higher.",0,0
10708198,"Medical students can learn the basic application, analytic, evaluative, and psychomotor skills of critical care medicine","Objective: To determine whether fourth-year medical students can learn the basic analytic, evaluative, and psychomotor skills needed to initially manage a critically ill patient. Design: Student learning was evaluated using a performance examination, the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Students were randomly assigned to one of two clinical scenarios before the elective. After the elective, students completed the other scenario, using a crossover design. Setting: Five surgical intensive care units in a tertiary care university teaching hospital. Participants: Forty fourth-year medical students enrolled in the critical care medicine (CCM) elective. Interventions: All students evaluated a live ""simulated critically ill"" patient, requested physiologic data from a nurse, ordered laboratory tests, received data in real time, and intervened as they deemed appropriate. Measurements and main results: Student performance of specific behavioral objectives was evaluated at five stations. They were expected to a) assess airway, breathing, and circulation in appropriate sequence; b) prepare a manikin for intubation, obtain an acceptable airway on the manikin, demonstrate bag-mouth ventilation, and perform acceptable laryngoscopy and intubation; c) provide appropriate mechanical ventilator settings; d) manage hypotension; and e) request and interpret pulmonary artery data and initiate appropriate therapy. OSCEs were videotaped and reviewed by two faculty members masked to time of examination. A checklist of key behaviors was used to evaluate performance. The primary outcome measure was the difference in examination score before and after the rotation. Secondary outcomes included the difference in scores at each rotation. The mean preelective score was 57.0%+/-8.3% compared with 85.9%+/-7.4% (p<.0001) after the elective. Significant improvement was demonstrated at each station except station I. Conclusion: Fourth-year medical students without a CCM elective do not possess the basic cognitive and psychomotor skills necessary to initially manage critically ill patients. After an appropriate 1-month CCM elective, students' thinking and application skills required to initially manage critically ill patients improved markedly, as demonstrated by an OSCE using a live simulated ""patient"" and manikin.",0,0
25296191,Children's safety initiative: a national assessment of pediatric educational needs among emergency medical services providers,"Objective: Emergency medical services (EMS) providers may have critical knowledge gaps in pediatric care due to lack of exposure and training. There is currently little evidence to guide educators to the knowledge gaps that most need to be addressed to improve patient safety. The objective of this study was to identify educational needs of EMS providers related to pediatric care in various domains in order to inform development of curricula. Methods: The Children's Safety Initiative-EMS performed a three-phase Delphi survey on patient safety in pediatric emergencies among providers and content experts in pediatric emergency care, including physicians, nurses, and prehospital providers of all levels. Each round included questions related to educational needs of providers or the effect of training on patient safety events. We identified knowledge gaps in the following domains: case exposure, competency and knowledge, assessment and decision making, and critical thinking and proficiency. Individual knowledge gaps were ranked by portion of respondents who ranked them ""highly likely"" (Likert-type score 7-10 out of 10) to contribute to safety events. Results: There were 737 respondents who were included in analysis of the first phase of the survey. Paramedics were 50.8% of respondents, EMT-basics/first responders were 22%, and physicians 11.4%. The top educational priorities identified in the final round of the survey include pediatric airway management, responder anxiety when working with children, and general pediatric skills among providers. The top three needs in decision-making include knowing when to alter plans mid-course, knowing when to perform an advanced airway, and assessing pain in children. The top 3 technical or procedural skills needs were pediatric advanced airway, neonatal resuscitation, and intravenous/intraosseous access. For neonates, specific educational needs identified included knowing appropriate vital signs and preventing hypothermia. Conclusions: This is the first large-scale Delphi survey related to pediatric prehospital education. Our results provide foundational information related to the educational needs of prehospital providers. Medical directors and educators can use the results to shape future curricular development.",0,0
27276767,PREDICTORS OF DIFFICULT AIRWAY MANAGEMENT IN THYROID SURGERY: A FIVE-YEAR OBSERVATIONAL SINGLE-CENTER PROSPECTIVE STUDY,"Difficult tracheal intubation (DI) is more common in thyroid than in other surgical branches due to thyromegaly. Proper preoperative airway evaluation is necessary in order to reduce the potential numerous complications. The study examined the incidence of DI in thyroid surgery and the influence of tracheal dislocation and other risk factors on DI. A prospective study was conducted on 2379 patients who underwent thyroidectomy at the Center for Endocrine Surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia, from 2007 to 2012. Patients were divided into groups with (n = 162) and without DI (n = 2217). Besides tracheal dislocation, another 13 risk factors contained in 13 screening tests and three additional factors of gender, age and diagnosis were defined. The incidence of DI in our study was 6.81%. The presence of tracheal dislocation was statistically significant, but not an independent predictor of DI. The diagnosis, large circumference and small neck length, previous DI, recessive mandible, tooth characteristics and oral anomalies were the most significant and independent predictors of DI. Neck circumference and small neck length had highest sensitivity. Previous DI had highest specificity. Thyromegaly, if causing tracheal dislocation and/or stenosis, represents a significant DI predictor, not individually, but in combination with other factors.",0,0

Associated difficult airway is mainly due to micrognathia, retrognathia, webbing of neck and limitation of the mouth opening and neck extension. We report a case of a 1 year old child with Escobar syndrome posted for bilateral hamstrings to quadriceps transfer. The child had adequate mouth opening with no evidence of cervical spine fusion, yet we faced difficulty in intubation which was ultimately overcome by securing a proseal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) and then by intubating with an endotracheal tube railroaded over a paediatric fibreoptic bronchoscope passed through the lumen of a PLMA.",0,0
15673888,Retrograde submental intubation by pharyngeal loop technique in a patient with faciomaxillary trauma and restricted mouth opening,"Submental intubation is useful for airway management during maxillofacial surgery when both nasal and orotracheal intubation are deemed unsuitable and to avoid a tracheostomy, especially when long-term ventilatory support is not required in the postoperative period. Adequate mouth opening is a prerequisite for all the techniques described for submental intubation, as the initial step is orotracheal intubation. Hence, this procedure has never been reported in a patient with the inability to open the mouth. We describe the technique of retrograde submental intubation with the help of a pharyngeal loop assembly for the first time in a patient with maxillofacial trauma and restricted mouth opening in whom oral and nasal intubations were not possible and tracheostomy was the only alternative.

One of these measures, thyromental distance (TMD), has often been called into question. However, there have been no published studies evaluating whether anesthesia practitioners are measuring TMD accurately, especially if they use fingerbreadths as opposed to a centimeter ruler. A convenience sample of 60 anesthesia providers were asked to participate in a brief study. The subjects were asked a series of questions, including the type of anesthesia provider they were, how often they used TMD, and their estimates in centimeters of the following fingerbreadth combinations: index finger, index and second finger, index plus second and third fingers, and index plus second, third, and fourth fingers. After their estimates were recorded, exact measurements of the fingerbreadth combinations were made at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. The differences between the means of the estimated and the actual measurements were analyzed using an independent t test. There was a statistically significant difference between estimated and actual fingerbreadth measurement for the index finger (P < .006) but not for the combinations of fingers.",0,0
7576678,Hemodynamic comparison of direct vision versus blind oral endotracheal intubation,"Study objective: To determine the hemodynamic response to airway manipulation and endotracheal intubation by comparing the direct oral method of the Macintosh laryngoscope to the blind oral method of the Augustine guide. Design: Prospective, comparative, randomized study. Setting: University medical center. Patients: 24 ASA physical status I and II, nonpregnant female patients aged 18 years or older, undergoing outpatient gynecologic surgery with general anesthesia. Interventions: Patients were preoxygenated and received alfentanil 10 mcg/kg five minutes prior to anesthesia induction with thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg. Under random assignment, patients (n = 12 in each group) were intubated with the Macintosh laryngoscope or the Augustine guide. After intubation, 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen and 1.5% inspired concentration of isoflurane were administered. Measurements and main results: Oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured at baseline and at minutes 1 to 6 postinduction (time zero). Intubation time was defined as the interval between removal of the face mask from the patient's face and reconnection of the circle system airway connector after successful endotracheal intubation. The number of attempts and time to successful endotracheal intubation were noted. There was no difference between groups in age, weight, height, Mallampati airway class, oxygen saturation (at least 98%), or MAP. There was a significant difference (p < 0.01) between groups (percent change from baseline) in HR from minutes 1 to 4 postinduction. Time to successful endotracheal intubation was significantly longer (p < 0.05, mean +/- SEM) with the Augustine guide (91.0 +/- 15.9 seconds) than with the Macintosh laryngoscope (24.0 +/- 1.73 seconds). Conclusions: The Augustine guide, a new technique for orally intubating patients blindly and when head and neck manipulations are contraindicated, had less of an effect on HR compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope. Minimal lifting of the tongue and mandible required with the Augustine guide could account for the decreased HR response. The Augustine guide appears to be a promising new addition to the airway armamentarium and deserves further testing.",0,0
18592965,[Obstructive sleep apnea and anesthesia],"Even though the effects of surgery and anesthesia on sleep have not been completely defined yet, it is an irrefutable fact that the patients with sleep apnea could experience significant perioperative complications, in terms of common difficult airway problems, as well as prolonged emergence from anesthesia. Besides, there are strong evidences of correlation between sleep apnea and hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Preoperative questions about sleep, possible snoring, or excessive daytime sleepiness should become a routine part of preanesthesia evaluation, together with airway examination and thorough pulmonary and cardiovacular examination. However, the exact severity of the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could be precisely defined only by polysomnography. Every patient diagnosed with OSA, or with clinical suspicion of OSA, should be considered to have a difficult airway, until proven otherwise, and consequently has increased risk of anesthesia. The possible problems may arise during tracheal intubation, extubation, or with postoperative analgesia, since opioids increase the incidence of pharyngeal collapse. Whenever possible, regional anesthesia techniques should be used. On the other hand, by documenting every difficult airway management, difficult intubation or prolonged recovery, the anesthesiologists are in good position to effectively screen for OSA in population.",0,0
2747398,Comparative analysis of the safety of endotracheal tubes with the KTP laser,"The KTP laser has been used increasingly to treat various disorders of the upper aerodigestive tract. To establish the relative safety of the endotracheal tubes that are currently available, we performed laboratory testing of these tubes by exposing them to the KTP laser in an oxygen-rich environment. Based on our observations, tubes that were all metal or metal-wrapped endotracheal tubes were determined to be the safest. The advantage of using the all-metal tube was that it did not need wrapping. This tube also has a second distal cuff, which would allow for continued ventilation if the proximal cuff becomes disrupted. However, under these circumstances, insertion of a new nondisrupted tube is advised.",0,0
19447014,Endobronchial ultrasound,"The efficacy and technical aspects of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) are reviewed because this technology promises to revolutionise bronchoscopy. EBUS extends the endoscopist's view beyond the mucosal surface of the large airways to peri-bronchial structures and peripheral lung lesions. Guided biopsies and real-time transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) have been shown to increase the diagnostic yield over conventional bronchoscopic techniques. The technology is available in two forms: radial EBUS probes and linear EBUS-TBNA bronchoscopes. Radial EBUS utilizes higher frequencies and the transducer is inserted via a standard flexible bronchoscope. The higher ultrasound frequencies improve image resolution to <1mm. Radial EBUS is used to assess airway walls, guide TBNA (diagnostic yield: 72-86%) and diagnose peripheral lung lesions (diagnostic yield: 61-80%). Linear EBUS-TBNA transducers are built into dedicated bronchoscopes to produce sector view images and permit real-time TBNA. The pooled sensitivity of real-time EBUS-TBNA in lung cancer is 90% but the false negative rate is 20%. Therefore, EBUS-TBNA is a viable alternative to cervical mediastinoscopy in the diagnosis and staging of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, negative results need either further confirmatory testing or adequate clinical follow-up. Complications are rare with either EBUS modality and are usually related to the underlying biopsy procedure rather than the use of ultrasound. Procedure duration is short enough to be incorporated into an outpatient setting and can performed under moderate sedation. Clear training standards are emerging to facilitate credentialing as EBUS is rapidly evolving to become a part of standard diagnostic bronchoscopy.",0,0
12462780,[Regional anesthesia of the airways in difficult tracheal intubation in a conscious patient with spontaneous respiration],"Clinical pattern of anesthesia, hemodynamic and gas exchange states were evaluated in 64 patients with congenital or acquired damage of maxillary-facial region due to tumor or trauma. 51 patients were intubated under locoregional anesthesia of the upper respiratory tract (superior laryngeal nerves, glossopharyngeal nerves, intratracheal anesthesia) by means of blind nasal or oral fiberoptic retrograde and by using laryngeal mask technique. In 12 cases fiberoptic device was used for intubation under local anesthesia by lidocaine solution. There was no airways obstruction in any case. Satisfactory anesthesia in oropharynx, larynx and trachea was reached in all cases, the most profound blockage of airways and lack of pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes being in patients under locoregional anesthesia. So locoregional anesthesia can be used for awake intubation.",0,0
23595703,Sleepiness and sleep-disordered breathing in truck drivers : risk analysis of road accidents,"Background: Portugal has one of the highest road traffic fatality rates in Europe. A clear association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and traffic accidents has been previously demonstrated. This study aimed to determine prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and other sleep disorder symptoms among truck drivers and to identify which individual traits and work habits are associated to increased sleepiness and accident risk. Methods: We evaluated a sample of 714 truck drivers using a questionnaire (244 face-to-face interviews, 470 self-administered) that included sociodemographic data, personal habits, previous accidents, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Berlin questionnaire (BQ). Results: Twenty percent of drivers had EDS and 29 % were at high risk for having obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Two hundred sixty-one drivers (36.6 %) reported near-miss accidents (42.5 % sleep related) and 264 (37.0 %), a driving accident (16.3 % sleep related). ESS score ≥ 11 was a risk factor for both near-miss accidents (odds ratio (OR)=3.84, p<0.01) and accidents (OR=2.25, p<0.01). Antidepressant use was related to accidents (OR=3.30, p=0.03). We found an association between high Mallampati score (III-IV) and near misses (OR=1.89, p=0.04). Conclusion: In this sample of Portuguese truck drivers, we observed a high prevalence of EDS and other sleep disorder symptoms. Accident risk was related to sleepiness and antidepressant use. Identifying drivers at risk for OSAS should be a major priority of medical assessment centers, as a public safety policy.",0,0
23302983,Review article: Extubation of the difficult airway and extubation failure,"Respiratory complications after tracheal extubation are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, suggesting that process improvements in this clinical area are needed. The decreased rate of respiratory adverse events occurring during tracheal intubation since the implementation of guidelines for difficult airway management supports the value of education and guidelines in advancing clinical practice. Accurate use of terms in defining concepts and describing distinct clinical conditions is paramount to facilitating understanding and fostering education in the treatment of tracheal extubation-related complications. As an example, understanding the distinction between extubation failure and weaning failure allows one to appreciate the need for pre-extubation tests that focus on assessing airway patency in addition to evaluating the ability to breathe spontaneously. Tracheal reintubation after planned extubation is a relatively rare event in the postoperative period of elective surgeries, with reported rates of reintubation in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit between 0.1% and 0.45%, but is a fairly common event in critically ill patients (0.4%-25%). Conditions such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, major head/neck and upper airway surgery, and obstetric and cervical spine procedures carry significantly increased risks of extubation failure and are frequently associated with difficult airway management. Extubation failure follows loss of upper airway patency. Edema, soft tissue collapse, and laryngospasm are among the most frequent mechanisms of upper airway obstruction. Planning for tracheal extubation is a critical component of a successful airway management strategy, particularly when dealing with situations at increased risk for extubation failure and in patients with difficult airways. Adequate planning requires identification of patients who have or may develop a difficult airway, recognition of situations at increased risk of postextubation airway compromise, and understanding the causes and underlying mechanisms of extubation failure. An effective strategy to minimize postextubation airway complications should include preemptive optimization of patients' conditions, careful timing of extubation, the presence of experienced personnel trained in advanced airway management, and the availability of the necessary equipment and appropriate postextubation monitoring.",0,0
8440104,Comparison of mask and nasal continuous positive airway pressure after extubation and mechanical ventilation,"Objective: To examine the effects of continuous positive airway pressure applied via face masks and nose masks on the change in functional residual capacity and gas exchange. Design: Descriptive and prospective study. Setting: Intensive care unit of a university hospital. Patients: Ten patients with acute lung injury who had required mechanical ventilation. Interventions: Continuous positive airway pressure at a level of 10 cm H2O applied in random order via face and nose masks. Measurements and main results: Both continuous positive airway pressure methods resulted in an almost identical increase of functional residual capacity. During nasal continuous positive airway pressure, the increase in functional residual capacity was 294 +/- 82 mL. During mask continuous positive airway pressure, the increase in functional residual capacity was 290 +/- 85 mL. PaO2 increased and the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension/alveolar oxygen tension quotient decreased significantly during mask continuous positive airway pressure and nasal continuous positive airway pressure at a level of 10 cm H2O. Two patients showed a periodic change in their breathing patterns; they took a few breaths at an increased lung volume, followed by one deep expiration caused by mouth opening. Change in mask pressure was negligible in these two patients. Using a visual analog scale (10 = highly comfortable; 0 = severely uncomfortable), the patients rated nasal continuous positive airway pressure (8.6 +/- 0.9) significantly more comfortable than mask continuous positive airway pressure (2.6 +/- 0.8). Conclusion: The major advantages of continuous positive airway pressure (the improvement of functional residual capacity and oxygen transfer) can also be achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure in the postextubation period in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for acute lung injury.",0,0
22677878,Randomized controlled trial comparing the McGrath videolaryngoscope with the C-MAC videolaryngoscope in intubating adult patients with potential difficult airways,"Background: Difficult and failed intubations, although rarely encountered, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the current anaesthetic practice. To reduce the incidence of difficult and failed intubations, several devices including the recently developed videolaryngoscopes are available. This randomized controlled study aims to compare the use of the McGrath videolaryngoscope with the C-MAC videolaryngoscope in adult patients with potential difficult airways. Methods: A total of 130 patients with the Mallampati grade of ≥3, requiring orotracheal intubation, were randomized to either having intubation with the McGrath videolaryngoscope or the C-MAC videolaryngoscope. The primary outcome was time to intubation. The laryngoscopic view, the number of intubation attempts, the proportion of intubation success, the ease of intubation, the haemodynamic responses to intubation, and the incidence of any complications were also recorded. Results: Time to successful intubation with the C-MAC videolaryngoscope was shorter when compared with the McGrath videolaryngoscope {50 s [inter-quartile range (IQR) 38-70] vs 67 s (IQR 49-108), P<0.001}, despite the McGrath videolaryngoscope providing significantly more grade 1 laryngoscopic views. The C-MAC videolaryngoscope also resulted in significantly fewer intubation attempts and greater ease of intubation when compared with the McGrath videolaryngoscope. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of intubation success, the number of complications, and the changes in haemodynamic responses between the two videolaryngoscopes. Conclusions: The C-MAC videolaryngoscope allowed a quicker intubation time, fewer intubation attempts, and greater ease of intubation compared with the McGrath videolaryngoscope when used in patients with the Mallampati grade of ≥3.",0,0
23330419,Difficult airway management with bonfils fiberscope in case of emergency: acute abdomen with ileus,"This clinical report describes an emergency case of a 49-year-old man, ASA E III status, with clinical symptoms of acute abdomen and ileus, who was scheduled for urgent surgery. Predictors of difficult intubation (Mallampati test Class III, short thyro-mental (< 6 cm) and sterno-mental distance (<10 cm) with limited mouth opening (inter-incisor gap < 3 cm) were associated with significant comorbidity (rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, obesity (body mass index 32.6 kg m-2), cervical spine mobility and generalized vascular disease). A specialist experienced in airway management decided on one attempt of Bonfils fiberoptic intubation as primary intervention and urgent tracheotomy, if needed, as secondary intervention. Immediately after assuming supine position on the operating table, the patient lost consciousness and cardiac arrest developed. Successful intubation with oxygenation was followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Upon stabilization of the patient's vital functions, urgent surgery was performed. In the emergency case presented, we succeeded quickly to secure the airway with Bonfils fiberoptic intubation, which allowed for appropriate oxygenation and starting resuscitation. The high risk of the possible aspiration was avoided by timely provision of airway in the experienced anesthetist's hands.",0,0
25942697,Solvent-free synthesis and application of nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO4] composite for dual separation and immobilization of stable and radioactive cesium in contaminated soils,"This study assessed the synthesis and application of nano-Fe/Ca/CaO-based composite material for use as a separation and immobilizing treatment of dry soil contaminated by stable ((133)Cs) and radioactive cesium species ((134)Cs and (137)Cs). After grinding with nano-Fe/CaO, nano-Fe/Ca/CaO, and nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO4], approximately 31, 25, and 22 wt% of magnetic fraction soil was separated. Their resultant (133)Cs immobilization values were about 78, 81, and 100%, respectively. When real radioactive cesium contaminated soil obtained from Fukushima was treated with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO4], approximately 27.3 wt% of magnetic and 72.75% of non-magnetic soil fractions were separated. The highest amount of entrapped (134)Cs and (137)Cs was found in the lowest weight of the magnetically separated soil fraction (i.e., 80% in 27.3% of treated soil). Results show that (134)Cs and (137)Cs either in the magnetic or non-magnetic soil fractions was 100% immobilized. The morphology and mineral phases of the nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO4] treated soil were characterized using SEM-EDS, EPMA, and XRD analysis. The EPMA and XRD patterns indicate that the main fraction of enclosed/bound materials on treated soil included Ca/PO4 associated crystalline complexes. These results suggest that simple grinding treatment with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO4] under dry conditions might be an extremely efficient separation and immobilization method for radioactive cesium contaminated soil.",0,0
22137510,Standard clinical risk factors for difficult laryngoscopy are not independent predictors of intubation success with the GlideScope,"Study objectives: To determine whether the first-attempt tracheal intubation incidence using the GlideScope videolaryngoscope is higher in patients with predicted increased risk of difficult laryngoscopy, and to assess the ability of other a priori defined standard risk factors to predict first-attempt intubation success, in aggregate and by forming scores. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Operating room in a tertiary-care academic center. Patients: 357 patients intubated with the GlideScope for nonemergent general anesthesia. Interventions and measurements: Mallampati airway class was used to create two groups of patients, one with higher and the other, lower, potential difficult laryngoscopy (Mallampati classes 3-4 and 1-2, respectively). Intubation success on the first attempt with the GlideScope videolaryngoscope in patients with a Mallampati class 3 or 4 airway versus those with Mallampati class 1 or 2 airway was tested. We also evaluated the predictive ability of the Mallampati airway class (1 and 2 vs 3 and 4) along with 9 other possible predictors of difficult intubation on first-attempt intubation success: gender, age, body mass index, level of training within our anesthesia residency program (Clinical Anesthesia Resident years 1, 2, and 3), ASA physical status, mouth opening, thyromental distance, neck flexion, and neck extension. Main results: None of the standard predictors of difficult intubation was significantly associated with outcome after adjusting for other predictors. A multivariable model containing the aggregate set of variables predicted outcome significantly better than a risk score formed as the sum of 10 predictors (""Risk 10""; P = 0.0176). Conclusions: With GlideScope-assisted tracheal intubation, Mallampati airway class is not an independent risk factor for difficult intubation. Other standard clinical risk factors of difficulty with direct laryngoscopy also do not appear to be individually predictive of first-attempt success of tracheal intubation.",0,0
8738685,Preoperative evaluation of intubation conditions in patients scheduled for elective surgery,"Prediction of a difficult airway is a continuing problem. Several tests have been developed in order to overcome this problem. It has been proposed that using more than one test could increase the degree of predictability. One hundred patients scheduled for general surgery were successfully evaluated using three methods: 1. The size of the tongue in relation to the oral cavity (Mallampati gradation). 2. The thyromental and the mandibular length. 3. The atlanto-occipital angle. Seven patients had a difficult laryngoscopy and were difficult to intubate. It was possible to predict differenties in all seven patients, but it was found that only the Mallampati gradation and the atlanto-occipital angle contributed significantly to predictability. The cost of predicting further difficulties in all patients with a difficult laryngoscopy was a false positive prediction in a further 13 patients who had no problems with laryngoscopy or intubation. By increasing the specificity of the tests the number of false positive classifications could be reduced to 10 patients, but this would have led to the missing of one patient with a difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0

In all cases, airway patency was well preserved with the device and there were no significant problems with its use. The notion of a 'dedicated airway' for difficult intubation cases is developed. A trouble-free airway will permit time to consider solutions for difficult cases and time for the novice to learn fibreoptic laryngoscopy technique.",0,0

26559371,Development of a new system for guidewire-assisted tracheal intubation: manikin and cadaver evaluation,"Guided intubation using a tracheal tube and semi-rigid introducer is associated with technical difficulties, failure and traumatic complications. We describe the development of a new system of guidewire-assisted tracheal intubation that may circumvent these problems. A reinforced silicone tracheal tube was modified with a guide channel built inside its wall, and a nitinol non-kinking guidewire was matched to this channel. Both anterograde and retrograde tracheal intubation were evaluated in a test rig, an airway manikin and then in preserved and fresh cadavers. There was minimal resistance to passage of the guidewire through the guide channel when the modified tube was in an anatomical configuration, in contrast to moderate resistance when an Airway Exchange Catheter was passed through a PVC tracheal tube. Intubation using the new equipment required increased force in the manikin and preserved cadavers, but minimal force in fresh cadavers. Resistance to tracheal tube advancement in preserved cadavers was overcome by withdrawal followed by 90° rotation, but this manoeuvre was not required in fresh cadavers. We suggest that the combination of the modified tracheal tube and matching guidewire may allow easy and reliable single-step guided tracheal intubation when used in patients.",0,0
26721826,An alternative method to achieve one-lung ventilation by surgical pneumothorax in difficult lung isolation patient: a case report,"It is challenging to establish one-lung ventilation in difficult airway patients. Surgical pneumothorax under spontaneous breathing to obtain well-collapsed lung is a feasible method for thoracic surgery. A 76-year-old man with right empyema was scheduled for decortication. The patient had limited mouth opening due to facial cellulitis extending from the left cheek to neck. Generally, lung isolation is achieved by double-lumen endotracheal tube or bronchial blocker. Double-lumen tube insertion is difficult for patients with limited mouth opening and right-side placement of bronchial blocker usually causes insufficient deflation. We introduce an alternative lung isolation technique by surgical pneumothorax under spontaneous breathing simply with an endotracheal tube placement. This technique has never been applied into the management of difficult one-lung ventilation. By this method, we provide an ideal surgical condition with safer, less time-consuming, and less skill-demanding anesthesia. It would be an alternative choice for management of one-lung ventilation in the difficult lung isolation patient.",0,0

The 13 tips discussed in this review fall into 4 categories. System factors that facilitate training, patient safety, and avoidance of crises including the use of appropriate personnel, importance of timing, use of premedication, and the utility and content of a preprocedure briefing. Suggestions to prevent loss of the airway include tips on airway assessment, preparation of airway equipment, and use of exchange catheter techniques. Strategies to avoid and manage both microvascular and large-vessel bleeding are discussed. We also discuss the management of common postprocedure problems including tracheostomy tube obstruction, malposition requiring tube exchange or replacement, and air leak. The practical considerations for successful execution of PDT involve common sense, thorough planning, and structured approaches to prevent adverse effects if the procedure does not go as smoothly as expected. These strategies will aid anesthesiologists and intensivists in improving their comfort level, safety, and competence in performing this beside procedure.",0,0
26004598,Predictive value of bedside tests for difficult intubations,"Objective: The aim of this study is to find the ideal test(s) for the prediction of difficult laryngoscopic intubation. Patients and methods: One hundred and twenty patients were selected at random for this prospective observational study. The patients' preoperative exams include the assessment of Mallampati classification, thyromental, sternomental, interincisor distances and neck circumference. The laryngoscopy was evaluated with using the Cormack Lehane classification. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of tests, alone and in combination, were assessed. Results: No statistically significant difference was found between the difficult and easy intubation cases. Sternomental distance showed the highest sensitivity (76%) and positive predictor value (54%). As the critical value of neck circumference was set to 35 cm and above, the sensitivity was 74% and positive predictive value, 53%. For the neck circumference and sternomental distance combination, which is determined to be the most reliable and accurate criteria, the sensitivity was 62% and positive predictive value, 42%. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the sternomental distance and neck circumference combination may be a more accurate predictor of difficult intubation.",1,1

20357144,Derivation and validation of a simple perioperative sleep apnea prediction score,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a largely underdiagnosed, common condition, which is important to diagnose preoperatively because it has implications for perioperative management. Our purpose in this study was to identify independent clinical predictors of a diagnosis of OSA in a general surgical population, develop a perioperative sleep apnea prediction (P-SAP) score based on these variables, and validate the P-SAP score against standard overnight polysomnography. Methods: A retrospective, observational study was designed to identify patients with a known diagnosis of OSA. Independent predictors of a diagnosis of OSA were derived by logistic regression, based on which prediction tool (P-SAP score) was developed. The P-SAP score was then validated in patients undergoing overnight polysomnography. Results: The P-SAP score was derived from 43,576 adult cases undergoing anesthesia. Of these, 3884 patients (7.17%) had a documented diagnosis of OSA. Three demographic variables: age > 43 years, male gender, and obesity; 3 history variables: history of snoring, diabetes mellitus Type 2, and hypertension; and 3 airway measures: thick neck, modified Mallampati class 3 or 4, and reduced thyromental distance were identified as independent predictors of a diagnosis of OSA. A diagnostic threshold P-SAP score > or = 2 showed excellent sensitivity (0.939) but poor specificity (0.323), whereas for a P-SAP score > or = 6, sensitivity was poor (0.239) with excellent specificity (0.911). Validation of this P-SAP score was performed in 512 patients with similar accuracy. Conclusion: The P-SAP score predicts diagnosis of OSA with dependable accuracy across mild to severe disease. The elements of the P-SAP score are derived from a typical university hospital surgical population.",0,0
12782807,Association of systematic head and neck physical examination with severity of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome,"Objectives/hypothesis: To identify upper airway and craniofacial abnormalities is the principal goal of clinical examination in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. The aim was to identify anatomical abnormalities that could be seen during a simple physical examination and determine their correlation with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Study design: Consecutive patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome who were evaluated in a public otorhinolaryngology center were studied. Methods: Adult patients evaluated previously with polysomnography met the inclusion criteria. All subjects underwent clinical history and otolaryngological examination and filled out a sleepiness scale. Physical examination included evaluation of pharyngeal soft tissue, facial skeletal development, and anterior rhinoscopy. Results: Two hundred twenty-three patients (142 men and 81 women) were included (mean age, 48 +/- 12 y; body mass index, 29 +/- 5 kg/m2; AHI, 23.8 +/- 24.8 events per hour). Patients were distributed into two groups according to the AHI: snorers (18.4%) and patients with sleep apnea (81.7%). Sleepiness and nasal obstruction were reported by approximately half of patients, but the most common complaint was snoring. There was a statistically significant correlation between AHI and body mass index (P <.000), modified Mallampati classification (P =.002), and ogivale-palate (P <.001). The retrognathia was not correlated to AHI, but the presence of this anatomical alteration was much more frequent in patients with severe apnea when compared with the snorers (P =.05). Other correlations with AHI were performed considering multiple factors divided into two groups of anatomical abnormalities: pharyngeal (three or more) and craniofacial (two or more) abnormalities. There was a statistically significant correlation between pharyngeal landmarks and AHI (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.147, P =.027), but not between craniofacial landmarks and AHI. The combination of pharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, modified Mallampati classification, and body mass index were also predictive of apnea severity. Conclusions: Systematic physical examination that was used in the present study indicated that, in combination, body mass index, modified Mallampati classification, and pharyngeal anatomical abnormalities are related to both presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Hypertrophied tonsils were observed in only a small portion of the patients. The frequency of symptoms of nasal obstruction was high in sleep apnea patients. Further studies are needed to find the best combination of anatomical and other clinical landmarks that are related to obstructive sleep apnea.",0,0

23225922,Incidence and predictors of difficult mask ventilation and intubation,"Background: This study is aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of difficult and impossible mask ventilation. Materials and methods: Information like age, snoring history, obstructive sleep apnea, dental and mandibular abnormalities, macroglossia, grading like SLUX, Mallampatti, Cormack Lehanne, atlantooccipital extension, presence of beard or moustache, mouth opening were collected. During mask ventilation, the information related to the ventilation and intubation was collected. All variables found to be significant in univariate analysis were subjected to the multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of measured outcome. Results: Difficult mask ventilation (DMV) was observed in 30 male patients and 9 female patients. Of the 40 patients who had difficult intubation (DI), 7 patients had both DMV and intubation and 1 patient was of impossible mask ventilation/ intubation. Snoring was the lone significant risk factor for DMV. The risk factors identified for DI were snoring, retrognathia, micrognathia, macroglossia, short thick neck, Mallampatti grade [III/IV], abnormal SLUX grade, Cormack Lehanne grade [II,III/IV], abnormal atlantooccipital extension grading, flexion/extension deformity of neck, protuberant teeth, cervical spine abnormality, mouth opening < 3 cm, and BMI > 26 kg/m(2). BMI > 26 kg/m(2) and atlantooccipital extension grade > 3 were independent risk factors for DI and the presence of two of the variables made the sensitivity and specificity of 43% and 99% respectively with a positive predictive value of 74%. Conclusions: The predictive score may lead to a better anticipation of difficult airway management, potentially deceasing the morbidity and mortality resulting from hypoxia or anoxia with failed ventilation.",0,0
16674625,"A randomised, crossover study of the Dorges, McCoy and Macintosh laryngoscope blades in a simulated difficult intubation scenario","The use of alternative adult laryngoscope blades in an unexpected difficult intubation was evaluated with a human patient simulator manikin. Twenty anaesthetists of varying experience attempted to intubate the trachea of a high fidelity simulator in both its normal and difficult intubation settings using Macintosh, Dorges and McCoy laryngoscopes in a randomised order. The time taken to intubate, Cormack and Lehane scores, percentage of glottic opening visible, failure rate, number of attempts and subjective ease of use were recorded. The Dorges and McCoy blades did not perform any better than the standard Macintosh blade in either the easy or difficult tracheal intubation settings. Guidelines recommending the use of an alternative blade in an unexpected difficult intubation scenario have limited supporting evidence. This study does not support this recommendation.",0,0
15286545,"A prospective, randomized, study comparing early percutaneous dilational tracheotomy to prolonged translaryngeal intubation (delayed tracheotomy) in critically ill medical patients","Objective: The timing of tracheotomy in patients requiring mechanical ventilation is unknown. The effects of early percutaneous dilational tracheotomy compared with delayed tracheotomy in critically ill medical patients needing prolonged mechanical ventilation were assessed. Design: Prospective, randomized study. Setting: Medical intensive care units. Patients: One hundred and twenty patients projected to need ventilation >14 days. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Patients were prospectively randomized to either early percutaneous tracheotomy within 48 hrs or delayed tracheotomy at days 14-16. Time in the intensive care unit and on mechanical ventilation and the cumulative frequency of pneumonia, mortality, and accidental extubation were documented. The airway was assessed for oral, labial, laryngeal, and tracheal damage. Early group showed significantly less mortality (31.7% vs. 61.7%), pneumonia (5% vs. 25%), and accidental extubations compared with the prolonged translaryngeal group (0 vs. 6). The early tracheotomy group spent less time in the intensive care unit (4.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 16.2 +/- 3.8 days) and on mechanical ventilation (7.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 17.4 +/- 5.3 days). There was also significantly more damage to mouth and larynx in the prolonged translaryngeal intubation group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the benefits of early tracheotomy outweigh the risks of prolonged translaryngeal intubation. It gives credence to the practice of subjecting this group of critically ill medical patients to early tracheotomy rather than delayed tracheotomy.",0,0
26082175,Endotracheal intubation in the ICU,"Endotracheal intubation in the ICU is a high-risk procedure, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Up to 40% of cases are associated with marked hypoxemia or hypotension. The ICU patient is physiologically very different from the usual patient who undergoes intubation in the operating room, and different intubation techniques should be considered. The common operating room practice of sedation and neuromuscular blockade to facilitate intubation may carry significant risk in the ICU patient with a marked oxygenation abnormality, particularly when performed by the non-expert. Preoxygenation is largely ineffective in these patients and oxygen desaturation occurs rapidly on induction of anesthesia, limiting the time available to secure the airway. The ICU environment is less favorable for complex airway management than the operating room, given the frequent lack of availability of additional equipment or additional expert staff. ICU intubations are frequently carried out by trainees, with a lesser degree of airway experience. Even in the presence of a non-concerning airway assessment, these patients are optimally managed as a difficult airway, utilizing an awake approach. Endotracheal intubation may be achieved by awake direct laryngoscopy in the sick ICU patient whose level of consciousness may be reduced by sepsis, hypercapnia or hypoxemia. As the patient's spontaneous respiratory efforts are not depressed by the administration of drugs, additional time is available to obtain equipment and expertise in the event of failure to secure the airway. ICU intubation complications should be tracked as part of the ICU quality improvement process.",0,0
27188115,[Anesthetic Management of an Adrenoleukodystrophy Patient for Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy],"A 34-year-old man with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) was scheduled for pump system insertion of intrathecal baclofen therapy under general anesthesia. ALD, a rare genetic disorder, is associated with a total body increase in long chain fatty acids caused by defective degradation, and includes various nervous system abnormalities, muscular weakness, in addition to adrenal insufficiency. He had contracture of the both legs, and muscular weakness of the left hand, and Mallampati class III, but no respiratory disability. In the operating room, we administered hydrocortisone 100 mg for steroid coverage, and low-dose midazolam, and fentanyl. As spontaneous breathing remained, we could easily see epiglottis and arytenoid cartilage by McGRATH. Therefore we selected rapid-induction of anesthesia with thiamylal, and rocuronium 40 mg, under cricoid pressure. We avoided propofol. Anesthsia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil, monitoring BIS and train of four. No more rocuronium was administered, and anesthesia was uneventful. Intrathecal baclofen therapy is given to patients who have severe contracture. When we selected general anesthesia, we should be aware of the possibility of muscular weakness, and cannot intubate cannot ventilate scenario.",0,0
14717875,The airway in patients with craniofacial abnormalities,"Airway management for patients with craniofacial disorders poses many challenges. The anaesthesiologist must be familiar with the normal bony and soft-tissue anatomy in the airway and how anatomy is altered by various congenital disorders. Specific areas to assess include the oral cavity, anterior mandibular space, maxilla, temporomandibular joint and vertebral column. Congenital conditions that may alter normal anatomy and therefore anaesthetic management include cleft lip and palate with or without Pierre Robin syndrome, craniofacial dysostosis, mandibulofacial dysostosis/Treacher Collins syndrome, hemifacial microsomia, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, trisomy 21/Down's syndrome, Freeman-Sheldon/whistling face syndrome/craniocarpotarsal dysplasia, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, mucopolysaccharidosis and vascular malformations.",0,0
16867084,Basic airway management by junior doctors: assessment and training on human apnoeic subjects in the anaesthetic room,"We assessed the airway management skills of 20 junior doctors on patients in the anaesthetic room, using a self-inflating bag with digital flowmeter to measure exhaled tidal volume. Following induction of anaesthesia the junior doctor attempted to ventilate the patient's lungs with five breaths. If two of these breaths were > 250 ml the assessment was completed. If not, a period of instruction was given followed by a further five-breath assessment. Eight doctors did not need further training; of these, six were senior house officers and seven had been on an Advanced Life Support course. Twelve doctors required instruction and re-assessment. Four were senior house officers and two had been on an Advanced Life Support course. They showed some improvement following the instruction period but never reached the standard of the other eight. Validated courses improve resuscitation skills but hands-on training in the anaesthetic room can also be of benefit in maintaining these skills.",0,0

Thus, there is increasing interest in monitoring airway inflammation in asthma, which may provide a longer term assessment of disease activity. Most methods of assessing asthmatic inflammation are invasive, and are not feasible in the paediatric population. This review discusses exhaled nitric oxide as a marker of asthmatic inflammation, and compares it with other recognized markers. Exhaled nitric oxide has the potential to become a noninvasive method of assessing asthma control in the paediatric population.",0,0
8325056,Increased frequency of obstructive airway abnormalities with long-term tracheostomy,"Eighty-one patients with long-term tracheostomy tubes (mean duration, 4.9 months) were examined via fiberoptic bronchoscopy prior to decannulation. Obstructive airway lesions were observed in 54 patients (67 percent). All tracheal lesions were anatomically located proximal to the stoma. No cuff lesions were observed. The two most commonly observed lesions were tracheal granuloma (60 percent) and tracheomalacia (29 percent). Less frequently observed lesions were tracheostenosis (14 percent) and vocal cord and laryngeal dysfunction (8 percent). As a result of the high frequency of tracheal abnormalities, especially that for tracheal granuloma which has not been previously reported (to our knowledge), we recommend that all decannulation candidates undergo anatomic examination of the airways.",0,0
15550183,The myth of tracheomalacia and difficult intubation in cases of retrosternal goitre,"Although it is widely believed that management of the airway is difficult in surgery for retrosternal goitre, a review of the literature, revealing management of 1969 patients with retrosternal goitre, provided scant evidence of difficult intubation or post-operative tracheomalacia resulting in tracheal collapse.

9583543,Airway compression in children due to congenital heart disease: value of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopic assessment,"Objective: To evaluate the frequency and severity of airway compression due to congenital heart disease in children and validate the use of the fiberoptic bronchoscope to assess them. Design: A retrospective study. Setting: A single-institutional study in a university hospital. Participants: Seventy-two children with congenital heart disease. Interventions: Airway endoscopy was performed in an awake child in cases of clinical and/or radiologic respiratory signs or in cases of preoperative assessment of a cardiac abnormality that is known to accompany airway compression. Measurements and main results: Endoscopy was well tolerated; 71% of the children had endoscopic abnormalities and 50% had airway compression. The locations of these compressions are the same as those described in the literature in the cases of vascular rings and left-to-right shunts. The other endoscopic findings were laryngeal and bronchial abnormalities, tracheobronchial malacia, respiratory signs of gastroesophageal reflux, and positive bacteriologic sputum samples. Conclusion: Endoscopy in an awake patient is the only way to evaluate the functional component of a compression due to malacia; the resulting collapse of the airway can cause trapping of air and secretions. Furthermore, fiberoptic bronchoscopy offers a complete examination of the airways and can help detect airway abnormalities that are potential causes of complications. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a suitable and well-tolerated examination that is easy to perform at the bedside of the child. This technique optimizes the preoperative assessment of children with congenital heart disease.",0,0

Here we evaluate if patients with CCJM and sleep respiratory disorders (SRD) present smaller airway dimensions than patients without SRD. Method: Patients with CCCM with and without sleep respiratory disturbances were evaluated clinically by Bindal's score, modified Mallampati classification, full-night polysomnography and upper airway cone beam tomography. Results: Eleven patients had sleep respiratory disorders (SRD), and nine patients performed control group without SRD. CCJM patients with SRD were predominantly female, older, had higher BMI, were more likely to have Mallampati grades 3 and 4 and had statistically significant smaller anteroposterior diameter of the upper airway than patients without SRD. Conclusion: Patients with CCJM and sleep respiratory disturbances have higher BMI, higher Mallampati score and smaller anterior posterior diameter of the upper airway.",0,0
14980953,The intubating laryngeal mask airway facilitates tracheal intubation in the lateral position,"Although the difficulty of tracheal intubation in the lateral position has not been systematically evaluated, airway loss during surgery in a laterally positioned patient may have hazardous consequences. We explored whether the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) facilitates tracheal intubation in patients with normal airway anatomy, i.e., Mallampati grade <or=3 and thyromental distance >or=5 cm, positioned in the lateral position. We evaluated whether this technique can be used as a rescue when the airway is lost during the middle of surgery in laterally positioned patients with respect to success rate and intubation time. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium in 50 patients undergoing spine surgery for lumbar disk herniation (Lateral) and 50 undergoing other surgical procedures (Supine). Patients having disk surgery (Lateral) were positioned on their right or left sides before induction of general anesthesia, and intubation was performed in that position. Patients in the control group (Supine) were anesthetized in supine position, and intubation was performed in that position. Intubation was performed blindly via an ILMA in both groups. The time required for intubation and number and types of adjusting maneuvers used were recorded. Data were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, chi(2) test, or unpaired Student's t-test, as appropriate. Data presented as mean (SD). Demographic and airway measures were similar in the two groups, except for mouth opening, which was slightly wider in patients in the lateral position: 5.1 (0.9) versus 4.6 (0.7) cm. The time required for intubation was similar in each group ( approximately 25 s), as was intubation success (96%). We conclude that blind intubation via an ILMA offers a frequent success rate and a clinically acceptable intubation time (<1 min) even in the lateral position. Implications: Blind intubation via the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) offers frequent success and a clinically acceptable intubation time even in patients in the lateral position.",0,0
21334510,Anesthesia in a patient with Job's syndrome (hyper IgE). Case report,"Background and objectives: Job's syndrome (JS), one of the presentations of the Hyper IgE Syndrome, is a rare immunodeficiency. It includes cutaneous abscesses, recurring pneumonias, pneumatoceles, eosinophilia, hyperimmunoglobulinemia E (> 2,000 IU.mL(-1)), and craniofacial and bone growth changes. This report describes the disease and its anesthetic management. Case report: The patient is a 13 year old black male, 40 kg, ASA II, with Job's Syndrome diagnosed 6 months prior to this admission. The patient was admitted for elongation of the right femur. He denied use of drugs and prior surgeries; he presented good cervical mobility, interincisive distance greater than 3 cm, Mallampati II, without signs of infection. Preoperative exams were within normal limits. He was monitored with electrocardioscope, SpO(2), non-invasive blood pressure, and P(ET)CO(2). After pre-oxygenation, general anesthesia was induced and he was maintained with sevoflurane. At the end of the procedure, the patient was extubated after reversal of the neuromuscular blockade, and the patient was transferred to the PACU with Aldrete 9, He was discharged from the hospital 72 hours later, without complications. Conclusions: The choice of anesthetic technique is guided by rigorous observation among risks and benefits for each patient, according to respiratory sequelae, risk of infection, and surgical site. In the patient described here, we considered that neuroaxis anesthesia could be associated with an increased risk of severe infections due to the patient immunologic background. The procedure was safely performed with general anesthesia.",0,0

26672974,Laryngo-tracheal ultrasonography to confirm correct endotracheal tube and laryngeal mask airway placement,"Waveform capnography was recommended as the most reliable method to confirm correct endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway placements. However, capnography may be unreliable during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and during low flow states. It may lead to an unnecessary removal of a well-placed endotracheal tube, re-intubation and interruption of chest compressions. Real-time upper airway (laryngo-tracheal) ultrasonography to confirm correct endotracheal tube placement was shown to be very useful in cadaveric models and during emergency intubation. Tracheal ultrasonography does not interrupt chest compressions and is not affected by low pulmonary flow or airway obstruction, but is limited by ultrasonography scattering and acoustic artifacts generated in air - mucosa interfaces. Sonographic upper airway assessment emerges as a rapid and easily available method to predict difficult intubation, to assess the laryngeal and hypopharyngeal size and visualize the position of the laryngeal mask airway in situ. This study demonstrates that the replacement of air with saline in endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway cuffs and the use of the contrast agents enables detection of cuffs in the airway. It also allows visualization of the surrounding structures or tissues as the ultrasound beam can be transmitted through the fluid - filled cuffs without being reflected from air - mucosal interfaces.",0,0
20721609,Possible difficult laryngoscopy caused by masticatory muscle tendon-aponeurosis hyperplasia: we anesthesiologists should be aware of this disease,Masticatory muscle tendon-aponeurosis hyperplasia (MMTAH) is a new disease entity characterized by limited mouth opening due to contracture of the masticatory muscles resulting from hyperplasia of tendons and aponeuroses. The other clinical feature is that the face of the patient with this disease displays a square mandible configuration. Muscle relaxants provide no relief for the limited mouth-opening ability. Anesthesiologists need to suspect difficult airway when patients have limited mouth opening with square mandible configuration. MMTAH can therefore be a possible cause of difficult intubation.,0,0
20347564,[Performance of the glottiscopes: a randomized comparative study on difficult intubation simulation manikin],"Introduction: We have prospectively compared simulated-difficult tracheal intubation characteristics of four glottiscopes: Airtraq, GlideScope, McGrath, LMA CTrach with that of the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope. Study design: prospective with the airway devices proposed in a randomly assigned order. Materials and method: Forty-two physicians, naïve to glottiscope handling accepted participating this study after the learning curve of each airway device was completed. Participants were requested to perform two series of five tracheal intubations on the manikin Airman, the first in standard situation and the second in difficult tracheal intubation simulation. The airway devices were chosen in a randomly assigned order. For each airway tool, the following tracheal intubation characteristics were recorded: laryngeal exposure quality, tracheal intubation and apnea durations. A performance index was calculated and a tracheal intubation difficulty was measured during simulation. Results: More than 1600 supervised tracheal intubations were performed, including 1000 for the learning process of the glottiscopes, which was completed after 10 uses on the manikin. During standard situation, laryngeal exposure quality was similar with the five airway devices. As compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope, GlideScope, McGrath, tracheal intubation duration was shorter (p<0.05) with the Airtraq and longer (p<0.01) with the LMA CTrach. During difficult tracheal intubation simulation, laryngeal exposure and tracheal intubation duration was of better quality and shorter with the four glottiscopes as compared to that of LM, respectively. Performance index during difficult tracheal intubation simulation simulation was significantly more important (p<0.01) with the Airtraq and the LMA CTrach. Airtraq and Macintosh laryngoscope were respectively the simplest (p<0.01) and the most difficult (p<0.01) airway devices to manage a simulated difficult tracheal intubation. Conclusion: When difficult airway was simulated on the manikin, the four glottiscopes were superior to the Macintosh laryngoscope to improve laryngeal exposure quality and to reduce duration of tracheal intubation. Airtraq and the LMA CTrach both demonstrated remarkable advantage over GlideScope and McGrath for simulated difficult intubation management.",0,0
25725929,Decompression of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes due to mycobacterium tuberculosis causing severe airway obstruction in children,"Background: Large airway compression by enlarged tuberculosis (TB) lymph nodes results in life-threatening airway obstruction in a small proportion of children. The indications, safety, and efficacy of TB lymph node decompression are inadequately described. This study aims to describe the indications and efficacy of TB lymph node decompression in children with severe airway compression and investigate variables influencing outcome. Methods: A prospective cohort of children (aged 3 months to 13 years) with life-threatening airway obstruction resulting from TB lymph node compression of the large airways were enrolled. The site and degree of airway obstruction were assessed by bronchoscopy and chest computed tomography scan. Results: Of the 250 children enrolled, 34% (n = 86) required transthoracic lymph node decompression, 29% as an urgent procedure and 71% (n = 63) after failing 1 month of antituberculosis treatment that included glucosteroids. Compression (less than 75%) of the bronchus intermedius (odds ratio 2.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.29 to 4.02) and left main bronchus (odds ratio 3.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.73 to 6.83) were the best predictors for lymph node decompression. Human immunodeficiency virus status, drug resistance, and malnutrition were not associated with decompression. Few complications (self-limiting, 8%) or treatment failures (2%) resulted from the decompression. There were no deaths. Conclusions: In one third of children with TB, severe airway obstruction caused by enlarged lymph nodes requires decompression. Transthoracic decompression can be safely performed with low complication, failure, and fatality rates.",0,0
3986653,Ankylosis of the temporo-mandibular joint after temporal craniotomy: a cause of difficult intubation,"It is not generally appreciated that surgery in the region of the temporal fossa commonly produces, within a few weeks, a contracture of the temporalis muscle with ""pseudo"" ankylosis of the jaw. This usually, but not always, resolves within six months. The aetiological possibilities include, singly or in combination: Postincisional scar formation within the muscle. A Volkman's contracture due to devascularization of the muscle. Organization of haematoma. It is recommended that active and passive jaw exercises be started early after surgery in the temporal fossa and that such postcraniectomy patients be carefully assessed for jaw ankylosis prior to undertaking anaesthesia.",0,0
9244033,Co-induction and laryngeal mask insertion. A comparison of thiopentone versus propofol,"Conditions for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway were assessed in 70 unpremedicated patients comparing the co-induction with midazolam-alfentanil-thiopentone and midazolam-alfentanil-propofol. Following pre-induction doses of midazolam 0.04 mg.kg-1 and alfentanil 10 micrograms.kg-1, patients received equipotent doses of either thiopentone or propofol. Whilst jaw relaxation and ease of laryngeal mask insertion were similar between the two groups, patients receiving propofol were less likely to have undesired responses requiring additional boluses of induction agent (p < 0.05). We conclude that, using these doses, propofol is superior to thiopentone for laryngeal mask airway insertion when using a co-induction technique.",0,0

This disorder is characterized by progressive trismus and the need for repeated surgeries. Children intubated orally on a prior occasion may require an alternative approach subsequently due to progressive inability to open the mouth. An antegrade fiberoptic-guided nasotracheal technique initially was chosen due to extremely limited mouth opening.

1739564,"Effects of posture, phonation and observer on Mallampati classification","We have studied the effects of phonation and posture on the Mallampati classification of view of the pharyngeal structures. Differences between observers were allowed for by the experimental design and log-linear modelling. Sixty-four patients were assessed on the ward, sitting upright, with and without phonation, by each of two observers. Another 64 patients were assessed without phonation, but both upright and supine, again by both observers. Phonation (the patient saying ""Ah"") produced a marked, systematic improvement of view; moving to the supine posture produced a small, systematic, non-significant worsening of the view. Differences between observers were non-systematic but substantial. About 25% of patients phonated spontaneously. It is recommended that anaesthetists make their own assessments of Mallampati classification, with the patient in either of the postures but always either with or without phonation, and thereby gradually ""calibrate"" their assessments against the degree of difficulty encountered in intubation.",0,0
7060387,Tracheal tube forces on the posterior larynx: index of laryngeal loading,"Most tracheal tubes sold today are arcuate in shape while the human airway is S-shaped. In situ, the tubes exert different forces on the posterior larynx, depending on their stiffness. Laryngeal damage after prolonged intubation is recognized as the result of these forces. The authors tested 8 types of size 8.0 tracheal tubes to determine the magnitude of laryngeal loading in a model approximating the geometry of the human airway. The force each tube exerted on the posterior larynx was measured in conditions simulating both, immediately after intubation and after prolonged intubation of 24 h. The force was converted into an integer number, an index of laryngeal loading, that can be used to compare various types of tracheal tubes. The airway model and test procedure can be utilized by manufactures, designers, and others to provide valuable information on tracheal tube performance and to develop improved tracheal tubes in the future. The results indicate that the polyvinylchloride tubes (PVC) and the silicone rubber tubes had the lowest index of laryngeal loading after long-term conditioning and would be preferable for prolonged intubation. The red rubber tube had the highest index of laryngeal loading after long-term conditioning, yet its stiffness would facilitate intubation.",0,0
14592304,Sleep and breathing in professional football players,"Objectives: To evaluate sleep in professional football players and describe clinical features of players at risk for sleep for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Methods: The Multivariable Apnea Prediction (MAP) index was used to stratify players into high (MAP> or =0.5) and low (MAP<0.5) risk for SDB. Players from both risk groups were randomly selected for overnight polysomnography, with over-sampling from the High-risk group. Of 302 players from eight professional football teams; 52 underwent attended polysomnography. Anthropometrics including neck circumference, airway size (Mallampati score, maxillary overjet) and sleepiness measured by Epworth scores (ESS) were recorded. The primary outcome measures were ESS and an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > or =10. Results: Ninety-two percent of players were <30 years old (mean (SD) age: 25.5+/-2.7 years) with large necks (45.2+/-3.6 cm) and elevated BMI (31.5+/-4.6). More than 20% of players had an ESS>10 with ESS highest in habitual snorers. An AHI of > or =10 was found in 13 (34%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 21-50%) high-risk players but only one (7%, 95% CI 1-31%) of 14 low-risk players. Offensive (9) or defensive (3) linemen accounted for the majority of the positive cases. Based on our sample, we estimate the prevalence of SDB to be 14% (2-25%). Conclusions: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is present in a large fraction of professional football players. Some but not all of this may be due to an increased prevalence of SDB. Further study is required to understand all of the factors responsible for EDS and to determine which of the biggest players will have SDB, which may impact not only performance and productivity but also future health.",0,0
25385564,Ludwig's angina: need for including airways and larynx in ultrasound evaluation,"Ludwig's angina is a deep neck space infection. Unlike other abscesses elsewhere in the body, rapid progression of the disease results in serious complications such as airway oedema, distortion, total obstruction with loss of airway and death. Thus, early diagnosis and skilful airway management is necessary. For safe airway management, fibreoptic intubation or tracheostomy under local anaesthesia is recommended.1 We describe a case report where an initial attempt at fibreoptic intubation failed and subsequently bleeding ensued causing difficulty in viewing the larynx by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Radiological investigations such as ultrasound and computer tomography (CT) are commonly ordered by surgeons and emergency physicians to know the extension of disease, but airways and larynx are seldom included.

Airway management may be difficult despite a normal airway examination due to impingement of a thyroid mass on the laryngeal and tracheal structures. Anesthetists must be prepared to use emergency airway adjuncts in case a patient cannot be ventilated or intubated. Because sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity is associated with increased amounts of thyroid hormone, it is essential that all patients having an elective thyroidectomy be in a euthyroid state before surgery. There are multiple preoperative antithyroid medication regimens that effectively treat thyroid hormone hypersecretion. However, although a rare event, thyroid storm can still occur during the perioperative period. Anesthetic considerations and surgical complications are presented.",0,0

Methods: A total of 216 patients underwent DISE between November 23, 2011, and May 1, 2015. DISE findings based on VOTE classification were compared between patients receiving the propofol- and dexmedetomidine-based sedation protocols. Results: Patients with OSA (N = 216; age, 44.3 ± 11.7 years; body mass index, 27.9 ± 4.8 kg/m(2)) underwent DISE with intravenous administration of propofol (n = 52) or dexmedetomidine (n = 164). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in baseline apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, Mallampati score, tonsil size, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, peripheral oxygen saturation nadir, age, sex, or body mass index. Patients in the propofol group had a significantly increased likelihood of demonstrating complete tongue base obstruction (75%, 39 of 52) versus partial or no obstruction (25%, 13 of 52) in the anterior-posterior dimension, as compared with the dexmedetomidine group (complete obstruction: 42.7%, 70 of 164; partial or no obstruction: 57.3%, 94 of 164; odds ratio: 4.0; 95% confidence interval: 2.0-8.1; P = .0001). Obstruction of other airway subsites was not significantly different. Conclusion: Use of propofol versus dexmedetomidine to induce sedation may have a significant effect on the pattern of upper airway obstruction observed during DISE. Randomized prospective studies are indicated to confirm these initial findings.",0,0
25844128,"Comparison of the rate of successful endotracheal intubation between the ""sniffing"" and ""ramped"" positions in patients with an expected difficult intubation: a prospective randomized study","Background: Optimal head and neck positioning and clinical experience are important factors for successful endotracheal intubation in patients with a difficult airway. This study aimed to investigate the rate of successful endotracheal intubation between the sniffing and ramped positions in patients with an expected difficult intubation. Methods: The study included 204 patients with an expected difficult intubation (airway difficulty score ≥ 8) based on the preoperative airway assessment. The patients were randomized into the following groups: group S was placed in the sniffing position, and group R was placed in the ramped position during direct laryngoscopy. The primary outcome was successful endotracheal intubation and the secondary measure was laryngeal view in the ramped or sniffing position when the operating table was placed at two different heights. Results: Group R showed a higher rate of successful endotracheal intubation and better laryngeal view than group S (P < 0.05). The rate of successful endotracheal intubation was higher in group R than in group S at both heights of the operating table; but, it was not different within each group. Laryngeal view was not different between the two groups and within each group when the two heights of the operating table were used. Fully trained and experienced attending anesthesiologists achieved a higher rate of successful endotracheal intubation than less experienced residents in group R (P < 0.05) but not in group S. Conclusions: Ramped position and clinical experience can be important factors for laryngeal view and success rate of endotracheal intubation in patients with an expected difficult intubation.",0,0
9352759,Predicting difficult intubation--a comprehensive scoring system,"A study was conducted in an attempt to devise a simple and more accurate method of predicting difficult intubation. Prospective assessments were made in 282 patients and retrospective assessment in 16 patients with regard to 21 anatomical factors which were correlated with the laryngoscopic view at intubation. Twelve factors correlated significantly with difficult intubation. Four of these were eliminated after multifactorial analysis. A scoring system was devised, assigning points to each variable based on its discriminative value. A score of 6 or more correctly identified 22 out of the 23 difficult intubations and there were 50 false positives (sensitivity, specificity and PPV of 96%, 82% and 31% respectively). When negative scoring was done for factors favouring easy intubation, false positives were reduced to 36, but only 20 difficult cases could be identified correctly.",1,1
18806035,A new curved laryngoscope blade for routine and difficult tracheal intubation,"We have designed a new curved laryngoscope blade based on a new concept of reversing the peardrop phenomenon to facilitate a view of the larynx sufficient for intubation in a greater variety of patients than the current Macintosh blade affords. The new design has a bifid tip and S-shaped spatula to exert more effective pressure in the vallecula area, elevate the epiglottis and change directions of the forces on the tongue to prevent posteroinferior displacement of the compressed tongue in the submandibular space during laryngoscopy. A radiograph laryngoscopy technique was used to guide the new blade curvature design and compare the performance of the new blade with the Macintosh blade in patients with or without a difficult airway. Our results confirm that the new blade provides a laryngeal view sufficient to accomplish intubation by compressing the root of the tongue in an anterocephalad direction in the submandibular space and elevating the epiglottis effectively in patients with or without unanticipated difficult airway. The new curved blade can also effectively move the U-shaped epiglottis out of the laryngeal view to facilitate intubation in pediatric patients aged 2 mo-13 yr.",0,0
17400984,Case series: the McGrath videolaryngoscope--an initial clinical evaluation,"Purpose: To document tracheal intubation success rates and airway instrumentation times using the newly designed McGrath videolaryngoscope. Methods: We prospectively recorded factors associated with difficult tracheal intubation, factors causing actual difficulty in tracheal intubation, as well as complications arising from use of the new McGrath videolaryngoscope in a series of adult patients with normal preoperative airway examinations. All patients were undergoing scheduled or elective surgery. In the first 75 patients (phase I), experience with airway instrumentation was documented, while in the second 75 patients (phase II), the time required to obtain an optimal view of the larynx was recorded, as well as the time to complete tracheal intubation. Results: Ninety-eight percent of all tracheal intubations were successful using the McGrath videolaryngoscope. Cormack and Lehane grade I views were obtained in 143 patients (95%) and grade II views were achieved in six (4%). In phase II, the median time required to obtain an adequate view was 6.3 sec [interquartile range 4.7-8.7 (range 2-26.3)], and to complete tracheal intubation was 24.7 sec [18.5-34.4 (11.4-286)]. Fortynine (65%) of the tracheal intubations were completed within 30 sec, and 72 (96%) were completed within one minute. No complications were encountered in any patient. Conclusions: The McGrath videolaryngoscope is an effective aid to airway management in patients with normal airways, based upon intubation success rates and the ability to rapidly secure the airway. Its potential advantages of convenience and portability warrant further evaluation in comparison with other airway devices and in patients with difficult airways.",0,0
24092512,The Clarus Video System stylet for awake intubation in a very difficult urgent intubation,"Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFI) is a standard method of airway management in a case of anticipated difficult intubation. It is usually performed using flexible fibroscopes. In this report, we describe the case of a 42 year-old female patient who suffered from congenital disease producing severe deformation of the head, face, neck and chest. In this case, the AFI procedure was performed successfully using a rigid intubation stylet: the Clarus Video System. One of the advantages of rigid stylets is that they are very easy to use, and in the hands of anaesthesiologists not very familiar with fibroscope intubation, they can be an alternative to flexible fibroscopes in AFI procedures.",0,0

21625969,Epidural anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in a patient with post-traumatic cervical syringomyelia,"Purpose: To illustrate the successful management of a patient with post-traumatic syringomyelia (PTS) and chronic pain syndrome who presented for elective Cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia. Clinical findings: A 30-yr-old gravida 3 para 1 woman, with a known diagnosis of cervical PTS secondary to a whiplash injury sustained three years earlier, presented to the labour and delivery unit at 31 weeks' gestation. She had severe pain in the cervical and lumbar spine, motor and sensory deficits in the upper extremities, tender mass in her left trapezius muscle, and history of dizziness and syncopal episodes. She was taking oxycodone 120 mg·day(-1) Magnetic resonance imaging of her spine revealed a syrinx of 2 mm in diameter extending from C4 to T1 levels with disc protrusions in the C4-C6 region. There was no evidence of Arnold-Chiari malformation or elevated intracranial pressure. On airway examination, her Mallampati score appeared normal, but there was a limitation in the range of her neck movements in all directions. An elective Cesarean delivery was planned at 39 weeks' gestation. An epidural catheter was placed using ultrasound guidance, and the procedure was performed without complications. Conclusions: The successful management of this case suggests that epidural can be considered in women with cervical PTS presenting for a Cesarean delivery.",0,0
11758329,[Propofol-fentanyl anesthesia for a 13-year-old patient with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome],"We report anesthetic management of a 13-year-old boy with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome for urethral fistulectomy using propofol-fentanyl anesthesia. The syndrome has three major symptoms; exomphalos, macroglossia and gigantism. Other complications including neonatal hypoglycemia, visceromegaly, metabolic disorders, malignant tumors, and cardiovascular abnormalities may also be seen. This patient was complicated with gigantism, exomphalos, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, hepatoblastoma, accessory mammae, and left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block. A comprehensive preoperative examination should include assessment of the airway, cardiovascular conditions, endocrine status, blood glucose, and electrolytes.

8368059,AANA journal course: update for nurse anesthetists--beyond the laryngoscope: advanced techniques for difficult airway management,"Airway catastrophes have been identified as the leading cause of injury and death during anesthesia. Proper management of a patient with a technically difficult airway commences with problem recognition. Physical limitations to mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation may be accurately identified by thorough observation. All patients should be examined for oral structure visibility, size of mandibular space, and ability to assume ""sniffing"" position. Patients with compromised airways should have patency secured while remaining awake by direct laryngoscopy, nasotracheal intubation, fiberoptic endoscopy, retrograde intubation, or possibly tracheostomy. Partial or complete airway obstruction requires immediate recognition and intervention. Repeated, unsuccessful attempts at endotracheal intubation should be avoided, as these may lead to laryngeal edema or hemorrhage which may critically compromise airway maintenance. Prudent options may include awakening the patient, proceeding with mask ventilation, or performing semi-elective tracheostomy. Emergency airway access may be achieved with a tracheoesophageal airway, esophageal tracheal combitube, laryngeal mask airway, digital intubation, or obtained surgically by transtracheal jet ventilation or tracheostomy. Reduction of airway-related morbidity and mortality is best achieved with an understanding of airway anatomy, common causes and prompt recognition of compromise, and alternative techniques of establishing patency and ventilation.",0,0
18440757,[Why should we inform the patients after difficult tracheal intubation?],"Unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation may be challenging to anaesthesiologists. It is still associated with morbidity or mortality. Previous difficult intubation is vital information to organize appropriate airway management. Unfortunately, previous studies in the literature have shown that there is poor communication of this information. We propose in this article an airway alert form, following several criteria published in the literature. This is, in our opinion, an important step to improve the efficiency of guidelines on airway management and the overall quality of the anaesthesia process. Its efficacy to decrease morbidity related to difficult tracheal intubation remains to be demonstrated.",0,0
16192549,Airway management in the lateral position: a randomized controlled trial,"It may be required to ensure patency of the airway in the lateral position in certain circumstances. We performed a prospective randomized clinical trial investigating the effects of left lateral patient positioning on airway anatomy and subsequent airway management. Laryngoscopic airway examination was performed in anesthetized patients, in the supine and left lateral positions, and in the presence and absence of cricoid pressure. Patients were randomized to airway management via an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway (LMA). The left lateral position resulted in a deterioration of laryngoscopic view in 35% of patients and improvement in none. In the lateral position, failure of airway management occurred in more patients with the endotracheal tube versus LMA (8 of 39 versus 1 of 30; P = 0.03), and the mean time to successful completion of airway management was longer with tracheal intubation compared with the LMA (39 +/- 19 s versus 26 +/- 12 s; P = 0.002). LMA use results in more reliable airway control compared to tracheal intubation in the lateral position. The LMA should be considered as the primary airway device when instituting airway management in this position. Implications: Inadequate airway management may be fatal. There are recommendations for airway difficulties, but the evidence favoring any specific strategy is limited. This study suggests that, in the lateral position, a laryngeal mask airway more rapidly and reliably establishes airway control than attempts at endotracheal intubation. It further suggests that placing a patient with an inadequate airway into the lateral position will hinder, not help, airway management.",0,0
23575169,A retrospective review of difficult intubations: is obstructive sleep apnea a predictor?,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with difficult intubation in patients undergoing general anesthesia requiring tracheal intubation. Methods: Using a retrospective, case-control study design, 90 adults with difficult tracheal intubation were compared with 81 gender-matched controls, between 2007 and 2010. Analyses included descriptive and inferential statistics, and multivariate regression was used to estimate predictors of difficult intubation while adjusting for patient demographics. Results: In the univariate analysis, OSA was not associated with difficult intubation. After patient factors were controlled for in the multivariate logistic regression, patients without OSA were more likely to have difficult intubation (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.99; P = .048). Other predictors of difficult intubation were lower body mass index and higher Mallampati score. Discussion: In adult subjects, OSA history was not a predictor of difficult intubation. Other patient or anesthesiologist factors should be assessed for their association with difficult intubation.",0,0
9813520,Influence of cuff volume on oropharyngeal leak pressure and fibreoptic position with the laryngeal mask airway,"We studied the size 4 laryngeal mask airway (LMA) to test the hypothesis that oropharyngeal leak pressure and fibreoptic position improves with increasing cuff volume. After LMA insertion, 50 anaesthetized adult patients had the cuff inflated in 5-ml increments to 40 ml. Oropharyngeal leak pressure was optimal at 15 ml and decreased at higher volumes. The fibreoptic position was optimal at 0-20 ml and deteriorated at higher volumes. Gastric insufflation was detected more frequently when the cuff volume exceeded 20 ml. We conclude that inflation of the size 4 LMA to the maximum recommended volume provides suboptimal conditions and that this value should be reduced from 30 to 20 ml.",0,0
23880923,The use of a mandibular repositioning device for obstructive sleep apnea,"The objective of this study was to verify the effect of a mandibular repositioning device (MRD) on polysomnographic parameters and on the mean electromyographic activity of the masseter and temporal muscles in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). This is a prospective cohort study conducted at multidisciplinary OSAS center in a tertiary referral center. Nineteen individuals with mild or moderate OSAS associated with Mallampati 3-4 were treated with an MRD during sleep. The subjects underwent diurnal electromyography (EM) and nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) examinations both prior and after initial treatment (3 months with MRD for PSG and 6 and 12 months of treatment for EM). The examinations performed at different times were compared. Comparison of the initial and final polysomnography examination revealed a significant mean reduction of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 13.8 to 7.8. The successful treatment rate with the MRD was 52.6%, and the improved treatment rate was 68.4%. Patients with lower pre-treatment AHI presented higher rates of cure. There was no statistically significant change in electromyography examination among different times. The MRD reduced the apnea-hypopnea index in individuals with enlarged base of tongue and mild and moderate OSAS without damaging the function of the masseter and temporal muscles as determined by electromyography.",0,0
22574748,Routine intubation in the prone position,"Background: Tracheal intubation in the prone position has previously been reported only as a necessity in a very few emergency situations. It emerged at our clinic as a routine after invention of a test aimed at pinpointing a painful motion segment in patients with chronic low back pain who were candidates for lumbar fusion operation. Material and methods: During a 6-year period 247 consecutive patients were treated at our clinic, 91 men and 156 women, mean age 42.8 years, range 25.3-62.8. Classification of the pharyngeal structures according to Mallampati et al. was done the day before surgery, and grading of visualization of the glottis as described by Cormack and Lehane was done during intubation, with the aim of revealing factors of importance for the possibility of performing tracheal intubation in the prone position. Results: The large majority of patients classified preoperatively as Mallampati class 1 had Cormack and Lehane grade 1 at laryngoscopy, although some patients had grades 2, 3, and 4. Most problems with intubation in the prone position were anticipated among those classified preoperatively as Mallampati class 3, but tracheal intubation in the prone position was still possible in 21 of the 23 patients in this group. In all, tracheal intubation in the prone position was successful in 244 of the 247 patients (98.8%). Conclusion: Routine tracheal intubation in the prone position can be performed effectively by experienced anaesthesiologists, but this requires continuous training and good support from the anaesthesiology staff.",0,0
26111264,"Conventional Versus Video Laryngoscopy for Tracheal Tube Exchange: Glottic Visualization, Success Rates, Complications, and Rescue Alternatives in the High-Risk Difficult Airway Patient","Background: Tracheal tube exchange is a simple concept but not a simple procedure because hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, and loss of airway may occur with life-threatening ramifications. Combining laryngoscopy with an airway exchange catheter (AEC) may lessen the exchange risk. Laryngoscopy is useful for a pre-exchange examination and to open a pathway for endotracheal tube (ETT) passage. Direct laryngoscopy (DL) is hampered by a restricted ""line of sight""; thus, airway assessment and exchange may proceed blindly and contribute to difficulty and complications. We hypothesized that video laryngoscopy (VL), when compared with DL, will improve glottic viewing for airway assessment, and the VL-AEC method of ETT exchange will result in a reduction in airway and hemodynamic complications in high-risk patients when compared with a historical group of patients who underwent DL + AEC-assisted exchange. Methods: Critically ill patients requiring an ETT exchange underwent DL-assisted pre-exchange airway assessment. If the DL-assisted pre-exchange assessment rendered a ""poor view,"" these patients underwent a VL-based airway assessment followed by a VL-assisted ETT exchange procedure. The DL and VL pre-exchange assessments were compared. The attempts, complications, and rescue devices required for ETT exchange were analyzed. These exchange results were then compared with a historical control group of patients who (1) were classified as a poor view on DL-assisted pre-exchange airway assessment; and (2) underwent a DL + AEC-assisted exchange. The airway assessment and ETT exchange were performed by a board-certified anesthesiologist from the Department of Anesthesiology alone or with anesthesia resident assistance. Results: Three hundred twenty-eight patients with a poor view on initial DL examination underwent a subsequent VL with comparison of views with the 337 patients in the historical control group (DL + AEC). A majority (88%) had a ""full or near-full view"" on VL examination. The first-pass success rate for ETT exchange was greater in the VL group (91.5% vs 67.7% with DL; P = 0.0001) and the number of patients requiring 3+ attempts was lower (1.2% vs 6.8% with DL; P = 0.0003). A commensurate difference in the incidence of mild and severe hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, bradycardia, and the need for rescue airway device intervention was also observed with VL exchange procedures when compared with the historical DL + AEC group. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that VL may result in better glottic viewing for airway assessment and may permit the ETT exchange procedure to be performed with fewer airway and hemodynamic complications. Execution of the ETT exchange over an AEC was augmented by improved glottic visualization to allow more efficient and timely ETT passage. Multiple attempts to resecure the airway increased the number of exchange complications. VL + AEC exchange led to fewer attempts and is consistent with the recommendation of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Difficult Airway Task Force to limit laryngoscopic attempts and, as a consequence, decrease complications. A VL-based pre-exchange airway assessment may be a valuable procedure for both planning the exchange and uncovering unrecognized airway maladies, for example, partial or complete self-extubation.",0,0
10339948,[A case of difficult intubation with tracheobronchial anomaly],"We experienced a case of difficult intubation with tracheobronchial anomaly. A 66-year-old male was scheduled for subtotal esophagectomy. We used a univent bronchial blocker tube (UBT) to separate the lungs because of difficulty with tracheal intubation using a 37 F double lumen tube (DLT). Intraoperatively, we could not separate the lungs due to tracheobronchial anomaly in the right lung, and attempted to change the tube. We could insert a 35 F DLT to the trachea and separate the lungs. In the case of difficult or impossible conventional direct-vision intubation, the use of DLT is a relative contraindication. However, in this case, the separation of the lungs with UBT was difficult because of tracheobronchial anomaly.",0,0

This makes the light stylet a valuable alternative when conventional intubation with a laryngoscope is difficult or impossible. Intubation with the light stylet is easy to learn, is relatively atraumatic, has an acceptable success rate and is fast enough to compete with laryngoscopic intubation. The equipment is inexpensive. We describe successful intubation with the light stylet in four patients. Two had unstable neck fractures, one had previously been difficult to intubate, and one had trismus.",0,0
12712873,[Anesthesia and fibrobronchoscopy for the study of chronic stridor in a boy with Robinow syndrome],"Robinow's syndrome involves fetal facial features, short stature, brachymelia, hypoplastic genitals and a normal karyotype. A 10-year-old boy with Robinow's syndrome was scheduled for study of chronic stridor by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Airway exploration with the patient awake revealed hipertelorism, retromicrognathia, poor dental alignment, macroglossia and class IV Mallampati. After anesthetic induction in spontaneous ventilation with 5% sevoflurane, grade IV Cormack-Lehane conditions were observed. A laryngeal mask was placed without muscle relaxation after which the boy was ventilated manually for several minutes without stridor. Anesthetic maintenance was with 3% sevoflurane in 50% oxygen and air. After recovery of spontaneous ventilation, marked stridor presented along with a decrease in oxygen saturation and expired fractions of sevoflurane and CO2. Pulse oxymetry did not increase with increased FiO2. However, when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was set al 10 cm H2O, pulse oxymetry did increase; likewise, expired and inspired sevoflurane concentrations became equal, and expired CO2 increased. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed an area of intrathoracic tracheomalacia, which collapsed partially during spontaneous expiration and collapsed less when CPAP was started. We discuss the relation between the facial dysmorphia characteristic of this syndrome and the possibility of finding a difficult airway, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of intrathoracic tracheomalacia during anesthesia.",0,0
18043055,Dynamic interaction of craniofacial structures during head positioning and direct laryngoscopy in anesthetized patients with and without difficult laryngoscopy,"Background: We lack fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms of difficult laryngoscopy despite its clinical significance. The aim of this study was to examine how head positioning and direct laryngoscopy alter arrangements of craniofacial structures. Methods: Digital photographs of the lateral view of the head and neck were taken at each step of head positioning and direct laryngoscopy in age- and body mass index-matched patients with (n = 13) and without (n = 13) difficult laryngoscopy during general anesthesia with muscle paralysis. The images were used for measurements of various craniofacial dimensions. Results: Both simple neck extension and the sniffing position produced a caudal shift of the mandible and a downward shift of the larynx, resulting in an increase of the submandibular space. Direct laryngoscopy during the sniffing position displaced the mandible and tongue base upward and caudally, and the larynx downward and caudally, increasing the submandibular space and facilitating vertical arrangement of the mandible, tongue base, and larynx to the facial line. These structural arrangements in response to direct laryngoscopy were not observed in patients with difficult laryngoscopy, whereas head positioning produced similar structural arrangements in patients with and without difficult laryngoscopy. Conclusion: Increase in the submandibular space and a vertical arrangement of the mandible, tongue base, and larynx to the facial line seem to be important mechanisms for improving the laryngeal view during head positioning and direct laryngoscopy. Failure of these structural arrangements in response to direct laryngoscopy may result in difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
20036127,Upper lip bite test in a patient with McCune Albright syndrome with acromegaly,"We report a patient with McCune Albright syndrome with acromegaly and features predictive of difficult airway except a class I upper lip bite (ULB) test. Our patient, a 33-year-old woman, had a history of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Tracheal intubation was performed under general anaesthesia. Although we did not find any difficulty in visualizing the glottis by direct laryngoscopy; our patient had multiple poor predictive signs of airway assessment including a Mallampati grade III, restricted neck movement and macroglossia. Our report suggests that the ULB test in people with acromegaly may act as an indicator of easy intubation in spite of other poor predictive signs. However, this finding needs further corroboration by a large study to evaluate the role of the ULB test in people with acromegaly.",0,0
17959593,Responsive Contingency Planning: a novel system for anticipated difficulty in airway management in dental abscess,"Background: This study is of a novel system for management of anticipated difficult airway (Responsive Contingency Planning). It is based on the notion that almost all problems in airway management have already been experienced, so they can be anticipated and prepared for using 'worst case' planning. Methods: Anaesthetic colleagues were introduced to the new system. Thirty-two patients with dental abscess were recruited for anaesthetic airway management based around the new scheme. Data collection involved a preoperative assessment of problems specific to dental abscess, fascia-spaces involved, details of the contingency planning process, laryngoscopy grade, and comments regarding the efficacy of the new system. Results: No problems were encountered that had not been anticipated during planning and colleagues' comments about using the system were generally favourable. Examples are highlighted to suggest how the planning may have avoided certain complications (e.g. abscess rupture) and helped in dealing with others when they occurred. If trismus (</=2 cm inter-incisor distance) occurred with superficial infection alone, it always improved (to >2 cm) after induction of anaesthesia. In contrast, difficult laryngoscopy (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 6/15 cases of floor of mouth infection. Conclusions: The system fulfilled expectations for its use at this stage of development. It can be easily updated for refinements, alternative techniques, and tailoring to any difficult airway scenario. Computerization should make it easier to use and flag-up inconsistencies. Floor of mouth infections in the presence of trismus are easily underestimated and require careful assessment.",0,0
11270007,Management of difficult intubation,"Appropriate airway management is an essential part of the anaesthetist's role. Difficult intubation, which can now be quantified using the 'Intubation Difficulty Scale', should be anticipated whenever possible. A strategy needs to be developed in order to anticipate problems. The first part of this paper reviews the different factors that contribute to make intubation and/or ventilation difficult. Problems with intubation (or ventilation of the lungs) can be caused by abnormal laryngeal structures (e.g. tumour, stenosis), or by difficulty in seeing the glottis. The clinical history will usually help identify the former problem, while physical examination of the airway is required to reveal either disproportion between the various structures of the airway (e.g. tongue, larynx), and/or difficulties in aligning the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes. The different techniques used to diagnose these problems are described. The second part of this paper summarizes the algorithms used by the anaesthetist when management of the airway is found difficult. Three situations are considered: (a) anticipated difficult intubation, for which awake fibreoptic intubation would appear to be the technique of choice in the majority of cases, (b) unforeseen difficult intubation in a patient whose lungs can be ventilated; here, various techniques for control of the airway will be briefly described, and (c) both tracheal intubation and lung ventilation are impossible; this is a life-threatening emergency, for which three solutions are proposed. These include use of the laryngeal mask airway, the Combitube, or transtracheal ventilation. These situations will be analysed with the aim of proposing management strategies that always guarantee the safety of the patient.",0,0
1476291,[Difficult intubation managed by laryngeal mask and fibroscopy],"A case is reported of a patient due to undergo a combined kidney and pancreas transplant who proved to be difficult to intubate. This diabetic hypertensive 35-year-old male patient also had ankylosing spondylitis. Mouth opening was normal (more than fingers' breadth), the chin-sternum distance was 4 cm on full cervical flexion, and cervical extension was only slightly impaired. The Mallampati score was 1. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone, fentanyl and 6 mg of pancuronium. Mask ventilation was quite satisfactory. However, on laryngoscopy, the vocal cords could not be seen. Several attempts to carry out endotracheal intubation, including with a stylet, failed. A laryngeal mask (LM) was therefore applied to ventilate the patient correctly. It was not possible to pass a small endotracheal tube (6 mm diameter) through the LM tube, probably because of a small malposition of this latter. A paediatric fibroscope, passed through the LM tube, served as guide for the endotracheal tube. The mask was not removed, although its cushion was slightly deflated, so as not to extubate the patient. The benefits and usefulness of a laryngeal mask in predictable and unpredictable cases of difficult intubation are discussed.",0,0

The design of this laryngoscope is based on the standard Macintosh blade and it is attached to a standard handle. The characteristics of this laryngoscope are the hinged blade tip, which is controlled by a lever attached to the blade. The elevation of the blade tip makes it easy to visualise the larynx while the overall laryngoscopic movement decreases. Therefore this laryngoscope reduces the force employed during laryngoscopy and eliminates contact with the upper teeth. It does not require any special training in its use.

Methods: A sample of 234 patients volunteered for the study. Mallampati classifications were performed by 21 dental hygiene students for patients during a 12 month period. During that same time period, the clinic dentist performed an independent assessment on the same patients. Quantitative research methods were used to evaluate the inter-rater reliability between dental hygiene students and the clinical dentist in performing the Mallampati classification. The data was analyzed using adjusted McNemar test for non-independent data, Kappa score and percentage of agreement with 95% bootstrap confidence interval. Results: There was an agreement between the dental hygiene student and the dentist in the majority of the independent assessments with a p-value=0.498 from the adjusted McNemar test. Inter-rater agreement measured by Cohen's Kappa coefficient was 0.54 with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval of 0.42, 0.64. The percentage agreement was around 77% with a 95% confidence interval of 72%, 82%. Conclusion: It was concluded that dental hygiene students can evaluate and classify the pharyngeal soft tissues comparable to a supervising dentist in the clinical dental hygiene setting.",0,0
9203889,The effect of single-handed cricoid pressure on neck movement after applying manual in-line stabilisation,"In 30 ASA 1 and 2 patients undergoing general anaesthesia and neuromuscular paralysis, manual in-line stabilisation of the neck in a neutral position was performed and single-handed cricoid pressure was applied. Vertical displacement was measured from the midpoint of the neck (directly below the cricoid cartilage). Measurements were also made at the tragus of the ear and the shoulder; both of which acted as fixed reference points. Mean neck displacement was 4.6 mm with a range of 0-8 mm. Mean tragus and shoulder displacements were 0.5 mm and 0.9mm, respectively, with a range of 0-2 mm at each point. Vertical displacement was also measured in 10 patients from a stylet fixed to the posterior aspect of the neck. Mean displacement measured at this point was 5.0 mm with a range of 2-9 mm. Single-handed cricoid pressure caused vertical displacement of the neck of between 4.6 and 5 mm with a range of 0-9 mm. Only some of this movement, i.e. 0.5-0.9 mm (range 0-2mm) can be accounted for by displacement of the whole patient as determined from measurements at the two fixed reference points. These findings have implications for emergency management of the airway in trauma patients.",0,0
18713905,Patients with difficult intubation may need referral to sleep clinics,"Purpose: Upper airway abnormalities carry the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and difficult tracheal intubations. Both conditions contribute to significant clinical problems and have increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that patients who presented with difficult intubation would have a very high prevalence of OSA and that those with unexpected difficult intubation may require referral to sleep clinics for polysomnography (PSG). Methods: Patients classified as a grade 4 Cormack and Lehane on direct laryngoscopic view, and who required more than two attempts for successful endotracheal intubation, were referred to the study by consultant anesthesiologists at four hospitals. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) data and postoperative events were collected. Patients with AHI >5/h were considered positive for OSA. Clinical and PSG variables were compared using t-tests and chi(2) test. Results: Over a 20-mo period, 84 patients with a difficult intubation were referred into the study. Thirty-three patients agreed to participate. Sixty-six percent (22 of 33) had OSA (AHI >5/h). Of the 22 OSA patients, 10 patients (64%) had mild OSA (AHI 5-15), 6 (18%) had moderate OSA (AHI >15/h), and 6 (18%) had severe OSA (AHI >30/h). Of the 33 patients, 11 patients (33%) were recommended for continuous positive airway pressure treatment. Between the OSA group and the non-OSA group, there were significant differences in gender, neck size, and the quality of sleep, but there were no significant differences in age and body mass index. Conclusions: Sixty-six percent of patients with unexpected difficult intubation who consented to undergo a sleep study were diagnosed with OSA by PSG. Patients with difficult intubation are at high risk for OSA and should be screened for signs and symptoms of sleep apnea. Screening for OSA should be considered by referral to a sleep clinic for PSG.",0,0
17261212,Comparison between lecture-based approach and case/problem-based learning discussion for teaching pre-anaesthetic assessment,"Background and objective: The case/problem-based learning discussion method was recently introduced into the theory-based training program for residents run by the Catalan Society of Anaesthesiology. This study was designed to assess and compare its effectiveness with that of the lecture-based approach for teaching pre-anaesthetic assessment, applying an objective tool for knowledge evaluation before and after teaching. Methods: A prospective randomized study of two consecutive year groups of first year anaesthesiology residents was conducted. Twenty-nine residents attended a lecture, and 25, a case/problem-based learning discussion session. Their knowledge of pre-anaesthetic assessment was assessed before and after the teaching session with tests on four different clinical cases measuring six fields: (1) 'recognizing clinical data with anaesthetic implications'; (2) 'reasoning clinical data with anaesthetic implications'; (3) 'ASA class'; (4) 'Mallampati class'; (5) 'choice of anaesthetic technique'; (6) 'reasoning choice of anaesthetic technique'. Results: Before the teaching session, the lecture group scored significantly higher on field 1 (P = 0.006). Both teaching methods improved scores on fields 1, 2 and 4. The case/problem group also improved on fields 3 and 6. After the teaching session, the field 1 score was still significantly higher in the lecture group (P = 0.005), and the field 3 score was significantly higher in the case/problem group (P = 0.044). Conclusions: The effectiveness of lecture and case/problem-based learning discussion differed little in terms of improving participants' immediate knowledge of 'pre-anaesthetic assessment'.",0,0
9717423,Anesthesia for morbidly obese patients,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective method for treating patients with morbid obesity, and participation of the anesthesiologist in the treatment of these patients is more and more frequent. Therefore it is important for anesthesiologists to be familiar with anatomic and physiologic implications and the pharmacologic changes associated with obesity, so they can offer optimal perioperative treatment. The present study describes a series of 37 patients with an average body mass index of 50.3 kg/m2 who underwent bariatric surgery in a third-level teaching hospital in Mexico City. Preoperative assessment, airway management, perioperative treatment, and the incidence of complications are analyzed. We found a high frequency of associated diseases, among which diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension were the most prominent. Cardiorespiratory complications such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome were particularly frequent (16.2% and 22.0%, respectively). Both general anesthesia and mixed anesthesia (peridural block plus light general anesthesia) were employed. The incidence of complications related to perioperative and anesthetic management was low. We discuss and propose protocols for the evaluation and management of airway and associated cardiorespiratory complications.",0,0
23990031,Laryngeal injuries following endotracheal intubation in ENT surgery: predictive value of anatomical scores,"Endotracheal intubation has been associated with a threefold higher incidence of laryngopharyngeal complaints following anesthesia in comparison to laryngeal mask airway. Such complaints, including hoarseness and sore throat, have been reported in up to 90% of patients within 24 h of extubation. The purpose of this study was to determine which preoperatively documented clinical and anatomic parameters are predictive of laryngo-pharyngeal trauma resulting from elective endotracheal intubation. Fifty-three patients undergoing ENT procedures requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were recruited. Pre and postoperative laryngostroboscopic examination was performed and findings correlated to preoperative clinical and anatomic parameters. Readily assessed anatomic parameters including height (>180 cm) and weight (>80 kg) correlated significantly to the Eckerbom grade of intubation-associated acute laryngeal injury (rs = 0.374; p = 0.006 and rs = 0.278; p = 0.044, respectively). The mandibular protrusion test also correlated significantly to the Eckerbom grade (rs = 0.462, p = 0.001) while the upper-lip-bite test showed significant correlation to impaired vocal fold oscillation (rs = 0.288, p = 0.036), with injury prediction sensitivities of 37.5 and 39.4%, respectively. No parameters correlated to subjective complaints (n = 5, 9.2%). This study provides suggestions on how to improve the classification of intubation-associated laryngeal injuries as well as providing the basis for larger clinical trials in other surgical subspecialties.",0,0
18647291,The Soft Seal disposable laryngeal mask airway in adults: comparison of two insertion techniques without intra-oral manipulation,"We investigated whether insertion of the disposable Soft Seal laryngeal mask airway (SSLM) was successful without intra-oral digital manipulation. One hundred patients undergoing anaesthesia using the SSLM were randomly assigned into two groups. Insertion was performed by either a direct or a rotational technique, both without intra-oral digital manipulation. The primary outcome measure was successful insertion at first attempt. Other outcomes included insertion time, fibreoptic assessment of the airway view and airway morbidity. The first attempt success rate was higher (98%) with the direct technique than with the rotational technique (75%; p = 0.002) but insertion time was faster with the latter method (mean [range] 15 [8-50] s) than with the direct method (20 [8-56] s; p = 0.035). Fibreoptic assessment and airway morbidity were similar in both groups. We conclude that the SSLM can be successfully inserted without intra-oral digital manipulation.",0,0
25610049,A new technique for laryngeal mask airway insertion in a newborn with pierre-robin syndrome: a case report,"Babies with Pierre Robin syndrome have serious life-threatening risks because of acute respiratory distress and difficult airway management. It is difficult to perform endotracheal intubation in these babies for general anesthesia. We present successful insertion of laryngeal mask airway in a neonate with typical clinical features of Pierre-Robin syndrome using a size 1 laryngeal mask airway for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation. The patient had micrognathia, glossoptosis with cleft palate, and partial trismus. His mouth opening was restricted to 0.6 cm. Anesthesia was deepened with sevoflurane, maintaining spontaneous ventilation, but laryngoscopy was impossible because of the limited mouth opening. After unsuccessful attempts to insert an LMA by standard and rotational techniques, it was inserted using a novel modified rotational LMA insertion technique, which we have termed the 'squeezing technique'.",0,0
25485097,Difficult mask ventilation in general surgical population: observation of risk factors and predictors,"Background: There are few predictors of difficult mask ventilation and a simple, objective, predictive system to identify patients at risk of difficult mask ventilation does not currently exist. We present a retrospective - subgroup analysis aimed at identifying predictive factors for difficult mask ventilation (DMV) in patients undergoing pre-operative airway assessment before elective surgery at a major teaching hospital. Methods: Data for this retrospective analysis were derived from a database of airway assessments, management plans, and outcomes that were collected prospectively from August 2008 to May 2010 at a Level 1 academic trauma center. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the difficulty of mask ventilation and the cohorts were analyzed using univariate analysis and stepwise selection method. Results: A total of 1399 pre-operative assessments were completed with documentation stating that mask ventilation was attempted. Of those 1399, 124 (8.9%) patients were found to be difficult to mask ventilate. A comparison of patients with and without difficult mask ventilation identified seven risk factors for DMV: age, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, history of difficult intubation, presence of facial hair, perceived short neck and obstructive sleep apnea. Although seven risk factors were identified, no individual subject had more than four risk factors. Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that in a real world clinical setting, the incidence of DMV is not negligible and suggest the use of a simple bedside predictive score to improve the accuracy of DMV prediction, thereby improving patient safety. Further prospective studies to validate this score would be useful.",0,0
19558070,Blind nasal intubation in a child with ankylosis of temporomandibular joint,"Blind nasal intubation has been one of the favoured methods of intubating the trachea in patients with restricted mouth opening and thus a difficult laryngoscopy and oro-tracheal intubation. Here, we describe airway management of patient who presented with traumatic ankylosis of the right temporomandibular joint and reduced mouth opening that was planned for elective release of the ankylosis and temporalis fascia flap. Successful blind nasotracheal intubation was done and after the surgery was completed, awake extubation was done and mouth opening was significantly increased. The recovery and the post-operative periods were uneventful.",0,0
15896749,A descriptive study of small airway reticular basement membrane thickening in clinically stable lung transplant recipients,"Background: Chronic rejection functionally manifested by fixed airflow limitation, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is a major problem for all lung allograft programs. The inclusion of a pre-BOS category (BOS(0 approximately p)) in the newly revised guidelines, recognizes the potential importance of early changes. We tested the hypothesis that small airway reticular basement membrane thickening exists even in clinically stable lung transplant recipients with some evidence of inflammation but who are BOS-free. Methods: A bronchoscopic study was performed on 30 clinically stable lung allograft recipients at >/=3 months post-allograft, who were BOS-free but with some evidence of airway inflammation indicated by a pathologic diagnosis of lymphocytic bronchiolitis or raised exhaled nitric oxide (NO). After baseline physiologic assessment, small airway reticular basement membrane (Rbm) thickening was quantified in transbronchial biopsy (TBB) using image analysis, with inflammation assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) differential cell counts. Results: Twenty-one patients had technically satisfactory measurements of Rbm thickness. We detected small airway Rbm thickening when compared with published data for control lung diseases. There was no correlation between Rbm thickening and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV(1)] best post-operatively and Rbm r = -0.10, not significant). Conclusions: Our data suggest that airway remodeling can occur early in lung allografts and before development of airflow limitation and BOS. Longitudinal pathophysiologic studies are needed to elucidate potential relationships between airway inflammation, Rbm thickening and allograft failure. Airway biopsies would be of value in such studies.",0,0
24632572,The LMA-Supreme versus the I-gel in simulated difficult airway in children: a randomised study,"Background: Supraglottic airway devices such as the LMA-Supreme (LMA-S) and I-gel, which have an additional lumen for the insertion of a gastric tube, can be useful in the management of the difficult airway. Objective: To test the performance of these two devices in the difficult paediatric airway. Design: Randomised double-blind study. Setting: Anaesthesia department, university hospital. Patients: Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II children undergoing elective surgery. Intervention: After obtaining ethical approval and written informed consent from the parents, we compared the size 2 LMA-S with the I-gel in a simulated airway scenario made more difficult by using a cervical collar to limit mouth opening and neck movement. Main outcome measures: The primary aim was to compare the oropharyngeal leak pressure of the LMA-S and the I-gel. The secondary aims were to compare success rate, insertion time, time to pass a gastric tube and fibreoptic view of the larynx. Results: Oropharyngeal leak pressure (mean ± SD) for the LMA-S was significantly higher than with the I-gel (20.9 ± 3.2 versus 18.9 ± 3.2 cmH2O, P = 0.019). First attempt success rate for the LMA-S was 100 and 90% for the I-gel (P > 0.05). Insertion time of the LMA-S was shorter than I-gel (11.2 ± 1.8 versus 13.5 ± 2.4 s, P = 0.001). Gastric tube placement was possible in all patients. The mean insertion time of the gastric tube was shorter with the LMA-S than with the I-gel (10.3 ± 3.6 versus 12.7 ± 3.2 s, P = 0.009). Fibreoptic laryngeal views were similar in both groups. Conclusion: In the simulated difficult airway in children, both airway devices provided effective ventilation. Paediatric size 2 LMA-S sustained a higher airway pressure before leaking and was quicker to insert than the I-gel equivalent. These differences may not be clinically significant.",0,0
17074781,Difficult laryngoscopy made easy with the use of left-hand laryngoscope blade,"In scenarios where difficult airway is anticipated as a result of a mass or any pathology in the right side of the upper airway, the plan of approach depends on the extent of difficulty assessed by various airway assessment tests/methods. If significant difficulty is suspected some of the available options include either an awake/sedated fibreoptic or blind nasal intubations. When the airway pathology involves part of the right side or exclusively the whole of the right side compressing the airway towards the left, there is no room to position a normal right or straight blade. A left-hand laryngoscope can be used in these types of cases where anatomy and contour of the blade manoeuvres the tongue and the right-sided lesion, thereby providing an unobstructed left-sided view of the larynx. The left-hand laryngoscope blade has been useful in converting the Cormack and Lehane grade III/IV laryngoscopies to grade II in our cases where the pathology was located exclusively on the right side of the airway. These cases suggest that there may be a role of left-hand laryngoscope in the management of difficult airway, particularly, in cases where there are right-sided mass lesions obstructing the airway.",0,0
10365014,Liability of laryngeal mask airway devices to thermal damage from KTP and Nd:YAG lasers,"We have compared the liability of four laryngeal mask airway (LMA) devices (standard, flexible, intubating and reusable) and a tracheal tube to thermal damage from KTP and Nd:YAG lasers at two power densities used commonly in airway surgery: 570 W cm-2 and 1140 W cm-2. Eighty-five airway devices were tested: 24 standard LMA (silicone-based), 12 flexible LMA (silicone-based, metal wires), 24 disposable LMA (PVC-based), one intubating LMA (silicone and steel-based) and 24 PVC-based tracheal tubes. Comparisons were made during laser strike to eight different targets: the unmarked and marked part of the airway device tube; the unmarked part of the airway device tube after application of blood; the cuff filled with air or methylene blue dye; the unmarked flexible LMA tube on or between the metal wires; and the epiglottic elevator bar of the intubating LMA. The laser strike was continued for 30 s and each target was tested three times. Three different, but identical, impact sites were used for each target. There was no ignition of any airway device with either power density or laser type. The silicone-based LMA were generally more resistant to flaring and penetration than the PVC-based LMA and tracheal tube, but the intubating LMA tube flared more rapidly with the KTP laser, and the disposable LMA cuff was more resistant to penetration. Print markings, blood and the metal wires of the flexible LMA reduced the thermal resistance of the tube. Filling the cuff with methylene blue dye increased the thermal resistance of all airway devices. We conclude that the silicone-based LMA devices were more thermal resistant to KTP and Nd:YAG laser strike than PVC-based devices with the exception of the disposable LMA cuff and the intubating LMA tube.",0,0
23159019,[Orotracheal intubation difficulty with lighted stylet: correlation of body mass index and neck circumference],"Objectives: To evaluate the difficulty of intubation with a lighted stylet by correlating the body mass index (BMI) with the neck or cervical circumference (CC), and to establish the values of BMI and CC that could help identify a possible difficult intubation with this device. Patients and methods: An observational and correlational study was performed on selected patients by consecutive sampling who were intubated using the lighted stylet. Variables such as age, gender, ASA physical status, BMI, CC, transillumination intensity, Cormack-Lehane grade, and Mallampati scores, were recorded. Multivariable analyses were performed. Results: 103 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 39.0 ± 16.6 years, BMI 28.6 ± 6.8 kg/m² (33% obese and 29,1% overweight), CC 37.8 ± 4.6 cm. Those patients who presented difficulty for intubation had a CC 39.9 ± 5.2 cm (P ≤ 0.05), and a BMI 33.8 ± 7.6 kg/m² (P = 0.01). Conclusion: A lineal correlation exists between a BMI above 33 kg/m² and/or a CC greater than 40 cm and a difficult intubation using lighted stylet. Another method other than transillumination is recommended for orotracheal intubation in a patient with both characteristics.",0,0
25502155,Airway assessment of patients undergoing endoscopic procedures,"Objectives: In advance of endoscopic procedures, an evaluation to assess the risk of sedation is performed by the gastroenterologist. Based on regulations, gastroenterologists are required to perform an airway assessment. At this time, data supporting this regulation are limited; therefore, we evaluated airway assessment accuracy by gastroenterologists before endoscopic procedures. Methods: A retrospective, single tertiary care center study was performed from May 2012 through August 2013. Patients who underwent an endoscopy or colonoscopy performed at the University of Missouri-Columbia with documented Mallampati scores were included in the analysis. Three primary cohorts of patients were included in our study: gastroenterologist versus anesthesiologist, gastroenterologist versus other gastroenterologists, and gastroenterologists versus themselves. Data were collected and recorded for patient age, body mass index, and Mallampati score. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and linear weighted kappa analysis for agreement. Results: For gastroenterologists versus anesthesiologists and versus other gastroenterologists, the agreement on Mallampati scores was poor (weighted kappa index 0.103, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.0126 to 0.219; percentage of agreement 42% and 0.120, 95% CI -0.0211 to 0.260; percentage of agreement 46%, respectively). For gastroenterologists versus themselves for the same patient, the agreement on Mallampati scores was only moderate (weighted kappa index 0.420, 95% CI 0.119-0.722; percentage of agreement 65%). Conclusions: Gastroenterologists performing a preprocedure assessment using Mallampati scores have poor agreement with anesthesiologists and colleagues and only moderate agreement with themselves.",0,0

Bronchoscopic material was examined from all patients, while sputum only from 352. Sputum was always analysed prior examination of bronchoscopic material cancer cells were found in material from lower airways in 366 patients (65%), correct cell typing was achieved in 286 (78.1%). Cancer cells were present in the sputum in 28.1% of the analysed patients and in 60% of the material obtained during bronchoscopy. In 178 patients with squamous cell lung cancer, cancer cells were found in 64.9% while correct cell typing was found in 83.4%. In 183 patients with small cell lung cancer, neoplastic cells were found in 72.6% of the cases while correct cell typing was achieved in 88.7%. In 144 patients with adenocarcinoma cancer cells were found in 53.4% while correct typing was present in 64.9%. In 18 cases of large cell lung cancer, cancer cells were present in 50%, and correct cell typing was achieved in 22.2%. Differences were statistically significant between small cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma. Correct cell typing was statistically more often significant in patients with squamous cell lung cancer or SCLC in comparison with the other types. Significant results of positive cytology was found when analysing localisation of the tumor. In cases of central tumor cytology was positive in 60% of the cases, while in peripheral tumors it was positive only in 43.9% of the cases.

12779357,Virtual bronchoscopy: comparison of different surface rendering models,"The aim of this study was to compare different representation models of surface-rendered virtual bronchoscopy. 10 consecutive patients with inoperable primary lung tumors underwent thin-section spiral computed tomography. The structures of interest, the tracheobronchial system and anatomical and pathological thoracic structures were segmented using an interactive threshold interval volume-growing segmentation algorithm and visualized with the aid of a color-coded surface rendering method. For virtual bronchoscopy, the tracheobronchial system was visualized using a triangle-surface rendering model, a shaded-surface rendering model and a transparent shaded-surface rendering model. The triangle-surface rendering model allowed optimum detailed spatial representation of the dimensions of extraluminal anatomical and pathological mediastinal structures. As the lumen of the tracheobronchial system was less well defined, the rendering model was of limited use for depiction of the airway surface. The shaded-surface rendering model facilitated an optimum assessment of the airway surface, but the mediastinal structures could not be depicted. The transparent shaded-surface rendering model provides simultaneous adequate to optimum visualization and assessment of the intraluminal airway surface and the extraluminal mediastinal structures as well as a quantitative assessment of the spatial relationship between these structures. Fast data acquisition with a multi-slice detector spiral computed tomography scanner and the use of virtual bronchoscopy with the transparent shaded-surface rendering model obviate the need for time consuming detailed analysis and presentation of axial source images by providing improved the diagnostic imaging of endotracheal and endobronchial diseases and offering a useful alternative to fiberoptic bronchoscopy.",0,0
23521105,A randomized comparison of the laryngeal mask airway supreme™ and laryngeal mask airway unique™ in infants and children: does cuff pressure influence leak pressure?,"Background: The cuff pressure for optimal airway sealing with first-generation laryngeal mask airway has been shown to be 40 cm H(2)O in children. Currently, there are no data regarding the ideal intracuff pressure for the laryngeal mask airway Supreme (Supreme) in children. Objectives: To compare the clinical performance of the laryngeal mask airway supreme with the laryngeal mask airway unique in infants and children. Materials and methods: One hundred eighty children were assigned to receive either a Supreme or a laryngeal mask airway-U. We hypothesized higher airway leak pressure with the Supreme at both 40 cm H(2)O and 60 cm H(2)O, when compared with the laryngeal mask airway-U. Ease and time of insertion, insertion attempts, fiber optic examination, quality of airway, efficacy of mechanical ventilation, success of gastric tube placement (Supreme), incidence of gastric insufflation, and complications were also assessed. Results: Airway leak pressure at an intracuff pressure of 60 cm H(2)O for the Supreme was 17.4 (5.2) vs laryngeal mask airway-U at 18.4 (6.6) cm H(2)O and did not differ when compared to an intracuff pressure of 40 cm H(2)O for both devices; Supreme at 17.2 (5) vs laryngeal mask airway-U at 17.7 (6) cm H(2)O. The laryngeal mask airway-U was associated with higher first-attempt success rates. The Supreme was associated with less gastric insufflation than the laryngeal mask airway-U. Conclusions: Intracuff pressures of 40 cm H(2)O may be sufficient for the Supreme in children, and there may be no added benefit of an intracuff pressure of 60 cm H(2)O, as leak pressures were similar. The Supreme may be preferred over the laryngeal mask airway-U for its lower rates of gastric insufflation and provision for gastric access when mechanical ventilation is utilized.",0,0
11437876,Fibreoptic views through the laryngeal mask and the intubating laryngeal mask,"Background and objective: The intubating laryngeal mask (intubating laryngeal mask airway) was designed to facilitate blind intubation. Its value as an adjunct to fibreoptic laryngoscopy has not been evaluated. This study compares the intubating laryngeal mask airway with the standard laryngeal mask airway as conduits for fibreoptic laryngoscopy. Methods: The fibreoptic view of the laryngeal inlet was graded via both devices in 60 anaesthetized patients. The fibreoptic view through the intubating laryngeal mask airway was assessed after the central epiglottic elevator bar had been lifted out of the field of vision by an 8-mm Euromedical tracheal tube, which was inserted to a depth of 18 cm. The fibreoptic view from the aperture bars of the laryngeal mask was recorded. Results: The vocal cords were viewed less frequently through the intubating laryngeal mask airway (52%) than through the laryngeal mask airway (92%) [difference = 40% (95% CI = 26% to 54%), P < 0.0001]. Conclusion: The view of the laryngeal inlet is better through the laryngeal mask airway than through a tracheal tube inserted to 18 cm in the intubating laryngeal mask.",0,0

24992127,Impact of bedside bronchoscopy in critically ill lung transplant recipients,"Background: Over 32,000 lung transplants have been performed worldwide for a variety of end-stage lung diseases (http://www.ishlt.org/). Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is frequently used as a bedside-tool for diagnosis and management of respiratory failure among critically ill lung transplant recipients (LTRs). We study the indications, results, therapeutic impact, and complications of FB in LTRs admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU). Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed for all critically ill LTRs undergoing FB while admitted to MICU at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 2009 and 2011. ICD-9 codes for bronchoscopy were used to identify patients. The procedures were categorized as: (i) airway examination and interventions, (ii) microbiological, and (iii) histopathologic diagnosis. SAS version 9.2 was used for analysis. Results: A cohort of 76 LTRs accounted for 93 hospital admissions, 101 MICU admissions, and 129 bronchoscopies. FB was helpful in evaluation and management of airway complications [secretion clearance (18% bronchoscopy procedures), stenosis/dehiscence (8% patients)] and optimizing management of lower respiratory tract infections. Isolation of resistant gram-negative organisms, community-acquired respiratory viruses, and fungi commonly led to modification in antimicrobial therapy (35% microbiological samples). Nonspecific finding of acute lung injury was the most commonly seen histopathology (70%) on transbronchial biopsy. Twenty percent (4/20) of transbronchial biopsies showed acute cellular rejection, with 1 episode contributing to respiratory failure. Occasional hypoxia and hypotension, but no deaths, were noted due to FB during the ICU admission.

25038573,Preferential removal and immobilization of stable and radioactive cesium in contaminated fly ash with nanometallic Ca/CaO methanol suspension,"In this work, the capability of nanometallic Ca/CaO methanol suspension in removing and/or immobilizing stable ((133)Cs) and radioactive cesium species ((134)Cs and (137)Cs) in contaminated fly ash was investigated. After a first methanol and second water washing yielded only 45% of (133)Cs removal. While, after a first methanol washing, the second solvent with nanometallic Ca/CaO methanol suspension yielded simultaneous enhanced removal and immobilization about 99% of (133)Cs. SEM-EDS analysis revealed that the mass percent of detectable (133)Cs on the fly ash surface recorded a 100% decrease. When real radioactive cesium contaminated fly ash (containing an initial 14,040Bqkg(-1)(134)Cs and (137)Cs cumulated concentration) obtained from burning wastes from Fukushima were reduced to 3583Bqkg(-1) after treatment with nanometallic Ca/CaO methanol suspension. Elution test conducted on the treated fly ash gave 100BqL(-1) total (134)Cs and (137)Cs concentrations in eluted solution. Furthermore, both ash content and eluted solution concentrations of (134)Cs and (137)Cs were much lower than the Japanese Ministry of the Environment regulatory limit of 8000Bqkg(-1) and 150BqL(-1) respectively. The results of this study suggest that the nanometallic Ca/CaO methanol suspension is a highly potential amendment for the remediation of radioactive cesium-contaminated fly ash.",0,0
27066415,Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Role of an Otorhinolaryngologist,"Obstructive sleep apnea is a disorder resulting from collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Its etiology is multifactorial, resulting from the interdependence of structurally vulnerable upper airway anatomy interacting with physiologic mechanism of ventilator instability during sleep. The ENT causes for OSA are relatively simple conditions that can be treated by safe and simple medical and/or surgical procedures. To assess the prevalence of ENT disorders in patients presenting to the sleep clinic. Patients presented to sleep clinic were submitted to an assessment protocol including clinical history, otorhinolaryngology examination and a polysomnography. Total 69 patients were included and distributed into two groups according to AHI: patients with sleep disordered breathing only (simple snorer and/or AHI ≤ 5) and patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (AHI > 5). There was significant statistical difference for deviated nasal septum (p = 0.0004) and inferior turbinate hypertrophy (p = 0.03) in both groups. Most patients were in the class III and IV of Mallampati classification. Odds of having OSA increases more than 1.5 folds as the level of Mallampati classification increases by one class. ENT disorders were more common in the patients with OSA than in simple snorers and have impact on pathophysiology of OSA and its treatment modality. Hence, ENT examination in all patients with sleep disordered breathing will be helpful.",0,0
25437694,[Comparison of different tests to determine difficult intubation in pediatric patients],"Background: The difficulties with airway management is the main reason for pediatric anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Objective: To assess the value of modified Mallampati test, Upper-Lip-Bite test, thyromental distance and the ratio of height to thyromental distance to predict difficult intubation in pediatric patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Measurements and results: Data were collected from 5 to 11 years old 250 pediatric patients requiring tracheal intubation. The Cormack and Lehane classification was used to evaluate difficult laryngoscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and AUC values for each test were measured. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of modified Mallampati test were 76.92% and 95.54%, while those for ULBT were 69.23% and 97.32%. The optimal cutoff point for the ratio of height to thyromental distance and thyromental distance for predicting difficult laryngoscopy was 23.5 (sensitivity, 57.69%; specificity, 86.61%) and 5.5cm (sensitivity, 61.54%; specificity, 99.11%). The modified Mallampati was the most sensitive of the tests. The ratio of height to thyromental distance was the least sensitive test. Conclusion: These results suggested that the modified Mallampati and Upper-Lip-Bite tests may be useful in pediatric patients for predicting difficult intubation.",0,0
11782336,Effective nasotracheal intubation using a modified transillumination technique,"Purpose: Difficult intubation is a major problem in anesthesia. In case of limited mouth opening only a few intubating devices are available. Our study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a modified transillumination technique for nasotracheal intubation (NTI). Methods: One hundred twenty-three patients needing NTI were studied, 76 in group A: NTI with no expected intubation difficulty; and 47 in group B: limited mouth opening (<20 mm). All intubations were performed with the Trachlight(TM). Patients in group A were under general anesthesia while deep sedation (maintaining spontaneous breathing) was used in patients in group B. The standard transillumination technique was modified by keeping the metallic stylet in place and personalizing the length and the angle of the short arm of the J shaped endotracheal tube-transillumination lightwand (ETT-TL) assembly. Results: The overall rate of success was 98.4% and 92.6% of intubations were successful on the first attempt. The average duration of intubation was 28 sec +/- 15 sec. Success rate and duration of intubation were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Modification of the technique facilitated transillumination and placement of the ETT. The simplicity and high success rate of NTI by transillumination with the TL suggest our modified technique is a valuable alternative for NTI in patients with difficult airway.",0,0
1590579,[A difficult intubation in a case of endolaryngeal paraganglioma],"In a female patient aged 71, a tumor of unknown histology almost completely occupied the whole of the supraglottic space. Because of the valve-like behaviour of the tumor, the patient could not be ventilated by mask. Therefore, preoxygenation and preservation of spontaneous breathing were essential. Anaesthesia was induced by titration of etomidate, and no muscle relaxant or opioid was administered. The patient was successfully intubated by means of direct laryngoscopy. In all probability the blind nasal technique or the use of a fiberoptic device would not have been helpful, because the tumor had to be luxated before the endotracheal tube could be placed. Figure 1 shows the tumor (a) with a diameter of approximately 3 cm, which has displaced the epiglottis (b) to the left. A part of the endotracheal tube is visible at the bottom left. The spiral tube had to be replaced by a tube suitable for laser surgery. After resection (see Fig. 2) the coagulated tumor base (a) and the right vocal cord (b) can be seen with the laser tube still in place. Postoperatively extubation was possible. The histological examination revealed a paraganglioma without signs of malignancy. Apart from occlusion of the upper airway, the main danger stems from the considerable vascularization of such a paraganglioma. Not only the surgical procedure, but also minor manipulations during the endotracheal intubation may cause significant blood loss. In a small percentage of cases hormone-mediated cardiocirculatory complications may occur. If a difficult intubation is expected because of an endolaryngeal tumor, management should be based on the diagnostic findings and the planned surgical procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
7640115,Increase in Mallampati score during pregnancy,"A photographic version of the Mallampati test was developed and applied to 242 pregnant patients at 12 weeks' gestation and again at 38 weeks' gestation. At 38 weeks the number of grade 4 cases had increased by 34% (P < 0.001). This is in agreement with other evidence which suggests that difficult laryngoscopy is slightly more frequent in obstetrics (1.7%) than in general surgery (1.3%). The increase in Mallampati score correlated with gain in body weight (r = 0.3, P < 0.001), which gives some support to the concept that fluid retention is the underlying cause. We conclude that pharyngeal oedema causes some hindrance to tracheal intubation in obstetrics, but not enough to explain the high failure rate reported. A case is made for rationalizing the management of difficult intubation. Our data also show that more research is needed on factors which affect Mallampati's test, particularly neck extension.",0,0
22451658,Overexpression of hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1/p32/gC1qR) in HepG2 cells leads to increased hyaluronan synthesis and cell proliferation by up-regulation of cyclin D1 in AKT-dependent pathway,"Overexpression of the mature form of hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1/gC1qR/p32), a ubiquitous multifunctional protein involved in cellular signaling, in normal murine fibroblast cells leads to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately apoptosis with the release of cytochrome c. In the present study, human liver cancer cell line HepG2, having high intracellular antioxidant levels was chosen for stable overexpression of HABP1. The stable transformant of HepG2, overexpressing HABP1 does not lead to ROS generation, cellular stress, and apoptosis, rather it induced enhanced cell growth and proliferation over longer periods. Phenotypic changes in the stable transformant were associated with the increased ""HA pool,"" formation of the ""HA cable"" structure, up-regulation of HA synthase-2, and CD44, a receptor for HA. Enhanced cell survival was further supported by activation of MAP kinase and AKT-mediated cell survival pathways, which leads to an increase in CYCLIN D1 promoter activity. Compared with its parent counterpart HepG2, the stable transformant showed enhanced tumorigenicity as evident by its sustained growth in low serum conditions, formation of the HA cable structure, increased anchorage-independent growth, and cell-cell adhesion. This study suggests that overexpression of HABP1 in HepG2 cells leads to enhanced cell survival and tumorigenicity by activating HA-mediated cell survival pathways.",0,0
19152832,Dermal microdialysis of inflammatory markers induced by aliphatic hydrocarbons in rats,"In the present study we made an attempt to understand the skin irritation cascade of selected aliphatic hydrocarbons using microdialysis technique. Microdialysis probes were inserted into dermis in the dorsal skin of hairless rats. After 2h of probes insertion, occlusive dermal exposure (2h) was carried out with 230 microl of nonane, dodecane and tetradecane, using Hill top chambers((R)). Inflammatory biomarkers such as substance P (SP), alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) were analyzed in the dialysis samples by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). SP, alpha-MSH and IL6 were released in significant amounts following the dermal exposure of nonane and dodecane, whereas tetradecane did not induce any of these markers in significant amounts compared to control. Nonane increased the PGE(2) levels in significant amounts within 2h of chemical exposure compared to dodecane and tetradecane. IL-6 response was found to be slow and 2-3-fold increase in IL-6 levels was observed after 5h following nonane and dodecane application. The magnitude of skin irritation exerted by all three chemicals was in the order of nonane>or=dodecane>or=tetradecane. The results demonstrate that microdialysis can be used to measure the inflammatory biomarkers in the skin irritation studies and irritation response of chemicals was quantifiable by this method. In conclusion, microdialysis was found to be an excellent tool to measure several inflammatory biomarkers as a function of time after dermal exposures with irritant chemicals.",0,0
22678331,Percutaneous pancreatic necrosectomy: a case of difficult pancreatic intubation,A significant percentage of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis will develop an infected pancreatic necrosis that contributes to the morbidity and mortality. Infected pancreatic necrosis requires drainage and debridement. This can be performed percutaneously or surgically. Surgical management may be performed with open or minimally invasive techniques. There has been a trend toward minimally invasive surgical management in recent years. Minimally invasive management requires effective drainage through the use of large-bore drain catheters. We describe a technique that facilitates the insertion of large-bore drainage tubes within the pancreatic collections.,0,0
19860245,[BONFILS retromolar intubation fiberscope VS styletscope for oro-tracheal intubation],"Background: Battery-powered BONFILS Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope (B-scope) is a nonflexible fiberscope having the same curvature as the Macintosh laryngoscope. Battery-powered StyletScope (S-scope) has a flexible apex whose direction was controlled by grasping a handle. We assessed the operational performance of the two scopes. Methods: Fifty patients were randomly allocated in the two groups :25 patients were in the B group (B-scope) and 25 were S group (S-scope) after obtaining written informed consent. We evaluated Mallampati class classification, size of tracheal tube, and intubation time. Results: There are no significance differences between the two groups in Mallampati class, demographic date and intubation time (23 +/-15 sec in B-group and 26 +/-14 sec in S-group). Both scopes were good in operational performance. Conclusions: BONFILS Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope and StyletScope are both good in the operational performance.",0,0
2193777,Intensive management of severe head injury,"Intensive management of patients with severe head injury offers the best hope of minimizing death and functional disability in a young, working population. Secondary neurologic insult can be decreased by cardiorespiratory support and ICP control from the outset. Rapid neurologic assessment, airway management, and support of circulation are the basis of emergency management for head injury. Patients with severe head injury require intensive care management for two major reasons: management of ICP and management of organ system dysfunction. Care should not be withheld because of initially grim (and inaccurate) prognostic assessment. Newer techniques for assessing the adequacy of cerebral circulation may allow refinement of management strategies in the future.",0,0
20107968,Role of ultrathin transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy: experience with 50 patients,"Conventional gastroscopes have a diameter of 8.8-12 mm; ultrathin endoscopes have an outer diameter of 5.3-5.9 mm. We share our experience with 50 patients who underwent transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy using an ultrathin endoscope. The indications included endoscopyassisted nasogastric tube placement in 25 patients, tight lesions not negotiable with conventional endoscope in 9, restricted mouth opening in 9, corrosive injury in 3, restricted cervical spine movement in 2 and altered sensorium following cerebrovascular accident in 2 patients. Transnasal esophageal intubation failed in 1 patient each with oropharyngeal malignancy and lipoma annularis coli. Wire-guided naso-jejunal tube placement was done in 2 patients and transnasal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was done in 1 patient. Two patients developed self-limiting epistaxis. Ultrathin transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscope is a useful tool in endoscopy units, particularly those dealing with oncology patients. Inability to deliver endotherapy due to small diameter of the working channel is a limitation.",0,0
18556868,Awake intubation with Airtraq laryngoscope in a morbidly obese patient,"The Airtraq laryngoscope (AL) is a new disposable tracheal intubation device. The authors reported the case of a successful awake intubation with AL of the trachea in a morbidly obese patient. A 54-year-old female, morbidly obese (BMI 38 kg/m), patient was scheduled for a tumor removal of the right eye under general anesthesia. She had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. The preoperative airway assessment showed difficult ventilation and intubation. An awake intubation under sedation and topical airway anesthesia were chosen. The first attempt of tracheal intubation with AL was unsuccessful because the tip of endotracheal tube (ET-tube) pointed to the arytenoid cartilage. The second attempt, with slight rotation of AL, glottic view showed grade I and the ET-tube passed through the vocal cords easily The authors 'experiences demonstrated that the AL could be used while awake and may be an alternative laryngoscope for airway management in morbidly obese patients.",0,0
20097502,A new maneuver for endotracheal tube insertion during difficult GlideScope intubation,"Background: The GlideScope Video Laryngoscope (Verathon, Bothell, WA) is a video laryngoscopy system that can be used for routine intubation, but is also commonly used as an alternative for difficult or failed airways. Previous reports have identified a very high incidence of grade 1 and grade 2 Cormack-Lehane glottic views, but despite these high-grade views, intubation is sometimes difficult due to the angle of insertion and shape of the endotracheal tube. Several maneuvers have been reported to increase the likelihood of successful endotracheal tube placement in these uncommon cases of failure. Case report: We report the case of a patient who could not be intubated with the GlideScope despite an easily obtained grade 1 laryngoscopic view. The impediment to intubation was identified as a sharp angulation of the trachea with respect to the larynx, such that the trachea formed a steep posterior angle with the laryngeal/glottic axis. Intubation was achieved using a previously unreported maneuver, in which the endotracheal tube with a sharply curved malleable stylet was inserted through the glottis, and then rotated 180 degrees to permit passage down the trachea. Discussion and conclusion: We believe that this maneuver may be useful in other cases of failed GlideScope intubation, when a high-grade laryngeal view is obtained but tube passage is not possible due to a sharp posterior angulation of the trachea.",0,0
10410410,Children with mucopolysaccharidoses--three cases report,"The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited disorders of metabolism, with widespread, progressive involvement and derangement of many organs and tissues. Because of their disabling nature, frequent surgical intervention for the abnormality entailed is common, and is associated with a high degree of anesthetic risks perioperatively. One of the major hazards which we find clinically is airway difficulty. Multiple factors are present in the mucopolysaccharidoses to make airway management and trachael intubation potentially hazardous. Aside from generalized infiltration and thickening of the soft tissues, the oropharynx may be obstructed by a large tongue with tonsillar hypertrophy. Also, the friable mucosa covering the nasal and oral pharynx renders these structures easily to bleed and edematous. The neck is typically short and immobile, and the cervical spine and tempromandibular joint may have a limited range of movement. From our experience, we have learned not to overlook the propensity of airway difficulty. The uniqueness of their anatomy and extremely sensitive airway often result in failed intubation and bronchospasm even after successful intubation. Recently, in Mackay Memorial Hospital we have encountered in series three pediatric cases with mucopolysaccharidoses (one Hurler and two Hunter syndromes). In this report we would like to share our experiences and to discuss the anesthetic risks and management of the MPS patients.",0,0
10807361,Benefit of feeding assessment before pediatric airway reconstruction,"Objectives/hypothesis: To determine the utility of preoperative feeding assessments in children undergoing airway reconstruction, identifying parameters that correlate with functional deficits in swallowing and postoperative feeding difficulties. Study design: Prospective, sequential enrollment. Methods: Two hundred fifty-five patients with structural abnormalities of the upper aerodigestive tract underwent endoscopic swallow studies. Classification of preoperative feeding abilities, specific feeding disorders, and abnormal endoscopic feeding parameters were used to predict the postoperative course of patients undergoing airway reconstruction. The relationships between diagnoses and functional feeding categories and postoperative outcomes and functional feeding categories were appraised by chi2 analysis. Results: The median age of the study population was 2.5 years. Fifty-three percent of the patients were tracheotomy dependent. Only 13% of the patients had diagnoses limited to the airway, with 45% of patients having three or more diagnoses. Worse preoperative feeding abilities were associated with the presence of a tracheotomy, age 2 years or less, and multiple underlying diagnoses. Neurological diagnoses were associated with worse feeding abilities. Preoperative feeding assessments directly altered the course of management of 15% of operative patients, by recommending a delay in the surgical correction, the placement of a gastrostomy tube preoperatively, or a modification in the surgical reconstruction planned for the patient. Postoperative airway protection predictions were 80% accurate. Twelve percent of the predictions involved patients who developed unforeseen complications that required additional treatments or prolonged the hospital stay secondary to difficulties with airway protection. There was no correlation between the preoperative feeding abilities of the patients and their postoperative course after airway reconstruction. Conclusion: Transient dysphagia is common after laryngotracheal reconstruction. Preoperative feeding abilities do not correlate with the postoperative airway protection abilities of a patient. Feeding assessments before pediatric airway reconstruction provide a means of identifying patients with poor airway protection mechanisms that may compromise the patient after reconstruction. Findings on swallowing evaluations that predict poor airway protective mechanisms are 1) pooling of secretions in the hypopharynx, 2) poor oral motor skills, allowing premature spillage of material into the hypopharynx where it penetrates the larynx, and 3) residue that persists in the hypopharynx after multiple swallows. The integration of information generated from the preoperative swallowing assessment promotes the selection of operative procedures that are optimal for that patient and highlights specific therapy issues that may need to be addressed in the postoperative management of the patient that may not have been obvious without the study.",0,0
6497242,Flexible neonatalscope,"Since the introduction of small flexible fiberoptic scopes for the examination of airways, efforts have been made to reduce their size to fit the smallest patients. The first practical scope of this type was the 3.9-mm nasopharyngolaryngoscope introduced in 1975. Modifications over the years have led to the development of the 1.7-mm neonatalscope, primarily designed for the examination of intubated neonates. This neonatalscope has been of great help in determining placement of endotracheal and tracheotomy tubes, as well as in localizing areas of obstruction within the tubes. By means of a special adapter the scope may be used while the patient is on a respirator. Introduction of this new generation of flexible scopes will undoubtedly lead to other valuable and interesting applications of this instrument.",0,0

In the case of esophageal impaction, the likelihood and severity of complications are proportionate to the time between ingestion and removal. Tracheo-esophageal fistulae (TOF) are a recognized complication and can be life-threatening. We describe an interesting case of disc battery ingestion with delayed recognition of a TOF.

7739097,[Comparison of intubating condition under sevoflurane and halothane anesthesia in pediatric patients],"We compared intubating conditions under sevoflurane (group S) and halothane (group H) anesthesia in pediatric patients for otorhinolaryngological surgery. One hundred and six patients were divided randomly into group S (n = 60) and group H (n = 46). Anesthesia was induced with nitrous oxide-oxygen-sevoflurane (GOS, end-tidal sevoflurane concentration; 4.5%) or nitrous oxide-oxygen-halothane (GOF, end-tidal halothane concentration; 1.6%). Intubating conditions were assessed according to the intubation score, which consists of the following three factors; mouth opening, visibility of vocal cord and body movement. Each factor is divided into three grades (0, 1, 2); total scores of 0 correspond to excellent. In comparing the groups with respect to anesthetic induction, group S required 180 sec for disappearance of spontaneous breathing and 660 sec for completion of intubation, while, in group H, the above time intervals were 188 and 676 sec, respectively. We achieved significantly better intubating conditions in group H than group S. There were significantly more cases in group S than in group H in which vocal cord visibility was insufficient. Body movement during intubation was observed in 27% and 26% of patients in group S and H, respectively. In conclusion, halothane anesthesia provides better intubating conditions than sevoflurane anesthesia in slow induction for pediatric patients.",0,0
23466424,Predictors and outcome of early-onset pneumonia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"Background: Early-onset pneumonia (EOP) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is frequently observed. Causative factors are loss of airway protection during cardiac arrest, pulmonary contusion, and emergency airway management. We assessed the incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of EOP, and evaluated the impact of an early exchange of the prehospitally inserted endotracheal tube (ETT). Methods: In our retrospective analysis we included 104 consecutive subjects admitted to our ICU after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between 2007 and 2012. All subjects underwent therapeutic hypothermia. We analyzed clinical course, inflammation indicators, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score, occurrence of EOP, duration of ventilatory support, microbiological findings, and short-term outcome. Results: Of the 104 subjects, 46.2% received an exchange of ETT directly after hospital admission. Neither ETT exchange nor observed aspiration were associated with elevated CPIS or EOP, nor with proof of microorganisms in respiratory secretions. We found no differences in duration of ventilatory support, P(aO2)/F(IO2), ICU days, or outcome. C-reactive protein was significantly higher in subjects with aspiration (P = .046). Sex, age, smoking status, aspiration, cause of cardiac arrest, first detected heart rhythm, and use of supraglottic airways devices were not associated with EOP. Subjects with EOP had a longer need for ventilatory support (P = .005), higher tracheotomy rate (P = .03), longer ICU stay (P = .005), higher C-reactive protein (P < .001), higher body temperature (P = .003), higher Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (P < .001), and lower P(aO2)/F(IO2) (P = .008). Conclusions: The rate of EOP was not significantly influenced by the exchange of the preclinically inserted ETT, but was associated with longer need for mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.",0,0

16297466,Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR/SXR) resides predominantly in the nuclear compartment of the interphase cell and associates with the condensed chromosomes during mitosis,"Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR) is a transcription factor that is activated by a diverse range of xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites including steroids, bile acids and about 50% of the prescription drugs. In specific cell types (e.g. liver and intestine) it serves as a 'xenosensor' by regulating expression of a network of genes involved in xenobiotic clearance from the body. PXR expression in several cancerous tissues and its regulated expression of multi-drug resistance proteins highlight its significance in prognosis of malignancies. The view that subcellular localization and ligand induced movements of transcription factors is one of the major phenomena in regulating transcriptional activity, we used a green fluorescent protein tagged PXR chimera to study its dynamic behaviour in living cells. Under all experimental conditions, PXR was observed to be a predominantly nuclear protein maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the interphase cells. Interestingly, for the first time, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PXR, has been observed to be associated with condensed chromosomes during all the mitotic stages of cell division. The significance of PXR association with mitotic chromosomes is discussed.",0,0
20037149,Awake light-aided blind nasal intubation: prototype device,"Background: Limited mouth opening associated with unavailable or ineffective fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) is an intubation challenge. A light-aiding device may facilitate the blind nasal intubation. Methods: Awake blind nasal intubation was planned for 16 elective patients with inaccessible oral route (three children and 13 adults, ASA I-II). Topical anaesthesia for the supraglottis, glottis, and upper trachea was performed using prototype supraglottic topical anaesthesia device and cricothyroid injection of local anaesthesia. Hand-made light-aiding intubation device was used to help blind nasal intubation. Three attempts of blind nasal intubation (60 s each) were allowed, otherwise failure and FOB intubation were considered. During the procedure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and arterial oxygen saturation (Spa(o(2))) were measured. Temperature created at the bulb surface of the device was measured for 4 min duration, with and without exposing the bulb to oxygen flow of 6 litre min(-1). Results: All the patients were successfully intubated except one child. Time to intubate in adults was mean (sd) 52.7 (8.6) s. Spa(o(2)) showed significant difference between before and after procedural values. The maximum temperature recorded at the bulb surface was 46.8 (0.4) degrees C and 48.1 (0.8) degrees C with and without oxygen flow, respectively. Conclusions: The device appeared to be a safe and cost-effective transillumination method for blind nasal intubation in difficult airways.",0,0
12695842,Follow-up after stent insertion in the tracheobronchial tree: role of helical computed tomography in comparison with fiberoptic bronchoscopy,"The aim of this study was to compare helical CT with fiberoptic bronchoscopy findings to appraise the medium-term results of proximal-airways stenting. Twenty-five patients with 28 endobronchial metallic stents inserted for local advanced malignancy ( n=13) or benign diseases ( n=12) underwent follow-up CT from 3 days to 50 months (mean 8 months). All studies were obtained using helical CT with subsequent multiplanar reformation and three-dimensional reconstruction including virtual bronchoscopy. The location, shape, and patency of stents and adjacent airway were assessed. The results of CT were compared with the results of fiberoptic bronchoscopy obtained with a mean delay of 2.5 days (SD 9 days) after CT scan. Twelve stents (43%) remained in their original position, patent and without deformity. Sixteen stents were associated with local complications: migration ( n=6); external compression with persistent stenosis ( n=4); local recurrence of malignancy ( n=4); fracture ( n=1); and non-congruence between the airway and the stent ( n=1). The CT demonstrated all the significant abnormalities demonstrated at fiberoptic bronchoscopy except two moderate stenoses (20%) related to granulomata at the origin of the stent. Ten of 14 stents inserted for benign conditions were without complications as compared with 2 of 14 in malignant conditions ( p=0.008). Computed tomography is an accurate noninvasive method for evaluating endobronchial stents. The CT is a useful technique for follow-up of patients who have undergone endobronchial stenting.",0,0
11399687,Extensive sampling improves preoperative bronchoscopic assessment of airway invasion by supracarinal esophageal cancer: a prospective study in 166 patients,"Background: The utility of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the preoperative assessment of patients with esophageal cancer has not been thoroughly investigated. More accurate staging could improve the design of clinical trials and avoid inappropriate surgical decisions in individual patients. Study objective: To evaluate the utility of bronchoscopy in the preoperative assessment of airway invasion by supracarinal esophageal cancer. Design: We prospectively analyzed 220 bronchoscopies in 166 consecutive patients with supracarinal esophageal cancer and correlated the findings with operative results and survival. Results: In 126 bronchoscopies (57.3%), no abnormal findings could be seen in the airways. Compared with histologic and cytologic results, the normal macroscopic appearance of the airways had a negative predictive value of 94.4%, but the positive predictive value of all macroscopic abnormalities for the diagnosis of airway invasion was low, particularly after radiation therapy. Endoluminal tumor mass, protrusion of the posterior tracheal wall, and signs of mucosal invasion were visible in 5.9%, 28.6%, and 4.1% of the bronchoscopies, respectively. However, in only 8.6% of the 220 bronchoscopies, cancer invasion was proved by biopsy or cytology. Bronchoscopy with biopsies and brush and washing cytology examinations was the sole decisive staging procedure, enabling the exclusion from surgery because of airway invasion in 18.1% of otherwise potentially operable patients, with an overall accuracy of 93.3% (95% confidence interval, 86.7 to 97.3%). The results of bronchoscopy were falsely negative in six patients, who all underwent surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. Conclusions: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with systematic multiple biopsies and brush and washing cytology examinations is an accurate procedure in evaluating the possible invasion of supracarinal esophageal cancer into the airways. Macroscopic findings alone are not reliable; errors in sole bronchoscopic inspection would have resulted in operations that would be unlikely to help the patients or would have inappropriately excluded patients from surgery.",0,0
22881293,"The effect of a cervical collar on the seal pressure of the LMA Supreme™: a prospective, crossover trial","For personnel inexperienced in airway management, supraglottic airway devices may be the first choice in an emergency. Changing head position is known to reduce the seal pressure of a laryngeal mask airway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of a cervical collar improves the stability of airways secured with the LMA Supreme™ (The Laryngeal Mask Company Limited, Mahé, Seychelles). In this crossover trial, the primary endpoint was the difference in the seal pressure of the LMA Supreme in anaesthetised patients in maximum passive extension of the neck, with and without a cervical collar. The median (IQR [range]) seal pressure was 18 (13.8-22.1 [0-30]) cmH(2) O in maximum passive extension without a cervical collar. With a cervical collar in place, the seal pressure increased to 28 (22.8-30 [17-30]) cmH(2) O (p<0.001). In the neutral head position, the seal pressure was 22 (17.6-24.5 [12-30]) cmH(2) O without and 27 (22-30 [12-30]) cmH(2) O with a cervical collar in place (p<0.001). We found that a cervical collar stabilises the airway with an LMA Supreme in place and we recommend this combination for (pre-hospital) emergency cases.",0,0
8417743,Ear-nose-throat abnormalities in the CHARGE association,"A comprehensive evaluation of the otolaryngological abnormalities in 50 patients with colobomata, heart defect, atresia of the choanae, retarded growth or development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies or deafness (CHARGE) was performed. All the patients had ear abnormalities; 96% (48/50) had malformed pinnae, and 54% (27/50) had facial nerve palsies. Only 8% (4/50) had normal hearing, the commonest hearing defect being severe conductive or mixed loss. Eighty-four percent (42/50) of computed tomographic scans of the temporal bone were abnormal, the characteristic abnormality being the combination of a hypoplastic incus and absent semicircular canals. Eighty-six percent (43/50) of patients had upper airway abnormalities. Posterior choanal abnormalities occurred in 56% (28/50), and 42% (21/50) had retrognathia leading to intubation difficulties. Laryngotracheal abnormalities occurred in 38% (19/50), and 14% (7/50) required tracheostomies. Careful upper airway assessment is essential to avoid potentially lethal complications such as aspiration.",0,0
20412457,A comparison of bonfils fiberscope-assisted laryngoscopy and standard direct laryngoscopy in simulated difficult pediatric intubation: a manikin study,"Introduction: Difficult airway management in children is challenging. One alternative device to the gold standard of direct laryngoscopy is the STORZ Bonfils fiberscope (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany), a rigid fiberoptic stylette-like scope with a curved tip. Although results in adults have been encouraging, reports regarding its use in children have been conflicting. We compared the effectiveness of a standard laryngoscope to the Bonfils fiberscope in a simulated difficult infant airway. Methods: Ten pediatric anesthesiologists were recruited for this study and asked to perform three sets of tasks. For the first task, each participant intubated an unaltered manikin (SimBaby (TM), Laerdal, Puchheim, Germany) five times using a styletted 3.5 endotracheal tube (ETT) and a Miller 1 blade (group DL-Normal). For the second task, a difficult airway configuration simulating a Cormack-Lehane grade 3B view was created by fixing a Miller-1 blade into position in the manikin using a laboratory stand. Each participant then intubated the manikin five times with a styletted 3.5 ETT using conventional technique but without touching the laryngoscope (group DL-Difficult). In the third task, the manikin was kept in the same difficult airway configuration, and each participant intubated the manikin five times using a 3.5-mm ETT mounted on the Bonfils fiberscope as an adjunct to direct laryngoscopy with the Miller-1 blade (group BF-Difficult). Primary outcomes were time to intubate and success rate. Results: A total of 150 intubations were performed. Correct ETT placement was achieved in 100% of attempts in group DL-Normal, 90% of attempts in group DL-Difficult and 98% of attempts in BF-Difficult. Time to intubate averaged 14 s (interquartile range 12-16) in group DL-Normal; 12 s (10-15) in group DL-Difficult; and 11 s (10-18) in group BF-Difficult. The percentage of glottic opening seen (POGO score) was 70% (70-80) in group DL-Normal; 0% (0-0) in group DL-Difficult; and 100% (100-100) in group BF-Difficult. Discussion: The Bonfils fiberscope-assisted laryngoscopy was easier to use and provided a better view of the larynx than simple direct laryngoscopy in the simulated difficult pediatric airway, but intubation success rate and time to intubate were not improved. Further studies of the Bonfils fibrescope as a pediatric airway adjunct are needed.",0,0
12519142,Niemann-Pick disease: a rare problem in anaesthesiological practice,We describe the problems encountered during general anaesthesia in a 2-year-old boy who was suffering from an extremely severe form of Niemann-Pick disease.

11973217,Should we reevaluate the variables for predicting the difficult airway in anesthesiology?,"Anesthesiologists have often been confronted with the difficult question of determining which patient will present an increased difficulty for endotracheal intubation. The limits of the previously reported morphometric airway measurements for predicting difficult intubation have inadequately addressed the normal patient population variables. We designed this prospective study to investigate the age and sex-related changes in the morphometric measurements of the airway in a large group of patients without anatomic abnormality and a group of cadavers. Hyomental, thyromental, sternomental distances, neck extension, and Mallampati scores were evaluated in 12 cadavers and in 334 patients. Patients were allocated to three groups based on age: Group 1 (20-30 yr), Group 2 (31-49 yr), and Group 3 (50-70 yr). Male and female sex differences were also evaluated. Hyomental distance was the only variable not affected by age. In addition, the mean population values were less than the threshold values suggested as criteria for difficult endotracheal intubation. All the other criteria were age-dependent and inversely affected by the increase in age. Male sex was also a distinction for increased measurements of all the morphometric distances. The mean degree of neck extension was similar in both sex groups. This study provides a more comprehensible approach to the morphometric measurements of the human airway. Adequate data of normal values may help the clinician to identify patients that are outside the range and therefore may be challenging. Implications: This study was performed to establish data on the average values of airway morphology in the adult population of different age groups and sex. Hyomental, thyromental, sternomental distances and neck extension values were measured on 12 cadavers and 334 patients.",0,0
12911356,Use of the bougie in simulated difficult intubation. 2. Comparison of single-use bougie with multiple-use bougie,"We studied the success rates for tracheal intubation in 32 healthy, anaesthetised patients during simulated grade IIIa laryngoscopy, randomised to either the multiple-use or the single-use bougie. Success rates (primary end-point) and times taken (secondary end-point) to achieve tracheal intubation were recorded. The multiple-use bougie was more successful than the single-use one (15/16 successful intubations vs. 9/16; p = 0.03). With either device, median [range] total tracheal intubation times for successful attempts were < 54 [24-84] s and there were no clinically important differences between these times. We conclude that the multiple-use bougie is a more reliable aid to tracheal intubation than the single-use introducer in grade IIIa laryngoscopy.",0,0
24786772,Integrated genetic approaches identify the molecular mechanisms of Sox4 in early B-cell development: intricate roles for RAG1/2 and CK1ε,"Commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to B lineage precursors and subsequent development of B lineage precursors into mature B cells is stringently controlled by stage-specific transcription factors. In this study, we used integrated genetic approaches and systematically determined the role of Sry-related high mobility group box (Sox) 4 and the underlying molecular mechanisms in early B-cell development. We found that Sox4 coordinates multilevel controls in the differentiation of early stage B cells. At the molecular level, Sox4 orchestrates a unique gene regulatory program, and its function was predominantly mediated through a conventional Sox4-binding motif as well as an unconventional GA-binding protein α chain binding motif. Our integrated gene network and functional analysis indicated that Sox4 functions as a bimodular transcription factor and ensures B lineage precursor differentiation through 2 distinct mechanisms. It positively induces gene rearrangements at immunoglobulin heavy chain gene loci by transcriptionally activating the Rag1 and Rag2 genes and negatively regulates Wnt signaling, which is critical for self-renewal, by inducing the expression of casein kinase 1 ε. Our findings illustrate that Sox4 mediates critical fine-tuning of the 2 opposing forces in early B-cell development and also set forth a model for characterization of critical genes whose deficiency, like Sox4 deficiency, is detrimental to this process.",0,0
21808400,Perioperative management of patients for osteo-odonto-kreatoprosthesis under general anaesthesia: A retrospective study,"An osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (OOKP) procedure is indicated in patients with failed corneal transplant but having intact retina for visual improvement. We studied perioperative concerns of patients who underwent the staged OOKP procedure. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent OOKP. The information regarding symptoms, associated comorbidities, perioperative events including anaesthetic management were collected. Eight patients (five females and three males) underwent the staged OOKP procedure. The median age was 18 years. The median weight was 45 kg. The median duration of loss of vision was 4 years. The aetiology of blindness included Stevens-Johnson's syndrome (SJS) (7) and chemical burn (1). Four patients had generalized skin problem due to SJS. All cases were managed under general anaesthesia, and airway management included nasotracheal intubation for stage I and orotracheal intubation for stage II. The median mallampati classification was I prior to OOKP stage I procedure while it changed to II at stage II procedure. Two patients required fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation. One patient had excessive oozing from the mucosal harvest site and was managed conservatively. In one patient, tooth harvesting was done twice as the first tooth was damaged during creating a hole in it. We conclude that OOKP requires multidisciplinary care. Anaesthesiologist should evaluate the airway carefully and disease-associated systemic involvements. The use of various drugs requires caution and steroid supplementation should be done. Airway difficulty should be anticipated, mandating thorough evaluation. Re-evaluation of airway is prudent as it may become difficult during the staged OOKP procedure.",0,0
15944969,Hemodynamics and oxygen saturation during intravenous sedation for office-based laser-assisted uvuloplasty,"Purpose: Patients undergoing office-based laser-assisted uvuloplasty (LAUP) for snoring or mild obstructive sleep apnea are generally obese and have a high Mallampati score. Because avoidance of supplemental oxygen during laser procedures is generally mandated, the potential for intraoperative desaturation is high. This study was designed to look at intraoperative hemodynamic changes, respiration patterns, and oxygen saturations during intravenous sedation with midazolam and fentanyl during LAUP procedures. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective anesthesia chart review of 15 consecutive patients undergoing midazolam/fentanyl intravenous sedation for office-based LAUP treatment for snoring and/or mild obstructive sleep apnea. Data recorded were noninvasive baseline and intraoperative hemodynamic measurements at 5-minute intervals for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), pulse (P), and rate-pressure product (RPP). Data collected were reported as mean values with standard deviation. Statistical analysis using the Student's t test was performed and found significant for P<.05. Results: All changes from baseline were statistically insignificant, SBP (P=.4), DBP (P=.2), MAP (P=.2), P (P=.1), PP (P=.9), RPP (P=.5), RR (P=.9), and SpO2 (P=.4), and all within +/-20% of baseline (range, -5.0% to +7.5%). Conclusion: Midazolam and fentanyl intravenous sedation with local anesthesia maintained intraoperative hemodynamic and oxygenation variables close to baseline for office-based LAUP procedures.",0,0
26586566,Identification and interplay of sequence specific DNA binding proteins involved in regulation of human Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor gene,"Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR), a member of nuclear receptor superfamily, acts as a 'xenosensor' in our body and modulates a network of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and elimination. Expression levels of PXR in certain metabolic disorders including cancer are reported to be altered and its induced expression is associated with the development of resistance towards chemotherapy and adverse drug-drug interactions. Though the transcriptional regulation of PXR target genes have been elucidated in significant details, the structure and functional control of PXR promoter itself remains inadequately explored. In this work, we identify a Composite Element (CE) located within the proximal PXR promoter region that consists of multiple overlapping cis-elements and demonstrated that CE interacts specifically with some critical nuclear proteins. Subsequent DNA-protein interaction studies revealed mutually exclusive interactions on CE occurring between Sp1 and two unidentified DNA binding proteins with molecular masses of 50 and 54kDa. Here, we report the identification of 54kDa CE binding protein as a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) and demonstrate the effect of hnRNP K and Sp1 on PXR promoter transcriptional activity. Overall, the study indicates that PXR gene is tightly regulated to maintain a low receptor level.",0,0
22450528,"A prospective observational evaluation of an anatomically guided, logically formulated airway measure to predict difficult laryngoscopy","Context: Difficulty during tracheal intubation is the most common cause of serious adverse respiratory events for patients undergoing anaesthesia. Current traditional bedside predictors of difficult laryngoscopy have poor sensitivity. A simple method to accurately predict difficult laryngoscopy could greatly improve patient safety. Objectives: This study examined a novel bedside predictor of difficult laryngoscopy that calculates a ratio of measurements directly affecting the ability to achieve the necessary line of vision (NLV) from the larynx to the operator (NLV ratio). Design: This was a prospective observational study. Setting: A single tertiary care surgical centre. Patients: We enrolled 2046 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia with anticipated tracheal intubation. Intervention: Prior to surgery, patients had their NLV ratio and standard airway measures recorded. The anaesthesiologist who performed the intubation was blind to the airway assessment and recorded the best view of the larynx according to the Cormack and Lehane scale. Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as a grade 3 or 4 view. Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was the sensitivity and specificity of the NLV ratio measurement for predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Results: Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis of the NLV ratio revealed an optimal sensitivity of only 41% and specificity of 77%. Conclusion: Although our novel measurement performed similarly to traditional bedside predictors of difficult laryngoscopy, the sensitivity was too low for the test to be clinically useful. Numerous factors which may be very difficult to predict at the bedside probably contributed to the poor performance of this novel measurement.",0,0
22830131,Multiple airways. Rapid assessment is key for managing numerous patients,"Encountering a situation that necessitates the assessment and management of patients requiring airway management can present a significant challenge. It will require a different thought process and set of decision-making skills that vary from the routine practice of airway management during a single patient encounter. Rapid triaging of the need for airway management is important. Creating a categorization of those patients who simply need supplemental oxygen from those who require assistance with the mechanical opening of the airway, a need for positive-pressure ventilation and those who require protection from aspiration can be a useful starting place for the creation of a treatment plan. Treatment decisions will depend on the amount of equipment and personnel resources that are available. Non-traditional decision procedures and positioning may need to be implemented, such as placing patients in a lateral recumbent position to use gravity to assist in keeping the airway patent. In the setting of multiple patient encounters requiring airway management, it's important to consider the length of time each procedure will take and the amount of equipment that will be required. A rapid securing of the airway by a supraglottic device in suitable patients may be favored over traditional approaches of ETI secondary to the relative complexity of the procedure.",0,0
26528428,Difficult Intubation in Pediatric Patient with a Large Lymphangioma at the Tongue Base,"Lymphangioma is a congenital malformation of lymphatic system and often involves the oral cavity. When lymphangioma is located on the mouth floor and enlarges, it can compress the airway and make intubation difficult. The GlideScope(®) video laryngoscope is sometimes used in routine intubation, but is most commonly used in difficult or failed intubation. We report a pediatric patient with a difficult intubation due to a large tongue base mass. The airway was compromised due to limited intraoral space, large mass at the tongue base, and glottis distortion. Oral approach was not successful with the Macintosh laryngoscope. In this case, a rigid stylet was made to match the GlideScope(®) curve and the endo-tracheal tube was inserted through the glottis under GlideScope(®) guidance. We believe that, even in pediatric patients, a rigid stylet is necessary when intubation at a sharp posterior angulation to the trachea is difficult during GlideScope(®) approach.",0,0
21885980,Nasotracheal intubation using the Blind Intubation Device in anaesthetised adults with Mallampati class 3: a comparison with the Macintosh laryngoscope,"Context: We hypothesised that the Blind Intubation Device (BID) would be effective for nasotracheal intubation (NTI) in anaesthetised adults with Mallampati class 3. We also hypothesised that BID may cause less haemodynamic changes due to the avoidance of direct stimulation induced by the Macintosh blade. Objective: The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of the BID with the Macintosh laryngoscope for NTI in anaesthetised adults with Mallampati class 3. Design: A prospective randomised controlled study. Setting: Operation unit in a University Hospital in Shanghai. Period of the study was from September to November 2010. Patients or other participants: Mallampati class 3 adults requiring NTI for elective oral and maxillofacial surgery were randomly assigned to a BID group (n = 25) or a Macintosh laryngoscope group (ML group) (n = 25). Intervention: After anaesthesia induction, patients were intubated by a single anaesthesiologist experienced in using both devices. Main outcome measures: The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded at specific time points. NTI duration and success rate was compared. Epistaxis-associated and NTI-associated postoperative complications were assessed. Results: Compared with baseline values, there was a significant increase in MAP in both the BID and ML groups which persisted significantly longer in the ML group. The BID group showed a significantly attenuated MAP value within 30-60 s. The difference between the maximum MAP and the post-induction value was significantly greater in the ML group than in the BID group (64.4 ± 16.1 vs. 45.9 ± 16.1 mmHg, P = 0.0003). Compared with baseline values, there was a significant increase in HR in both groups which persisted longer in the ML group. There was a significantly higher first attempt success rate in the BID group compared with the ML group (100 vs. 76%, respectively, P = 0.022). The NTI duration was 36 s [interquartile range (IQR) 32-40] in the BID group and 33 s (IQR 25.5-41.5) in the ML group. Epistaxis during NTI was less frequent and less severe in the BID group (P = 0.031). Conclusion: In adults with Mallampati class 3, NTI using the BID caused an attenuated haemodynamic response and showed a higher success rate on the first attempt without increasing adverse events. The BID is an effective alternative to the Macintosh laryngoscope for NTI in anaesthetised adults with Mallampati class 3. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT 01170455.",0,0
8198766,Case of difficult intubation overcome by the laryngeal mask airway,A case of difficult intubation is described in which the problem was overcome by use of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA).

20707786,Use of the Ambu(®) aScope™ in 10 patients with predicted difficult intubation,"Fibreoptic intubation is the gold standard for patients with predicted difficult intubation. The Ambu(®) aScope™ is a single-use device for fibreoptic tracheal intubation. We assessed its performance in 10 patients with predicted difficult tracheal intubation. The procedure was easy and successful in nine patients. However, the limited time of use did not permit intubation in one patient who required three attempts with different size tracheal tubes. The limited image resolution that can be expected of a single-use fibreoptic system and the absence of a suction channel are other potential limitations. On the other hand, being single-use this device has the advantage of avoiding the risk of infectious disease transmission and is always ready to use.",0,0
16634559,[Newly developed BONFILS Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope for difficult airway],Battery powered BONFILS Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope (BRIF) is a nonflexible fiberscope having the same curvature as the Macintosh laryngoscope for difficult airway. We used this device in two patients; A 65-year-old man with small chin and a 35-year-old man with neck spinal cord injury. Two trials of orotracheal intubation were accomplished easily in 20 seconds. We conclude that BRIF is useful for orotracheal intubation in patients in whom neck extension is contra-indicated.,0,0
12488371,Randomized evaluation of the performance of single-use laryngoscopes in simulated easy and difficult intubation,"Background: Single-use laryngoscopes are becoming used more widely. Methods: We compared six types of single-use laryngoscope with the standard Macintosh laryngoscope using the Laerdal SimMan patient simulator. Twenty anaesthetists attempted to intubate the simulator with standardized airway settings allowing a full view of the vocal cords ('easy intubation'). The airway settings were then changed so that only the posterior part of the glottis was visible ('difficult intubation') and the anaesthetists were asked to intubate the simulator again. Results: The time to intubate with the standard laryngoscope was less in both easy (P<0.05) and difficult (P<0.01) intubations. The performance of five laryngoscopes during easy intubation (P<0.01) and four during difficult intubation (P<0.001) was significantly worse than that of the Macintosh. There was a significant difference in Cormack and Lehane grading between the laryngoscopes tested in both easy (P<0.05) and difficult (P<0.05) intubation. The percentage of glottic opening visible (POGO score) also differed between laryngoscopes in both the easy (P<0.01) and difficult (P<0.001) groups. The highest POGO scores were obtained with the Macintosh laryngoscope. During the difficult intubation simulation, the reusable Macintosh laryngoscope needed less use of a bougie and had fewer failed intubations than the single-use laryngoscopes, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Of the laryngoscopes tested, the standard reusable Macintosh laryngoscope performed best. The Europa was the best single-use laryngoscope. Some single-use laryngoscopes tested were significantly inferior to the Macintosh. This raises concern over their use in clinical practice, particularly if intubation is difficult.",0,0
21410362,Reducing nasopharyngeal trauma: the urethral catheter-assisted nasotracheal intubation technique,"Nasal intubation is an advantageous approach for dental procedures performed in the hospital, ambulatory surgery center, or dental office, when possible. Although many who provide anesthesia services are familiar and comfortable with nasal intubation techniques, some are reluctant and uncomfortable because of lack of experience or fear of nasopharyngeal bleeding and trauma. It has been observed from experiences in various settings that many approaches may be adapted to the technique of achieving nasal intubation. The technique that is described in this paper suggests a minimally invasive approach that introduces the nasoendotracheal tube through the nasopharyngeal pathway to the oropharynx in an expedient manner while preserving the nasopharyngeal structures, thus lessening nasal bleeding and trauma to soft tissues. The technique uses a common urethral catheter and can be incorporated along with current intubation armamentaria. As with all techniques, some limitations to the approach have been identified and are described in this paper. Cases with limited mouth opening, neck injury, and difficult airways may necessitate alternative methods. However, the short learning curve along with the many benefits of this technique offers the anesthesia professional additional options for excellent patient care.",0,0
9640165,Video-intuboscopy: a new aid to routine and difficult tracheal intubation,"Video-intuboscopy gives a video display of the view from the tip of the tracheal tube during conventional laryngoscopy, and was developed particularly to assist the immediate management of unexpected difficult intubation. A lightweight, malleable video-optical intubation stylet transmits the view from the stylet tip onto a monitor. It is inserted in the tracheal tube before starting anaesthesia, and the view from the tracheal tube tip enables the anaesthetist to verify tracheal tube position in the trachea. During difficult intubation the video view is used to guide the tracheal tube into the trachea. When used to allow confirmation of tracheal placement, the system did not interfere with conventional intubation procedures. The method showed the subglottic airway, gave immediate confirmation of tracheal tube position, and aided teaching and supervision. The method was used to guide intubation in two patients with unanticipated grade 3 laryngoscopic views. Intubation was simple, rapid and atraumatic, without the need for head, neck or laryngeal manipulation. Tracheal placement was instantly confirmed using the video view from the stylet tip. Clinical studies are required to define the value of this new intubation technique.",0,0
15976247,The reliability and validity of the upper lip bite test compared with the Mallampati classification to predict difficult laryngoscopy: an external prospective evaluation,"Recently, a new bedside screening test to predict the occurrence of a difficult laryngoscopy has been developed as a substitute for the Mallampati classification. The Upper-Lip-Bite test (ULBT) evaluated the patient's ability to reach or completely cover the upper lip with the lower incisors. It is often accepted that new predictive tools should undergo an external evaluation before the tool is used in clinical practice. Thus, we evaluated this test with respect to applicability, interobserver reliability, and discriminating power and compared it with the Mallampati-score (using Samsoon and Young's modification). The ULBT could not be applied in 12% of all patients (Mallampati score, <1%). However, the interobserver reliability was better for the ULBT (kappa = 0.79 versus kappa = 0.59). The discriminating power to predict a patient with difficult laryngoscopy was evaluated in 1425 consecutive patients. Both tests were assessed simultaneously in these patients by two specially trained independent observers. After the induction of anesthesia, the laryngoscopic view was assessed by the attending anesthesiologist using the classification of Cormack and Lehane. A grade I or II was called easy laryngoscopy and grade III and IV difficult laryngoscopy. The discriminating power for both tests was low (0.60 for the ULBT [95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.63] and 0.66 [0.63-0.69]) for the Mallampati score), indicating that both tests are poor predictors as single screening tests.",1,1
25388828,Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE): a physiological method of increasing apnoea time in patients with difficult airways,"Emergency and difficult tracheal intubations are hazardous undertakings where successive laryngoscopy-hypoxaemia-re-oxygenation cycles can escalate to airway loss and the 'can't intubate, can't ventilate' scenario. Between 2013 and 2014, we extended the apnoea times of 25 patients with difficult airways who were undergoing general anaesthesia for hypopharyngeal or laryngotracheal surgery. This was achieved through continuous delivery of transnasal high-flow humidified oxygen, initially to provide pre-oxygenation, and continuing as post-oxygenation during intravenous induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular blockade until a definitive airway was secured. Apnoea time commenced at administration of neuromuscular blockade and ended with commencement of jet ventilation, positive-pressure ventilation or recommencement of spontaneous ventilation. During this time, upper airway patency was maintained with jaw-thrust. Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) was used in 15 males and 10 females. Mean (SD [range]) age at treatment was 49 (15 [25-81]) years. The median (IQR [range]) Mallampati grade was 3 (2-3 [2-4]) and direct laryngoscopy grade was 3 (3-3 [2-4]). There were 12 obese patients and nine patients were stridulous. The median (IQR [range]) apnoea time was 14 (9-19 [5-65]) min. No patient experienced arterial desaturation < 90%. Mean (SD [range]) post-apnoea end-tidal (and in four patients, arterial) carbon dioxide level was 7.8 (2.4 [4.9-15.3]) kPa. The rate of increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide was 0.15 kPa.min(-1) . We conclude that THRIVE combines the benefits of 'classical' apnoeic oxygenation with continuous positive airway pressure and gaseous exchange through flow-dependent deadspace flushing. It has the potential to transform the practice of anaesthesia by changing the nature of securing a definitive airway in emergency and difficult intubations from a pressured stop-start process to a smooth and unhurried undertaking.",0,0
21957403,A comparison of the ratio of patient's height to thyromental distance with the modified Mallampati and the upper lip bite test in predicting difficult laryngoscopy,"Background: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE ABILITY TO PREDICT DIFFICULT VISUALIZATION OF THE LARYNX FROM THE FOLLOWING PREOPERATIVE AIRWAY PREDICTIVE INDICES, IN ISOLATION AND COMBINATION: modified Mallampati test (MMT), the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD) and the Upper-Lip-Bite test (ULBT). Methods: We collected data on 603 consecutive patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation and then evaluated all three factors before surgery. An experienced anesthesiologist, not informed of the recorded preoperative airway evaluation, performed the laryngoscopy and grading (as per Cormack and Lehane's classification). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve and the area under ROC curve (AUC) for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Results: Difficult laryngoscopy (Grade 3 or 4) occurred in 41 (6.8%) patients. The main endpoint of the present study, the AUC of the ROC, was significantly lower for the MMT (AUC, 0.511; 95% CI, 0.470-0.552) than the ULBT (AUC, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.671-0.745, P=0.002) and the RHTMD score (AUC, 0.711; 95% CI, 0.673-0.747, P=0.001). There was no significant difference between the AUC of the ROC for the ULBT and the RHTMD score. By using discrimination analysis, the optimal cutoff point for the RHTMD for predicting difficult laryngoscopy was 21.06 (sensitivity, 75.6%; specificity, 58.5%). Conclusion: The RHTMD is comparable with ULBT for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in general population.",0,1
17456667,The novel use of computer-generated virtual imaging to assess the difficult pediatric airway,"In a patient with a known difficult airway, history and examination may be of limited use in formulating a management plan for subsequent tracheal intubation. Further detailed and descriptive review of the airway is necessary. Virtual imaging is a recent advance in radiology that offers noninvasive airway assessment. It creates a movie clip image of the upper airway akin to the view obtained through a fiberscope. We present a patient with Goldenhar syndrome in whom virtual imaging was used to identify the cause of a previous failed tracheal intubation.",0,0
19923516,Difficult mask ventilation,"Mask ventilation is the most fundamental skill in airway management. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about difficult mask ventilation (DMV) situations. Various definitions for DMV have been used in the literature. The lack of a precise standard definition creates a problem for studies on DMV and causes confusion in data communication and comparisons. DMV develops because of multiple factors that are technique related and/or airway related. Frequently, the pathogenesis involves a combination of these factors interacting to cause the final clinical picture. The reported incidence of DMV varies widely (from 0.08% to 15%) depending on the criteria used for its definition. Obesity, age older than 55 yr, history of snoring, lack of teeth, the presence of a beard, Mallampati Class III or IV, and abnormal mandibular protrusion test are all independent predictors of DMV. These signs should, therefore, be recognized and documented during the preoperative evaluation. DMV can be even more challenging in infants and children, because they develop hypoxemia much faster than adults. Finally, difficult tracheal intubation is more frequent in patients who experience DMV, and thus, clinicians should be familiar with the corrective measures and management options when faced with a challenging, difficult, or impossible mask ventilation situation.",0,0
16458616,Influence of innocuous cervical vertebral movement on the efferent innervation of the adrenal gland in the rat,"In general, in central nervous system intact anesthetized animals, adrenal sympathetic efferent nerve activity and catecholamine secretion increase in response to noxious somatic stimulation, and decrease in response to innocuous somatic stimulation. In anesthetized rats, noxious chemical stimulation of the thoracic and lumbar interspinous tissues is associated with large increases in adrenal sympathetic efferent nerve activity and catecholamine secretion, with a clear segmental organization to the reflex apparent in spinalized animals. However, the adrenal sympathetic nerve responses to mechanical stimulation in the form of pressure applied laterally to the lower thoracic and lower lumbar vertebrae do not display segmental organization, and the depressor response is more characteristic of responses to innocuous somatic stimulation despite the use of large forces (up to 3.0 kg). Therefore, we sought to determine whether innocuous movements of the mechanoreceptor-rich deep tissues of the neck modulate the sympathetic outflow to the adrenal gland. We performed experiments in 14 anaesthetised (Urethane 1 g/kg and Chloralose 0.1 g/kg) adult rats. Rats were intubated and breathed spontaneously. A computer driven small animal manipulator was used to impose ramp and hold rotational displacements (12 degrees /s, hold duration 2 s) of the 2nd cervical vertebra (range 2-30 degrees ) while recording multi-unit activity from sympathetic nerves innervating the adrenal gland. While noxious forepaw pinch elicited an increase in sympathetic nerve activity to the adrenal gland, there was no significant change in sympathetic nerve activity with small (2 degrees or 6 degrees ) rotations. Significant changes (P<0.05) in sympathetic activity were observed in only 7% (n=21) of all trials at larger displacements (12 degrees , 20 degrees , 25 degrees , 30 degrees n=287 trials). Our data suggest that although noxious stimuli may modulate sympathetic outflow, it is rare for afferents signalling innocuous cervical vertebral movements to modulate sympathetic nerves innervating the adrenal gland.",0,0
22985184,Cuff filling volumes for pediatric classic laryngeal mask airways: comparison of clinical end points versus adjusted cuff pressure,"Background: Clinical end points are often used to guide inflation and adequacy of cuff seal after laryngeal mask airway placement. However, clinical end points for cuff inflation have been shown to have significantly higher intracuff pressure. The adjusted cuff pressure between 55 and 60 cm H(2)O causes significantly better seal of laryngeal mask airway. We prospectively assessed the cuff pressures generated by cuff inflation guided by clinical end points, and the actual volume of air required to achieve cuff pressures between 55 and 60 cm H(2)O for sizes 1-2.5 reusable classic laryngeal mask airway. Methods: Two hundred and three ASA I and II children undergoing elective cataract surgery requiring general anesthesia receiving laryngeal mask airway sizes 1-2.5 were recruited to this study. The laryngeal mask airway was placed using standard technique. After insertion of laryngeal mask airway, the cuff was slowly inflated until a slight outward shift of device was noted. Cuff pressures were measured using calibrated hand held Portex Cuff Inflator Pressure Gauge (Portex Limited, Hythe, Kent, UK). If the cuff pressure was >60 cm H(2)O, the cuff was deflated to achieve a cuff pressure of 55-60 cm H(2)O. The volume of air required to achieve this pressure was recorded. Results: The volume of air required to achieve the pressure between 55 and 60 cm H(2)O in laryngeal mask airway size 1, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 were 2.750 ± 0.2565, 4.951 ± 0.5378, 6.927 ± 0.6328, and 10.208 ± 1.4535 ml, respectively. The difference between the initial and the final cuff volumes and pressures in all laryngeal mask airway sizes were statistically significant(P = 0.000). Conclusion: Lower cuff volumes are required to achieve a pressure of 60 cm H(2)O than those required if clinical end points are used as a sole guide for determining cuff inflation for patients receiving pediatric laryngeal mask airways.",0,0
8538009,[Anesthetic management of a Paget's disease patient complicated with Parkinson disease],"Paget's disease is a metabolic disorder of unknown etiology characterized by excessively rapid remolding of bone. We report a case of Paget's disease complicated with Parkinson syndrome. A 69-year-old female patient was scheduled for ventriculo-peritoneostomy due to hydrocephalus. Her manifestations included disability to walk, slight deafness and muscular rigidity of limbs, without symptom of intracranial hypertension. After induction of anesthesia with thiopental and vecuronium, tracheal intubation with Macintosh laryngoscope was attempted but failed because mouth opening was restricted to only 3 cm. Again with Bullard laryngoscope, she was successfully intubated. During neurosurgical operation, the anesthesia was maintained with low concentration of isoflurane (under 0.3%), nitrous oxide and oxygen. The surgery was completed without adverse events such as disorder of autonomic nervous system. However 6-days after operation, ventilatory arrest occurred due to bronchial obstruction with sputum. Immediately, re-intubation was performed without any sequela and tracheostomy was also performed. In conclusion, as reported previously, intubation and postoperative pulmonary dysfunction should be carefully taken care of, and Bullard laryngoscope was useful for this patient.",0,0

16389541,[Intraoperative and postoperative analgesia with a caudal catheter in a child suffering from Schwartz-Jampel syndrome],"The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, also known as myotonia chondrodystrophica, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone dysplasia, growth retardation and generalized myotonia. Laryngoscopy and intubation may be difficult because of micrognathia and limited mouth opening due to myotonia of the masseter muscles. As regional anaesthesia reduces myotonic contractions and avoids administration of opioids causing respiratory depression, it appears to be the ideal method for postoperative analgesia. We report on a 5-year-old girl who underwent osteotomy of both hips and received intraoperative and postoperative analgesia via a caudal catheter. Excellent analgesia without myoclonic episodes could be achieved by continuous infusion of ropivacaine.",0,0
24530085,[Difficult intubation: should follow the recommendations],"Intubation and ventilation impossible mask is a dramatic situation with potentially serious consequences. We report the case of a patient of 43 years, followed for a goiter, which was scheduled for a total thyroidectomy under general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation is not noted signs of compression or tracheal deviation, and there were no criteria predictive of intubation or difficult mask ventilation. The induction of anesthesia was standard. Mask ventilation was effective allowing paralysis. The standard laryngoscopy showed a score of Cormack and Lehane grade IV. Several attempts at intubation were made leading to a situation of intubation and ventilation impossible mask with deep desaturation. A tracheostomy was done urgently. The patient was operated on, six months later, with a fiber optic intubation. Through this case, the authors draw attention to the difficulty of achieving an emergency tracheotomy in the presence of goiter and emphasize the need for integration of different modes of learning and retention of management skills of the upper airway.",0,0
19735399,A documented previous difficult tracheal intubation as a prognostic test for a subsequent difficult tracheal intubation in adults,"We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of a documented previous difficult tracheal intubation as a stand-alone test for predicting a subsequent difficult intubation. Our assessment included patients from the Danish Anaesthesia Database who were scheduled for tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy. We used a four-point scale to grade the tracheal intubation. A previous difficult intubation was defined according to the presence of a record documenting a difficult penultimate tracheal intubation-score for the 15 499 patients anaesthetised more than once. Our assessment demonstrates that a documented history of previous difficult or failed intubation using direct laryngoscopy are strong predictors of a subsequent difficult or failed intubation and may identify 30% of these patients. Although previous investigators have reported predictive values that exceed our findings markedly, a documented previous difficult or failed tracheal intubation appears in everyday anaesthetic practice to be a strong predictor of a subsequent difficult tracheal intubation.",1,1
12047693,Tracheobronchography and angiocardiography of paediatric cardiac patients with airway disorders,"Objective: We report our experience in combining tracheobronchography and angiocardiography in the assessment of a selected cohort of paediatric cardiac patients with problematic airway disorders. Methodology: The clinical records of 11 patients who underwent 17 studies at a median age of 5.5 months (range 3 months to 10.8 years) were reviewed. Tracheobronchography and angiocardiography were performed under general anaesthesia using a non-ionic contrast agent. The findings were compared with those of flexible bronchoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Seven patients had cardiac lesions associated with vascular anomalies potentially compressing the airway, while four had no identifiable aberrant or enlarged vessels. All examinations but one were performed without complications. Tracheobronchography demonstrated extrinsic vascular compression with secondary airway malacia in three (27%), intrinsic tracheobronchial stenosis in five (45%), and airway malacia in three patients (27%). Precise measurement of the airway calibre and real-time fluoroscopic monitoring facilitated transcatheter tracheobronchial interventions (six balloon dilations, three stent implantations) in four patients. In conjunction with angiocardiography, cine-tracheobronchography provided detailed information on the spatial relationship between vascular and airway structures in all patients; allowed dynamic assessment of airway malacia; and facilitated preoperative planning in six patients. In contrast, bronchoscopy failed to differentiate malacia from extrinsic compression in four patients (36%), while MRI, performed in six patients, was unsatisfactory in one due to a motion artefact and failed to diagnose airway malacia and extrinsic compression in three patients. Conclusions: Tracheobronchography is relatively safe in paediatric cardiac patients. Combined tracheobronchography and angiocardiography, a less operator-dependent imaging modality compared to bronchoscopy and MRI, delineated the airway and vascular anatomy in detail; facilitated preoperative planning; and permitted transcatheter tracheo-bronchial interventions. The dynamic capability of tracheobronchography supplements that of flexible bronchoscopy and MRI in the diagnosis of airway malacia.",0,0
8831311,Pseudoankylosis of the mandible after supratentorial craniotomy,"After temporal craniotomy, pseudoankylosis of the mandible can cause difficult airway management during subsequent anesthesia. However, postcraniotomy changes in maximal mouth opening and the incidence of limited mouth opening have not been characterized. Ninety-two adult patients who underwent elective craniotomy were divided into three groups: Group A (n = 28) included patients who underwent parietal, occipital, or frontal craniotomy without incision of the temporalis muscles; Group B (n = 25) included patients who underwent temporal craniotomy; and Group C (n = 39) included patients who underwent frontotemporal craniotomy. Maximal mouth opening (interincisor gap) and the frequency of limited mouth opening (maximum mouth opening < or = 2.5 cm) were evaluated before operation and 3 days, 1 wk, 2 wk, 1 mo, and 3 mo after operation. The three groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, body weight, height, operative time, anesthetic time, or maximum mouth opening before operation. The postoperative reduction in maximal mouth opening was significantly greater in Group C than in Group B. In Group C, the incidence of limited mouth opening was 33.3% and 20.5% 2 wk and 1 mo after operation, respectively; however, limited mouth opening resolved within 3 mo in most patients. Supratentorial craniotomies separated by short intervals can increase the risk of limiting the mandibular opening, which may result in a difficult intubation. Careful preoperative assessment of the airway is mandatory if patients have previously undergone temporal or frontotemporal craniotomy.",0,0
22430340,Outcomes of intubation in difficult airways due to head and neck pathology,"The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of surgical pathology, anesthesiologist experience, and airway technique on surgically relevant outcomes in patients identified by preoperative laryngoscopy to have a difficult airway due to head and neck pathology. We prospectively recorded a series of 152 difficult airway cases due to head and neck pathology out of 2,145 direct laryngoscopies undertaken between November 2005 and June 2008. One of two senior anesthesiologists specializing in head and neck procedures intubated 101 (66.4%) of the 152 patients and did so 3.3 minutes faster (p = 0.51), with better oxygenation (87.3 vs. 81.8%; p = 0.02) and fewer airway plan changes (p = 0.001) than did other, nonspecialist anesthesiologists. Predictors of failure of the first intubation plan included: cancer diagnosis (p = 0.02), previous radiotherapy (p = 0.03), and supraglottic lesions (p = 0.03). Glottic/subglottic lesions required the most intubation attempts (p = 0.02). Awake fiberoptic intubation was the most common method used (44.7%) but resulted in a change in the airway plan in 6 cases (8.8%). Gas induction maintained the best oxygenation (p = 0.01). Awake tracheostomy was infrequent (1.3%) and took the longest (p = 0.006). We concluded that difficult airways due to head and neck pathology require teamwork and a backup plan. An anesthesiologist specializing in head and neck procedures may help to avoid adverse outcomes associated with cancer, especially previously irradiated supraglottic/glottic lesions, leading to a less frequent need for awake tracheostomy.",0,0
19378545,Blind nasotracheal intubation in awaken patient scheduled for hemimandibulectomy. Case report,"Background and objectives: Several resources can be used for the approach of the airways. Maintaining a patient awake when control of ventilation/oxygenation is uncertain is an option when intubation is doubtful. Blind nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is an alternative to fiberoptic endoscopy. Case report: A 75-year old patient, weighing 56 kg, was scheduled for hemimandibulectomy; she presented cervical immobility secondary to arthrodesis, mouth opening of 2.2 cm, moderate retrognatism, voluntary protrusion of the mandible was absent, mentostemal distance of 11 cm and mento-thyroid distance of 6 cm, therefore receiving a score of 5 on the Wilson scale. The patient signed an informed consent after being informed about the procedure. After monitoring and oxygenation, continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine was initiated. Superior and inferior laryngeal nerve block was performed with 2.0% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor and the hypopharinx was anesthetized with a lidocaine spray. Before NTI, ondansetron, midazolam, fentanyl, and droperidol were administered and the patient remained awake and cooperative. Nasal insertion of the tracheal tube was oriented by its opacification and respiratory sounds and the placement was confirmed by pulmonary auscultation and capnography. Continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil was instituted, vecuronium was administered and controlled ventilation was initiated. The surgery lasted 60 minutes without intercurrences. At the end, the patient was breathing spontaneously, so she was extubated and transferred to the recovery room from where she was discharged without any complaints. Conclusion: Nasotracheal intubation is an alternative to fiberoptic endoscopy when safety and control of the airways is uncertain. Informing the patient about the procedure was essential. Safety was assured and respiratory depression and hemodynamic instability was not observed.",0,0
16779841,"Physiologic, bronchoscopic, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid findings in young children with recurrent wheeze and cough","Assessing airway disease in young children with wheeze and/or cough is challenging. We conducted a prospective, descriptive study of lung function in children <3 years old with recurrent wheeze and/or cough, who had failed empiric antiasthma and/or antireflux therapy and subsequently underwent flexible bronchoscopy. Our goals were to describe radiographic, anatomical, microbiological, and physiological findings in these children, and generate hypotheses about their respiratory physiology. Plethysmography and raised-volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RVRTC) techniques were performed prior to bronchoscopy. Mean Z-scores (n = 19) were -1.34 for forced expiratory volume at 0.5 sec (FEV(0.5)), -2.28 for forced expiratory flows at 75% of forced vital capacity (FVC) (FEF(75)), -2.25 for forced expiratory flows between 25-75% of FVC (FEF(25-75)), 2.53 for functional residual capacity (FRC), and 2.23 for residual volume divided by total lung capacity (RV/TLC). Younger, shorter children had markedly depressed FEF(75) and FEF(25-75) Z-scores (P = 0.002 and P = <0.001, respectively). As expected, lower airway anatomical abnormalities, infection, and inflammation were common. Elevated FRC was associated with anatomical lower airway abnormalities (P = 0.03). FVC was higher in subjects with neutrophilic inflammation (P = 0.03). There was no association between other physiologic variables and bronchoscopic/bronchoalveolar lavage fluid findings. Half of those with elevated RV/TLC ratios (Z-score >2) had no evidence of chest radiograph hyperinflation. We conclude that in this population, plethysmography and RVRTC techniques are useful in identifying severity of hyperinflation and airflow obstruction, and we hypothesize that younger children may have relatively small airways caliber, significantly limiting airflow, and thus impairing secretion clearance and predisposing to lower airway infection.",0,0
23217485,Fiberoptic intubation in a paediatric patient with severe temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis,"Craniofacial abnormalities are associated with mandibular hypoplasia, reduced mandibular space with overcrowding of soft tissues and maxillary hypoplasia. Decreased mouth opening and limitation in jaw protrusion are independent predictors of difficult airway in such patients. The relative difficult problem becomes even graver in the paediatric age group because of their small mouth opening and un-cooperativeness. A child with severe temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis presented with negligible mouth opening and required surgical correction under general anaesthesia. Successful intubation was performed with endotracheal tube size 5.5 mm using an adult 4.3 mm fiberoptic bronchoscope under inhalational as well as topical anaesthesia.",0,0
21666944,Investigation of the availability of tongue movements in Mallampati classification,"Objective: To investigate the relation of Mallampati classification with a new alternative method suggested for use in the estimation of tongue movements. Methods: This study was conducted in the Department of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey from April to October 2009. Two hundred and thirty patients were enrolled in this study. The modified Mallampati score (MMS) was devised by an anesthetist. To define tongue movements, horizontal and vertical lines were utilized. Horizontal lines passing through the mid points of the upper lip and mandible, and vertical lines passing through the right and left infraorbital points were constituted on each subject. Subjects were asked to elevate, depress, and abduct (right-left) the tip of the tongue. The scores corresponding with the movements of the tongue were determined. Results: Depression of the tip of the tongue (DTT) and elevation of the tip of the tongue (ETT) levels were significantly different between MMS 1, MMS 2, and MMS 3, MMS 4 groups (p=0.001). The risk of being MMS 3 or MMS 4 for the groups that cannot reach the borderline for the DTT or ETT are 5.5 times and 5.4 times higher consequently than the groups that can reach the borderline. Conclusion: This new method can be combined with MMS classification, which requires clinical experience and knowledge in predicting difficult intubation.",0,0
27563611,Distraction osteogenesis in the treatment of temporomandibular joint ankylosis with mandibular micrognathia,"Aims: The aims of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of simultaneous interpositional arthroplasty with distraction osteogenesis (DO) as a single procedure and to give the patient acceptable functional rehabilitation with correction of the gross facial asymmetry. Materials and methods: Nine patients of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis with micrognathia were treated with interpositional arthroplasty and simultaneous DO and followed for a period of minimum 3 years. Preoperative, immediate postoperative, at the end of distraction, at 6 months and 3 years postdistraction consolidation radiographs were taken along with the clinical examination for mouth opening, deviation, length of the mandible and ramus, midline shift, occlusal cant, and occlusion. Results: The results showed an increase in the mouth opening, length of the mandible and ramus height, correction of deviation, occlusion, and midline shift. Relapse was not seen in any case, rather one patient developed infection at the distractor site and two patients had fracture of the roots of the teeth at the osteotomy site. There was an overall improvement in the facial asymmetry. Conclusion: Simultaneous interpositional arthroplasty with DO should be used to correct TMJ ankylosis associated with facial asymmetry/micrognathia, as it reduces the need for second surgery, thereby saving the trauma of a second surgery and difficulty in intubation, increases the length of the mandible, corrects the deformity, thereby resulting in an acceptable facial esthetics and function.",0,0
16651910,Pediatric laryngoscope blade size selection using facial landmarks,"Objectives: The study evaluates whether facial landmarks can be used to estimate an appropriate laryngoscope blade length for oral endotracheal intubation in children. We tested the hypothesis that the laryngoscope blade measuring 10 mm or less distal or proximal to the angle of the mandible (when the flat portion of the blade follows the facial contour from the upper incisor teeth to the angle of the mandible) will demonstrate greater success and ease of oral tracheal intubation. Methods: We performed an observational study that prospectively evaluated a convenience sample of children 8 years old or younger and who were undergoing direct laryngoscopy for oral endotracheal intubation in the operating room, outpatient surgery center, emergency department, or pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary referral medical center. Ease and success of oral tracheal intubation were compared with distance measurements from the angle of the mandible to the tip of the laryngoscope blade. Results: Blade lengths considered too short (blade lengths >10 mm proximal to the angle of the mandible) were more likely to be associated with more than 1 attempt at intubation. Only 57.1% (12/21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 36.5-75.5) of the intubations using the shorter blade were performed on the first attempt as compared with 89.7% (26/29; 95% CI, 73.6-96.4) of the intubations using the recommended length or 85.7% (6/7; 95% CI, 48.7-97.4) of the intubations using blades extending longer than 10 mm past the angle of the mandible. Conclusions: The distance from the upper incisor teeth to the angle of the jaw seems to be an excellent clinical landmark for laryngoscope blade length selection for pediatric intubations. When the blade (excluding the handle insertion block) is placed at the upper midline incisor teeth and the tip is located within 1 cm proximal or distal to the angle of the mandible, oral tracheal intubations are more consistently accomplished on the first attempt. Our observations suggest that facial landmarks can be used to estimate an appropriate laryngoscope blade length for oral endotracheal intubation in children.",0,0
21226865,Evaluation of the Pentax-AWS(®) and the Macintosh laryngoscope in difficult intubation: a manikin study,"Background: The Pentax-AWS (AWS(®)), a new video laryngoscope, has been shown to be useful in cases of difficult intubation. We hypothesized that the AWS(®) would be more useful in the settings of a narrow upper airway than the Macintosh laryngoscope. We compared each device in simulated scenarios of representative difficulty of tracheal intubation using a manikin. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intubation. Methods: With each device, 23 anesthesiologists performed tracheal intubation in a SimMan(®) manikin in the following scenarios: (1) normal airway, (2) tongue edema, (3) cervical spine rigidity, (4) pharyngeal obstruction, (5) jaw trismus, (6) tongue edema with pharyngeal obstruction. The intubation time and success rate were measured. Each participant was asked to rate the difficulty of intubation (1=very easy; 5=very difficult). Results: In the scenarios of tongue edema and tongue edema with pharyngeal obstruction, the AWS(®) yielded a higher success rate (100% vs. 34.8%; P<0.001, 65.2% vs. 21.7%; P=0.006), a shorter intubation time [14.6 (7.0) vs. 33.4 (13.0) s; P<0.001, 24.5 (12.0) vs. 37.6 (11.9); P=0.047; mean (standard deviation)], and a lower difficulty score [2 (1-4) vs. 5 (1-5); P<0.001, 4 (2-5) vs. 5 (3-5); P<0.001; median (range)], compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope. Conclusion: The AWS(®) has an advantage over the Macintosh laryngoscope in simulated tongue edema and tongue edema with pharyngeal obstruction. Further studies in a clinical setting are necessary to confirm these findings.",0,0
26429742,Outcome of adenotonsillectomy for children with sleep apnea,"Background and objectives: The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is about 1%-4.9% in children aged 2-18 years. This is a prospective study carried out to evaluate the role of adenotonsillectomy (AT) in pediatric sleep apnea. Methods: Fifty children aged less than 15 years presenting with the chief complaints of snoring, mouth breathing, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and adenotonsillar hypertrophy were included in the study. Physical examination included body mass index (BMI) z-score, orodental and nasal examination, modified Mallampati scoring; whole-night level I polysomnography was conducted and repeated after three to six months of AT. Results: The mean preoperative BMI z-score was -0.76, which improved significantly to -0.15 (p < 0.001) after AT. A negative correlation was seen between respiratory distress index (RDI) and pre surgery BMI z-score. As per pre-operative RDI, OSA was classified mild in 6.7% children (31.1% as per apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]), moderate in 35.6% (31.1% as per AHI), and severe in 57.8% (37.8% as per AHI). The average RDI value reduced significantly from 16.2 ± 10.7 to 6.46 ± 4.8 (p < 0.001) and AHI from 8.5 (SD ± 5.7) to 1.3 (SD ± 1) post-operatively. Only 6.7% children could be cured with surgery, of whom none belonged to moderate or severe category. Multivariate analysis shows that initial severity of disease, modified Mallampati scores III and IV, high-arched palate, and age above eight years were associated with significant residual disease after AT. Conclusion: AT was associated with a statistically significant change in RDI and AHI. However, complete resolution of OSA could be seen in a small percentage of patients with a mild degree of disease.",0,0
21051035,Prevention of dental damage and improvement of difficult intubation using a paraglossal technique with a straight Miller blade,"Patients with diseased teeth, or those who are difficult to intubate, have a higher risk of dental injury during laryngoscopy. We report 3 cases of smooth endotracheal intubation using a paraglossal technique with a straight Miller blade in patients with poor dentition. Three patients with poor dentition were scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia. All patients presented with extremely loose upper central incisors and had lost the other right upper teeth, while micrognathia and prominent, loose upper incisors were noted in 1 case. We elected to use a straight Miller blade using a paraglossal approach. A nasopharyngeal airway was inserted after induction of general anesthesia to facilitate mask ventilation and prevent air leakage from the mask. The Miller blade was then inserted from the right corner of the mouth, avoiding contact with the vulnerable incisors, and advanced along the groove between the tongue and tonsil. The endotracheal tube was subsequently smoothly inserted after obtaining a grade 1 Cormack and Lehane view without dental trauma in all 3 cases. Direct laryngoscopy using the paraglossal straight blade technique avoids dental damage in patients with mobile upper incisors and no right maxillary molars. It is a practical alternative method that differs from the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with a high risk of dental injury during the procedure. This technique, which provides an improved view of the larynx, might also be helpful with patients in whom intubation is difficult.",0,0
26526473,[Diagnostic utility of the hyomental distance ratio as predictor of difficult intubation at UMAE 25],"Background: The hyomental distance ratio is defined as the ratio of the hyomental distances in neutral position and at head extension. The aim of the study was to establish the diagnostic utility as predictor of difficult intubation. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, the assessment of the airway was performed in 70 patients (35 male and 35 female, 15-75 years old) undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for elective surgery. We assessed Mallampati, Patil Aldreti, interincisive distance, Bellhouse Doré scales and hyomental distance ratio. Subsequently, laryngoscopy was performed and the view graded with Cormack scale. We define ""difficult intubation"" as Cormack III and IV. We determined the diagnostic utility of the scales and the hyomental distance ratio. Results: For hyomental distance ratio of ≤ 1.2 we calculated sensitivity, 60%; specificity, 20%; positive predictive value, 5%; negative predictive value, 86%; positive likelihood ratio of 0.75 and negative likelihood ratio of 2.

23646239,The causes of difficult tracheal intubation and preoperative assessments in different age groups,"Background: We studied the differences in airway assessment factors among old, middle, and young age groups, and evaluated the frequency and causes of difficult intubation among these groups. Methods: Patients were divided into young (< 40 yr, n = 75 ), middle (40-59 yr, n = 83), and old (≥ 60 yr, n = 89) group. Airway assessment factors such as head and neck movement, thyromental distance, interincisor gap, dentition, Mallampati score, and Arné score were assessed. After muscle relaxation, cervical joint rigidity and Cormack-Lehane (C-L) grade were assessed. The differences in airway assessment factors between difficult (C-L grade 3, 4) and easy (C-L grade 1, 2) intubation were then examined. Logistic regression analysis was also carried out to identify the extent to which airway assessment factors reflected difficult intubation. Results: As aging, head and neck movement, thyromental distance, and interincisor gap decreased, the grade of dentition, Mallampati score, cervical joint rigidity and the ratio of Arné score > 11 increased. In the old and middle group, the incidence of difficult intubation was increased compared with the young group. Dentition in the young group, Mallampati score and interinsisor gap in the middle group and Mallampati score, cervical joint rigidity in the old group respectively predicted difficult intubation. Conclusions: Compared to young individuals, middle-aged or elderly adults are likely to experience more difficulty in endotracheal intubation and its predictive factors could vary by age group.",0,1
23555331,Airway somatosensory deficits and dysphagia in Parkinson's disease,"Background: Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) often experience substantial impairment of swallow control, and are typically unaware of the presence or severity of their impairments suggesting that these individuals may also experience airway sensory deficits. However, the degree to which impaired swallow function in PD may relate to airway sensory deficits has yet to be formally tested. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine whether airway sensory function is associated with swallow impairment in PD. Methods: Eighteen PD participants and 18 healthy controls participated in this study and underwent endoscopic assessment of airway somatosensory function, endoscopic assessment of swallow function, and clinical ratings of swallow and disease severity. Results: PD participants exhibited abnormal airway somatosensory function and greater swallow impairment compared with healthy controls. Swallow and sensory deficits in PD were correlated with disease severity. Moreover, PD participants reported similar self-rated swallow function as healthy controls, and swallow deficits were correlated with sensory function suggesting an association between impaired sensory function and poor self-awareness of swallow deficits in PD. Conclusions: These results suggest that control of swallow is influenced by airway somatosensory function, that swallow-related deficits in PD are related to abnormal somatosensation, and that swallow and airway sensory function may degrade as a function of disease severity. Therefore, the basal ganglia and related neural networks may play an important role to integrate airway sensory input for swallow-related motor control. Furthermore, the airway deficits observed in PD suggest a disintegration of swallow-related sensory and motor control.",0,0
24334963,Correlation between nasal anatomy and objective obstructive sleep apnea severity,"Objectives: To determine if a correlation exists between nasal anatomical obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea severity as measured by overnight polysomnogram (PSG). Study design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Tertiary medical center. Subjects and methods: Subjects were recruited immediately prior to an overnight, in-lab PSG. All subjects who agreed to participate underwent a standardized nasal examination performed by the senior author and then completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) questionnaire, the Snore Outcomes Survey (SOS), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) prior to their sleep study. In addition, tonsil size, Mallampati score, Friedman tongue position, neck circumference, uvula length, and occlusion were assessed and documented. Nasal anatomy assessments were then compared with PSG, NOSE, SOS, and ESS results. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparisons. Results: One hundred subjects were included in the study. Fifty-nine subjects (59%) were found to have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) (mean apnea-hypopnea index, 13.1; range, 0-64). Severity of OSAS was associated with age (Spearman's ρ = 0.386, P = .0001). No single nasal anatomy measurement or combined nasal anatomy index was found to correlate with objective sleep-disordered breathing severity measured by PSG. The sample size should have provided 90% power to detect a significant correlation if one existed. After accounting for multiple comparisons, turbinate hypertrophy was found to correlate with the NOSE score (0.3577, P = .0305 corrected), and external and internal nasal valve collapse correlated with each other (0.4986, P < .0001 corrected). Conclusions: Objectively assessed abnormal nasal anatomy was not found to be significantly correlated with PSG-measured OSAS severity. Specific objective measurements of obstructive nasal anatomy were correlated to subjective measures of nasal obstruction.",0,0
3407866,Successful difficult intubation. Use of the gum elastic bougie,The reliability of two signs of tracheal placement of a gum elastic bougie was studied. These signs were clicks (produced as the tip of the bougie runs over the tracheal cartilages) and hold up of the bougie as it is advanced (when the tip reaches the small bronchi). Ninety-eight simulated and two genuine Grade 3 difficult intubations were attempted with the aid of a gum elastic bougie. Seventy-eight tracheal and 22 oesophageal placements of the bougie resulted. No clicks or hold up occurred with the bougie in the oesophagus. Clicks were recorded in 89.7% of tracheal placements of the bougie. Hold up at between 24-40 cm occurred in all tracheal placements. We conclude that these signs are reliable and that they should be taught as part of any difficult intubation drill in which the gum elastic bougie is used.,0,0
18712321,[Laryngeal mask LMA Supreme. Application by medical personnel inexperienced in airway management],"Background: The Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme (LMA-S) is a new disposable airway device that combines features of the LMA ProSeal (PLMA, gastric access) and LMA Fastrach (curved shaft to ease insertion) and has been available since April 2007. Methods: In a prospective study, 10 final year medical students or first year anesthesia residents, all with limited experience in LMA anesthesia, were requested to manage the airway of anesthetized female patients with the LMA-S size 4, who seemed normal on routine airway examination. Data collection included the success rates and duration for insertion, oropharyngeal leak pressures (OLP), fiber optic position and airway morbidity. Results: A total of 30 patients were enrolled in the study. Insertion of the LMA-S was possible in 27 (90%) patients at the first attempt and in 3 (10%) at the second attempt. Ventilation was established in 18.3 s (range 10-30 s, standard deviation +/-4.2 s). Insertion of a gastric tube was possible in all patients at the first attempt. Mean OLP at the level of 60 cmH2O cuff pressure was 29.1 cmH2O (range 21-35 cmH2O, standard deviation +/-4.8 cmH2O). Laryngeal fit evaluated by fiber optic control was rated as optimal in all patients both immediately after insertion of the LMA-S and after end of surgery. Three patients (10%) complained of mild sore throat. No patient reported dysphagia or dysphonia. Conclusion: Insertion of the LMA-S was successful and possible in all patients in < or = 30 s with an optimal laryngeal fit, high OLPs and low airway morbidity. The LMA-S seems to be a device suitable for use in routine anesthesia and which can be safely used by medical personnel with limited clinical experience.",0,0
10793598,Effect of cricoid pressure on insertion of and ventilation through the cuffed oropharyngeal airway,"We have assessed the effect of cricoid pressure on insertion of and ventilation through the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) in 53 patients, in a double-blind, randomized study. Two anaesthetists assessed adequacy of ventilation in anaesthetized and paralysed patients at the same time but using different methods. The first assessed ventilation clinically, by observing synchronized chest expansion with gentle manual ventilation and the second noted measurements of tidal volume (VT) and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). Five mask ventilated breaths ('baseline') were assessed as above. Patients were then allocated randomly to receive cricoid pressure (group A, n = 28) or no cricoid pressure (group B, n = 25). Five further mask ventilated breaths ('after manoeuvre') were again assessed. A COPA was then inserted and five further breaths ('after COPA') were assessed. A COPA was inserted at the first attempt in all patients except for one in group A who required two attempts. COPA placement was difficult in one patient in group B who had a small distance between the incisor teeth. Ventilation was clinically 'adequate' in all patients except for one in the cricoid pressure group. There were no significant differences in measured VT or PIP between 'baseline' and 'after manoeuvre' breaths. Significant differences in VT and PIP were found after COPA insertion in the group that received cricoid pressure, with a mean decrease in VT of 108 ml (P = 0.0049) and a mean increase in PIP of 5.2 cm H2O (P = 0.0111).",0,0
18561872,Disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis as a predictor of difficult intubation?,"Background and objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong systemic disease that can affect any joint with a synovium. Managing intubation in patients with rheumatoid disease is a special challenge in these patients especially if specific joints, which play an important role during intubation, are affected. We aimed to investigate if there was a correlation between the activity and duration of the disease and the commonly used predictors of difficult intubation in rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Sixty-six patients with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and 60 control patients were included in the study. Patient characteristics were recorded. Body mass index, disease activity scores, Mallampati classification, sternomental distance, thyromental distance, inter-incisor distance and atlanto-occipital joint extension were measured for each patient. Every patient was asked to complete the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ score). Disease activity score (DAS 28 score) including 28 joints was used to assess the activity of the disease. Correlation between the predictors of difficult intubation and activity was assessed and was compared with the control group. Results: Mallampati scores were higher (P = 0.000), sternomental distance (P = 0.005) and inter-incisor distance (P = 0.003) were shorter and also occlusal surfacetragus line angle were smaller in the rheumatoid arthritis group compared with controls (P = 0.000). We did not observe a correlation between the disease activity scores and the Mallampati score (P = 0.619), sternomental distance (P = 0.195), thyromental distance (P = 0.174), inter-incisor distance (P = 0.764), angle I (P = 0.372) and angle II (P = 0.609). There was no correlation between the HAQ score and the Mallampati score (P = 0.872), sternomental distance (P = 0.455), thyromental distance (P = 0.841), inter-incisor distance (P = 0.162), angle I (P = 0.768) and angle II (P = 0.287). There was no correlation between the duration of the disease and the Mallampati score (P = 0.619), sternomental distance (P = 0.505), thyromental distance (P = 0.426), inter-incisor distance (P = 0.813), angle I (P = 0.377) and angle II (P = 0.600). Conclusion: Tests of disease activity and the duration of the disease were not found to be correlated with the predictors of difficult intubation in this study. Thus, performing the predictive tests for difficult intubation especially in patients with very low scores or short disease is recommended.",0,0
25724584,[Does ultrasonographic volume of the thyroid gland correlate with difficult intubation? An observational study],"Background and objectives: Preoperative ultrasonographic evaluation of the thyroid gland done by surgeons could let us foresee airway management challenges. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effects of thyroid-related parameters assessed preoperatively by surgeons via ultrasonography and chest X-ray on intubation conditions. Methods: Fifty patients undergoing thyroid surgery were enrolled. Thyromental distance, Mallampati score, neck circumference and range of neck movement were evaluated before the operation. Thyroid volume, signs of invasion or compression and tracheal deviation on chest X-ray were also noted. The intubation conditions were assessed with Cormack and Lehane score and the intubation difficulty scale. Statistical analyses were done with SPSS 15.0 software. Results: The mean thyroid volume of the patients was 26.38±14mL. The median intubation difficulty scale was 1 (0-2). Thyromental distance (p=0.011; r=0.36; 95% CI 0.582-0.088), Mallampati score (p=0.041; r=0.29; 95% CI 0.013-0.526), compression or invasion signs (p=0.041; r=0.28; 95% CI 0.006-0.521) and tracheal deviation on chest X-ray (p=0.041; r=0.52; 95% CI 0.268-0.702) were correlated with intubation difficulty scale. Also patients were classified into two groups related to their intubation difficulty scale (Group I, n=19: intubation difficulty scale=0; Group II, n=31: 1<intubation difficulty scale≤5) and difficult intubation predictors and thyroid-related parameters were compared. Only Mallampati score was significantly different between groups (p=0.025). Conclusion: The thyroid volume is not associated with difficult intubation. However clinical assessment parameters may predict difficult intubation.",0,0
9893911,[The importance of the laryngeal mask in the difficult intubation and early experience with the intubating laryngeal mask airway--ILMA--Fastrach],"The conventional laryngeal mask airway (""Standard"" laryngeal mask airway SLMA is of outstanding importance in the management of the difficult airway. The intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach) has become available recently. First results indicate that the excellent ventilation characteristics of SLMA are maintained, but in addition blind intubation is successful in more than 90% of patients with normal anatomy as well as with difficult intubation. Purpose: We present the use of ILMA, compare the potential of the two laryngeal mask types in difficult intubation by own results, present the results of a first symposium on the ILMA held at Jersey in December 1996, the role of the SLMA in difficult intubation as proposed by the American and the French Societies of Anaesthesiology, as well as an outlook on possible uses of the ILMA in the light of the available results. Methods: The SLMA was prospectively used between 1992 and 1997 for 66 operations in 55 patients with difficult intubation (laryngoscopic view Cormack grade IV, n = 24; grade III, n = 35; grade < III, n = 7). 48 operations were performed after resection of a facial carcinoma, 14 on patients without carcinoma who could not be intubated conventionally, 5 on patients with periglottic pathology, and on 50 normals. The ILMA was used on 150 patients between 11/1996 and 11/1997, 106 had normal anatomy, 33 were difficult to intubate (Cormack grade IV, n = 12; grade III, n = 21), 24 had a reduced mouth opening of < or = 2.5 cm awake, 14 of these also were difficult to intubate. Results: Ventilation was superior to a face mask (FM): (SLMA: ventilation not sufficient (SaO2 < 90% > 30 sec) with a FM in 22 operations compared to 5 with a SLMA; ILMA: ventilation not sufficient with a FM in 7 operations compared to 3 with an ILMA). Blind intubation through a SLMA had a success rate of 50% and 34% in 50 normals and in 32 operations with difficult intubation after a mean of 2.6 intubation attempts each. The success rate per intubation attempt for the SLMA was 22% in normals and 13% in difficult intubation. Through an ILMA, blind intubation was successful in 92% of normals, 5 of them with immobile spine, in 91% in patients with difficult intubation, and in 83% in patients with reduced mouth opening. The success rate per intubation attempt was 60% in normals, 46% in difficult intubation, and 46% in reduced mouth opening, with a success rate for the first intubation attempt of 57%. This compares favourably with results presented at the Jersey symposium in 554 patients. Conclusion: The ILMA maintains the superb ventilation potential of a SLMA in difficult intubation but doubles the success rate of blind intubation irrespective of anatomical difficulties, with a 50% success rate during the first intubation attempt. Possible uses of the ILMA may be in difficult intubation situations including immobile spine, in cannot ventilate--cannot intubate situations comparable to a SLMA with an improved chance of successful intubation, and perhaps as a device for ventilation and intubation for untrained people. The use of the ILMA can be trained during everyday practice. Expert assessment of successful endotracheal tube position is mandatory.",0,0
14766698,The Callander laryngoscope blade modification is associated with a decreased risk of dental contact,"Purpose: Dental damage may occur with laryngoscopy. The purpose of this study was twofold: to determine whether preoperative examination could predict the risk of contacting the teeth with the laryngoscope and to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified Macintosh blade on reducing dental contact. Methods: Four hundred and eighty-three patients scheduled for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal tube placement were studied prospectively. Features that might predict difficult intubation were assessed preoperatively. Laryngoscopy was performed twice on each patient, once with a regular Macintosh 3 blade and once with a blade in which the flange was partially removed (Callander modification). The distance between the flange of the blade and the upper incisors at glottic exposure was measured. We calculated correlations between individual airway characteristics and the chance of hitting the upper teeth with the regular Macintosh 3 blade and compared the frequencies of contacting the teeth between the two blades. Results: The chance of hitting the upper teeth when using the regular Macintosh 3 blade increased significantly with non-parametric scores for Mallampati classification, mandibular subluxation, head and neck movement, interincisor gap, and condition of the upper teeth. (P < 0.01) The frequency of direct contact varied significantly between the two blades: 20.3% vs 4.1% for Macintosh 3 and modified blades, respectively (P < 0.05). Laryngeal views were improved with the modified blade. Conclusion: Airway characteristics correlate with the risk of hitting the upper teeth during laryngoscopy. The modified Macintosh blade reduces the risk of contacting the teeth.",0,0
25045249,Dexmedetomidine for awake intubation and an opioid-free general anesthesia in a superobese patient with suspected difficult intubation,"Super-obese patients (body mass index [BMI] >50 kg/m(2)) are at a particularly high risk of anesthesia-related complications during postoperative period, eg, critical respiratory events including respiratory arrest, and over-sedation leading to problems with maintaining airway open, hypoxia and hypercapnia. In this paper authors present a case of a 39-year-old super-obese (BMI 62.3 kg/m(2)) female patient who was admitted for surgical treatment of obesity. Preanesthesia evaluation revealed hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) as comorbidities as well as potential for a difficult intubation- neck circumference of 46 cm, reduced neck mobility and DM type 2. Patient was intubated using ""awake intubation"" method using topical anesthesia and dexmedetomidine infusion. General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine infusion instead of opioid administration in ""opioid-free anesthesia method"".",0,0
24904233,Cardiac arrest is a predictor of difficult tracheal intubation independent of operator experience in hospitalized patients,"Background: Placement of advanced airways has been associated with worsened neurologic outcome in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These findings have been attributed to factors such as inexperienced operators, prolonged intubation times and other airway related complications. As an initial step to examine outcomes of advanced airway placement during in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), where immediate assistance and experienced operators are continuously available, we examined whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts affect intubation difficulty. Additionally, we examined whether or not the use of videolaryngoscopy increases the odds of first attempt intubation success compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy. Methods: The study setting is a large urban university-affiliated teaching hospital where experienced airway managers are available to perform emergent intubation for any indication in any out-of-the-operating room location 24 hours a day, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year. Intubations occurring in all adults >18 years-of-age who required emergent tracheal intubation outside of the operating room between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012 were examined retrospectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of difficult intubation during IHCA compared to other emergent non-IHCA indications with adjustment for a priori defined potential confounders (body mass index, operator experience, use of videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy, and age). Results: In adjusted analyses, the odds of difficult intubation were higher when taking place during IHCA (OR=2.63; 95% CI 1.1-6.3, p=0.03) compared to other emergent indications. Use of video versus direct laryngoscopy for initial intubation attempts during IHCA, however, did not improve the odds of success (adjusted OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.35-1.43, p = 0.33). Conclusions: Difficult intubation is more likely when intubation takes place during IHCA compared to other emergent indications, even when experienced operators are available. Under these conditions, direct laryngoscopy (versus videolaryngoscopy) remains a reasonable first choice intubation technique.",0,0
21559793,Xenon anesthesia reduces TNFα and IL10 in bariatric patients,"Background: Anesthesia is able to modulate the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production during surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of three anesthesia approaches, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), inhalation anesthesia, and xenon anesthesia, on sieric levels of nitric oxide (NO), IL6, IL10, and TNFα in obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass. Methods: Thirty adult morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35) scheduled for Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass were randomly recruited and allocated to TIVA (N = 10), inhalation anesthesia (SEV, N = 10), and xenon anesthesia (XE, N = 10). Exclusion criteria were ASA IV, age <18 or >60 years, and Mallampati IV. Opioid dosage and ventilation parameters were standardized. Sieric levels of NO, IL6, IL10, and TNFα were assessed at T0 (before induction of anesthesia), T1 (end of surgery), and T2 (12 h after the end of surgery). We compared the relative cytokine level variations (delta) at T1 and T2 and the cytokine exposure levels calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) between T0 and T2 in the XE and non-XE (SEV + TIVA) groups. Results: At T1, we found a significant ΔIL10 (reduction) and ΔTNFα (reduction) between XE and SEV (p < 0.05) and XE and TIVA (p < 0.05) groups. At T2, ΔIL10 was still significant. Furthermore, we found a reduced AUC value for TNFα in the XE group. Conclusions: Xenon anesthesia seems able to inhibit postoperative proinflammatory cytokine imbalance in morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass; the reduced ΔTNFα at T1 and the reduced global exposition to TNFα in the XE group may explain the reduced ΔIL10 at T1 and T2.",0,0
7818064,Alterations in endotracheal tube position during general anaesthesia,"The effect of head and neck movement and Trendelenburg tilt on endotracheal tube position, relative to the carina, was studied in fifty adult patients requiring intubation for elective surgery. On average, inward movement, that is shortening of the distance between the endotracheal tube tip and the carina, resulted from neck flexion (mean = -5.5 mm), whereas outward movement occurred with neck extension (mean = 6.3 mm). Neck rotation, to right and left, and Trendelenburg tilt did not show any trend towards inward nor outward movement (mean = 0.3 mm/1.7 mm/-0.6 mm, respectively). Whilst these mean positional changes for flexion and extension confirm the findings of earlier investigations, our range of maximum inward and outward displacement for flexion (23 mm in/19 mm out), extension (21 mm in/33 mm out), rotation to right (19 mm in/17 mm out), to left (22 mm in/19 mm out) and Trendelenburg tilt (22 mm in/16 mm out) indicate that for any given postural change in any one patient, the direction and magnitude of endotracheal tube displacement is not readily predictable.",0,0
22754440,"Effects of addition of ketamine, fentanyl and saline with Propofol induction on hemodynamics and laryngeal mask airway insertion conditions in oral clonidine premedicated children","Background: The aim of this double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study was to compare the effect of addition of ketamine; fentanyl and saline with propofol anesthesia on hemodynamic profile and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion conditions in oral clonidine premedicated children. Methods: 180 children (age 2 - 10 years) were at first given oral clonidine (4 μg/kg) 90 minutes before operation, and then were randomly allocated to receive either ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n=60), fentanyl 1 μg/kg (n=60) or 0.9% normal saline (n=60) before induction with propofol 3.0 mg/kg. Insertion of LMA was performed within 1 minute of injection of propofol. Heart rate and mean blood pressure were noted 1 min before induction (baseline), immediately after induction, before and after insertion of LMA for up to 3 min. Following LMA insertion, 6 subjective end points were noted-mouth opening, coughing, swallowing, patient's movement, laryngospasm, and ease of an insertion. LMA insertion summed score was prepared depending upon these variables. Results: LMA insertion summed score was nearly similar in ketamine and fentanyl group, which were significantly better than saline group (P<0.004). Mean blood pressure and heart rate were maintained in ketamine than with fentanyl or saline group. Incidence of prolonged apnea (>120 secs.) was higher in fentanyl group compared to ketamine and saline group. Conclusion: Even in oral clonidine premedicated children, addition of ketamine with propofol provides hemodynamic stability and comparable conditions for LMA insertion like fentanyl propofol with significantly less prolonged apnea.",0,0
24979849,[Preoperative predictive airway procedual factors influencing successful fiberoptic oral intubation under general anesthesia],"Background: Although preoperative airway assessment is important for airway management, preoperative predictive factors influencing successful fiberoptic oral intubation (FOI) have not been well investigated. Here, we assessed the factors for successful FOI. Methods: In 30 adult patients, we assessed gender, age, snoring habit, body mass index, Mallampati classification, upper-lip-bite-tests, and length around necks. First we attempted FOI under general anesthesia in a neutral position. When a gap was observed between the epiglottis and posterior pharyngeal wall, we advanced the instrument into the gap. We added airway procedures without observing the gap until it was visible and intubation successful. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine factors for successful FOI with scores of the factors. Results: Intubation was successful in 0 at neutral position, in 16 at head tilt, in 5 at sniffing position and in the residual 9 at jaw thrust. Snore was the most influencing factor for successful FOI, according to determined linear regression analysis. Conclusions: We require additional airway procedures and assistance to succeed in FOI in patients who snore.",0,0
16756049,An assessment of the ratio of height to thyromental distance compared to thyromental distance as a predictive test for prediction of difficult tracheal intubation in Thai patients,"Background and rationale: Preoperative evaluation is important in the detection of patients at risk for difficult tracheal intubation. Thyromental distance (TMD) is often used for these purposes, but its value as an indicator for difficult intubation is questionable, as it varies with patient size and body proportions. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the accuracies of the ratio of patient's height to TMD (ratio of height to TMD = RHTMD) and TMD alone in the prediction of difficult tracheal intubation in Thai patients. Material and methods: The authors collected data on 382 consecutive patients scheduled to receive general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation for elective surgery. Thyromental distance and RHTMD were evaluated preoperatively. Difficult intubation was defined in the present study by Cormack and Lehane grade 3 or 4. The optimal predictive value was chosen using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of TMD and RHTMD were compared to determine the performance of the different predictive tests used. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of each of the predictive tests were calculated according to standard formulae. Results: Difficult intubation occurred in 42 patients (10.9 %). The predictive advantage of RHTMD has a similar specificity with improved sensitivity in comparison with TMD. The AUC of RHTMD was significantly greater than the AUC of TMD (p = 0.00). The authors concluded that RHTMD had better accuracy in predicting difficult intubation than TMD.",1,1
26169808,"Observational study of sleep, respiratory mechanics and quality of life in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: a protocol study","Introduction: Bronchiectasis is a chronic disorder characterised by permanent and irreversible abnormal dilation of the bronchi and bronchioles, primarily caused by repeated cycles of pulmonary infections and inflammation, which lead to reduced mucociliary clearance and to the excessive production of sputum. Patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis may be predisposed to hypoxemia during sleep, or to symptoms that may lead to arousals and thereby reduce the quality of life, because of the irreversible dilation of the bronchi and the presence of secretions and airflow obstruction. Methods and analysis: For this cross-sectional observational study, patients with a clinical diagnosis of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis will be recruited from the Bronchiectasis Clinic of the Pneumology Department of the Santa Casa de Misericordia Hospital and the Federal University of São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil). Patients of either sex will be included if high-resolution CT of the thorax and classic sweat test confirms they have non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, are between 18 and 80 years old, use long-acting bronchodilators, are clinically stable for a least 1 month, agree to participate in the study and they sign a statement of informed consent. The first part of the study will involve a clinical evaluation, maximal respiratory pressures, spirometry and the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire. The Sleep Laboratory of the Master's and Doctoral Postgraduate Program in Rehabilitation Sciences of the Nove de Julho University (São Paulo, Brazil) will perform the polysomnographic studies, Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, waist and neck circumferences, modified Mallampati classification and tonsil index.

21557233,Selection and placement of oral ventilation tubes based on tracheal morphometry,"Objective/hypothesis: Evidence-based guidelines for the selection of appropriately sized ventilation tubes as well as their placement do not exist, although iatrogenic injuries to the trachea and larynx following endotracheal intubation are not infrequent. Our objective was to provide selection recommendations for ventilation tubes based on anatomic criteria. Study design: Prospective cross-sectional study at a tertiary care hospital. Methods: From January 2010 to June 2010 all patients more than 16 years who underwent computer tomography of the neck were included. Contraindications were intubation, tracheotomy, fractures of the lower jaw, tumors, and head or neck deformities. Radiologic data was used to determine the distance between the lower incisors and cricoid cartilage and the smallest laryngotracheal diameter. The results were correlated with patient characteristics and compared with properties of ventilation tubes. Results: One hundred fifty-nine patients were included in the study. The laryngotracheal constriction was subcricoidal with a mean diameter of 15.5 ± 3.2 mm coronal and 17.1 ± 2.6 mm sagittal. The mean distance between lower incisors and cricoid cartilage was 176.5 ± 14.8 mm. Patient height correlated significantly with the coronal subcricoid tracheal diameter (r = .51; P < .001) as well as with the distance between lower incisors and cricoid cartilage (r = .64; P < .001). No statistically significant gender or age-related correlations were found. Despite having the same specifications, tubes from different manufacturers differed considerably in their dimensions. Conclusions: Selection of size and placement of ventilation tubes can be based on patient height. Considerable differences in the dimensions of ventilation tubes necessitate a height-based nomogram for evidence-based tube selection and placement. A uniform system of tube labeling based on biometric data is required.",0,0
18931222,A rapidly enlarging neck mass: the role of the sitting position in fiberoptic bronchoscopy for difficult intubation,"Difficult airway management is a dilemma for any anesthesiologist. Although practice guidelines and algorithms may help in such situations, the anesthesiologist's judgment and vigilance remain the primary means to save lives. In the following case, we encountered an acutely enlarging thyroid mass that was compromising the airway. This huge neck mass precluded tracheostomy under local anesthesia, and the patient could breathe only in the sitting position. Therefore, there were few safe strategies for airway management for general anesthesia. We reiterate the role of awake fiberoptic intubation in such circumstances.",0,0
20422847,[Comparison of the view of the glottic opening through Macintosh and AirTraq laryngoscopes in patients undergoing scheduled surgery],"Background and objective: The AirTraq laryngoscope is a new intubation device that may provide better viewing conditions than can be achieved with the traditional Macintosh device. This study compared the AirTraq and Macintosh views and assessed whether predictors of intubation difficulty are useful when the AirTraq laryngoscope is used. Material and methods: Prospective study of 215 ASA 1-3 patients over the age of 18 years who were to receive anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Excluded were patients who required emergency surgery, who had a history of difficult intubation, or for whom ventilation was difficult during induction of anesthesia. In addition to the usual patient characteristics, we recorded thyromental distance, mouth opening, and Mallampati score. The Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy grade was recorded for each device. A Cormack-Lehane grade of 1 or 2 was considered a good view. A grade of 3 or 4 was considered a poor view. The McNemar test was used to compare laryngoscopy grade between the 2 devices in each patient. The chi2 test was used to compare predictors of intubation difficulty. Results: The Macintosh laryngoscope achieved a Cormack-Lehane grade of 1 in 653% of the patients, of 2 in 22.4%, of 3 in 11.3%, and of 4 in 1.4%. The AirTraq scope gave a Cormack-Lehane grade of 1 in 96.2%, of 2 in 33%, of 3 in 0.5%, and of 4 in 0%. The differences were statistically significant. None of the predictors was associated a poor glottic view through the AirTraq device. Conclusions: Poor viewing conditions occurred less frequently when the AirTraq device was used. Intubation conditions were therefore better with the AirTraq than with the Macintosh device. The traditional predictors of difficult intubation do not seem to be relevant when the AirTraq device is to be used.",0,0
7565418,Airway protection by the laryngeal mask airway in children,"The pediatric laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a scale-down version of the adult form, and no direct postmortem specimen work has been performed so far. There are several anatomical differences between pediatric and adult airways, and hence, the scale-down version of the adult LMA is not necessarily water-tight in pediatric patients. We performed a prospective study to assess airway protection by the LMA in pediatric patients, using methylence blue (injected in the pharynx outside the LMA) and the fibreoptic bronchoscope to view the inside of the mask, to detect any leakage of the dye. Fifty Patients (40 boys and 10 girls) aged 1-10 years (mean 4.5 yr) were studied. All patients underwent surgery below the level of the umbilicus, under light general anesthesia combined with caudal epidural block. All patients were allowed to breath spontaneously over an Ayre's T-piece. Dye staining of the inside of the mask was detected in 5 patients (10%). The esophageal opening was visualized within the mask in 3 patients (6%). No serious complications occurred in any of our patients.",0,0
6614426,"[Difficult intubation in Pierre-Robin children, a new method: the retromolar route]","The Pierre-Robin-children show a micro- and retrognathia of the lower jaw with the consequence of dorsal and cranial displacement of the basioglossal. It is well known that this can lead to serious difficulties in endotracheal intubation. As far as we know intubation via retromolar route has never been described at length. It has never been mentioned in the case of Pierre-Robin-children as an alternative to the unsuccessful classical method. This paper describes the problems intubation in these children and deals with the corresponding prophylactic measures of most importance before intubating. It describes in detail the technique of homolateral retromolar intubation - axis straight and distance shorter - and gives helpful guidelines that lead to a straight intubation axis in spite of anatomical abnormalities: pressure on the cricoid, pushing the larynx to the side, hyperextending, adjusting the degree of flexion, pushing or rotating the head to the other side or appropriate bending the end of the tube with a stylet.",0,0
22973524,Use of the Bonfils Intubation Fiberscope in patients with limited mouth opening,"Airway management of patients with very limited mouth opening remains a challenge for the anaesthetist. We describe the use of the Bonfils Intubation Fiberscope for awake intubation in two patients with a very limited mouth opening. In the first case, a 60-year-old 80 kg female, scheduled for a right modified radical mastectomy for infiltrating ductal carcinoma (15 mm mouth opening, a short thick neck, limited neck extension, and a Mallampati class 4 airway), the Bonfils was advanced via the retromolar technique. In the second patient, a 34-year-old male, scheduled for a surgical tracheotomy for right tonsillar cancer, due to a neoplastic infiltration of the right temporomandibular joint (7 mm mouth opening and limited neck movement), the Bonfils was advanced using the midline approach. The Bonfils is a reusable, rigid, straight fiberoptic device with a curved tip, is 5 mm in diameter, and has several advantages: it is quick and easy to use, more cost effective than a flexible fiberscope, and is safe in expert hands, thanks to its smaller diameter. Our conclusion is that awake BIF intubation is a reliable, atraumatic, and well-tolerated procedure to secure a safe airway in patients with a limited mouth opening.",0,0
12066730,The proseal laryngeal mask: results of a descriptive trial with experience of 300 cases,"Background: The ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) is a new laryngeal mask device with a modified cuff and a drainage tube. Methods: We assessed the PLMA in 300 anaesthetized adults either paralysed or breathing spontaneously. We assessed insertion characteristics, airway seal pressures, haemodynamic response to insertion, ease of gastric tube placement, gastric insufflation, and postoperative sore throat. Results: Insertion was successful in 294 patients (98%) and graded as easy in 274 patients (91%). We found no difference in ease of insertion or success rate with either the introducer or the finger insertion method, or in paralysed or non-paralysed patients. Mean airway seal pressure was 29 cm H2O, and 59 patients (20%) had seal pressures greater than 40 cm H2O. No gastric insufflation was detected. Gastric tube placement was successful in 290 of 294 patients (98.6%). There was no cardiovascular response to insertion, with a small reduction in heart rate 5 min after insertion and significant decreases in mean arterial pressure at 1 and 5 min after insertion. Sore throat was noted in 23% patients after operation and in 16% of patients after 24 h, with 90% of the sore throats described as mild. Conclusions: The PLMA is a reliable airway management device that can give an effective glottic seal in paralysed and non-paralysed patients. The device allows the easy passage of a gastric tube, causes a minimal haemodynamic response to insertion, and an acceptable incidence of sore throat.",0,0
12797610,Tracheobronchomalacia: evolving role of dynamic multislice helical CT,"Paired inspiratory and dynamic expiratory multislice CT imaging is a promising method for diagnosing TBM. A low-dose technique should be considered for the dynamic portion to reduce radiation exposure. Visual and quantitative analysis of the central airways provide a comprehensive assessment by allowing for the accurate diagnosis of TBM, determining its extent, assessing for predisposing conditions, and aiding selection of candidates for stent placement or tracheoplasty procedures. This technique can also be helpful for assessing response of airway dynamics following therapeutic intervention.",0,0
10451134,"Predictive models for difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. A clinical, radiologic and three-dimensional computer imaging study","Purpose: To identify the variables most useful in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation from various clinical, skeletal (lateral x-rays) and soft tissue (three-dimensional computed tomography imaging) measurements. Methods: Twenty-four adult patients in whom an unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation was identified according to established criteria were evaluated. Further, a control group of 32 patients in whom tracheal intubation was easily accomplished was studied. We applied multivariate discriminant analysis to clinical and radiological data of all patients to select those variables most useful in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to describe the discrimination abilities and to explore the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity of the model. Results: With the clinical data alone, discriminant analysis identified four risk factors that correlated with the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation: thyrosternal distance, thyromental distance, neck circumference and Mallampati classification. With both clinical and radiological data, discriminant analysis identified five risk factors: thyrosternal distance, thyromental distance, Mallampati classification, depth of spine C2 and angle A (the most antero-inferior point of the upper central incisor tooth). The positive predictive value of this combined (clinical and radiological) model was greater than that of the clinical model alone (95.8% vs 87.5%, respectively). The areas under the ROC curves, that measure the probability of the correct prediction of the clinical and the combined models, were found to be 0.933 and 0.973, respectively. Conclusions: These models can be used for predicting difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in clinical practice.",1,1

A 19-year-old female with Rett syndrome underwent ophthalmologic surgery under general anesthesia at our institution. Airway control was difficult due to her limited mouth opening. We recommend that anesthesiologists should have proper knowledge about this disease and the patients to avoid the complications and problems that can be encountered during the perioperative period.",0,0
7675274,[General anesthesia in Cohen syndrome. Report of a clinical case],"The case of a 23 years old woman, affected by the Cohen syndrome, who underwent general anesthesia for extensive dental surgery, is reported. The Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome that causes mental retardation, obesity, short stature as well as oral, ocular, and limb anomalies. The problems the anesthesiologist could deal with include the capacity of the patient to cooperate; difficult intubation because of maxillary hypoplasia, micrognathia, narrow and high-arched palate, and prominent maxillary central incisors; generalized muscular hypotonia; moderate leukopenia, that could theoretically increase the risk of infection: and, finally, possible associated mitral valve prolapse or hiatus hernia. In the case reported the presence of mitral valve prolapse or hiatus hernia was ruled out echographically. The patient was premedicated with diazepam and atropine i.m.; general anesthesia was carried out by propofol-fentanyl association and myorelaxation was obtained with atracurium. Nasotracheal intubation was performed easily in spite of oral anomalies so that the usefulness of thyromental distance, which was 7 cm long, as a clinical test to evaluate a potentially difficult intubation was confirmed. Noteworthy, the thyromental distance was the only test which was suitable for the uncooperative patient. At the end of surgery muscular tone recovered promptly and the endotracheal tube could be regularly removed. No complication was registered postoperatively.",0,0
16704593,Evaluation of four airway training manikins as simulators for inserting the LMA Classic*,"Airway manikins have traditionally been used for teaching mask ventilation and tracheal intubation. There is an increasing need to use manikins for training in procedures such as insertion of the laryngeal mask airway. We have assessed four new airway training manikins (latest versions of the Airway Trainer (Laerdal, Norway), Airway Management Trainer (Ambu, UK), 'Bill 1' (VBM, Germany) and Airsim (Trucorp, Ireland)) as simulators for insertion of the LMA Classic laryngeal mask airway. Twenty volunteer anaesthetists inserted a size-4 laryngeal mask airway five times into each of the four manikins, in random order. Each insertion was assessed using objective and subjective tests. Subjective assessment varied widely but overall assessment indicated that the Airway Management Trainer was the poorest simulator for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway. The 'Bill 1' and Airsim manikins performed best as simulators for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway, although realistic ventilation with 'Bill 1' was not possible.",0,0
8386107,Increased LTB4 metabolites and PGD2 in BAL fluid after methacholine challenge in asthmatic subjects,"The bronchoconstrictor potency of inhaled methacholine is widely used to assess airway responsiveness. However, evidence has accumulated that methacholine inhalation challenge may lead to an inflammatory response in the lower respiratory tract. We therefore compared cellular, leukotriene and prostanoid profiles in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) obtained five hours after methacholine challenge to control lavages without prior challenge. Eight subjects with asymptomatic to mild bronchial asthma and nine nonatopic healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Without prior challenge, the percentage of BAL eosinophils was higher in the asthmatic subjects ((mean +/- SD), 1.1 +/- 0.9%) than in the control subjects (0.1 +/- 0.1%. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and its omega-oxidation products (20-OH-LTB4 and 20-COOH-LTB4) were the only leukotrienes detectable in the baseline BAL fluids in five of the eight asthmatic patients. After methacholine challenge, no change in BAL cell profile occurred, but in the asthmatic patients, the total amounts of LTB4 and its omega-oxidation products rose from 0.52 +/- 0.50 ng.ml-1 (pre-challenge) to 1.55 +/- 1.32 ng.ml-1 (post-challenge), and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) rose from 49.1 +/- 15.7 (pre-challenge) to 94.4 +/- 25.4 pg.ml-1 (post-challenge), with no change in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and prostaglandins F2 alpha and E2 (PGF2 alpha and PGE2). In the healthy controls, no consistent change in BAL cell profile and mediators occurred after methacholine provocation. We conclude that inhaled methacholine stimulates LTB4 and PGD2 release in asthmatics, but not in healthy controls, without affecting the number of inflammatory cells in BAL fluid.",0,0
1904206,A single-blind study of combined pulse oximetry and capnography in children,"This single-blind study examined four levels of monitoring in 402 pediatric cases. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) oximeter and capnograph; 2) only oximeter; 3) only capnograph; or 4) neither oximeter nor capnograph data available to the anesthesia team. An anesthesiologist, not involved in patient care, observed all cases and continuously recorded hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Spo2), ECG, expired CO2, and the oximeter plethysmographic output. Mean age, weight, ASA physical status, airway management (mask or endotracheal tube), and anesthetic technique were similar in each group. Two-hundred sixty problems were documented in 153 patients. Fifty-nine events in 43 patients resulted in ""major"" desaturation (Spo2 less than or equal to 85% for greater than or equal to 30 s). Fifteen ""major"" capnograph events (esophageal intubation, disconnection, accidental extubation, or obstructed endotracheal tube) were observed in 11 patients; 8 of these also developed varying degrees of desaturation. One-hundred thirty ""minor"" desaturation events (Spo2 less than or equal to 95% for greater than 60 s) and 79 ""minor"" desaturation events (hypercarbaria or hypocarbia) were observed. A number of problems fulfilled criteria in multiple categories. Infants less than or equal to 6 months of age had the highest incidence of major desaturation events (18 of 65 [27%]) compared to toddlers 7-24 months of age or children greater than 24 months of age (P less than 0.001). Blinding the oximeter data increased the number of patients (12 vs. 31) experiencing major desaturation events (P = 0.003); blinding the capnograph data altered neither the frequency of desaturation events nor the incidence of major capnograph events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
23327031,"Comparative study between I-gel, a new supraglottic airway device, and classical laryngeal mask airway in anesthetized spontaneously ventilated patients","Objective: To compare two different supraglottic airway devices, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and the I-gel, regarding easiness of insertion of the device, leak pressure, gastric insufflation, end tidal CO2, oxygen saturation, hemodynamic and postoperative complications in anesthetized, spontaneously ventilated adult patients performing different non-emergency surgical procedures. Materials and methods: The study was carried out as a prospective, randomized, clinical trial among 80 patients who underwent different surgical procedures under general anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation in supine position. They were equally randomized into two groups: I-gel and LMA groups. Both the devices were compared with regard to heart rate, arterial BP, SPO2, end-tidal CO2, number and duration of insertion attempts, incidence of gastric insufflation, leak pressure and airway assessment after removal of the device. Results: No statistically significant difference was reported between both the groups, regarding heart rate, arterial BP, SPO2 and end-tidal CO2. The mean duration of insertion attempts was 15.6 +/- 4.9 seconds in the I-gel group, while it was 26.2 +/- 17.7 seconds in the LMA group. The difference between both the groups regarding duration of insertion attempts was statistically significant (P 0.0023*), while the number of insertion attempts was statistically insignificant between both the study groups (P > 0.05). Leak pressure was(25.6 +/- 4.9 versus 21.2 +/- 7.7 0.016* cmH2O) significantly higher among studied patients of the I-gel group and incidence of gastric insufflation was significantly more with LMA 9 (22.5%) versus 2 (5%) 0.016* in I-gel group. Conclusion: Both LMA and I-gel do not cause any significant alteration in the hemodynamic status of the patients, end tidal CO2, and SPO2. The postoperative complications were not significantly different except nusea and vomiting was statistically significant higher in LMAgroup(P 0.032). among both LMA and I-gel patients. Insertion of I-gel was significantly easier and more rapid than insertion of LMA. Leak pressure was significantly higher with I-gel than LMA and thus incidence of gastric insufflation was significantly lower with I-gel.",0,0
25271178,Assessment of emergency airway management techniques in Korea using an online registration system: a multicenter study,"Background: The investigators developed a Web-based online registration system to identify the current status of trauma airway management. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to identify first-pass success (FPS) rate of the intubation methods and devices that are currently used, as well as the factors that affect FPS in trauma patients. Methods: This study was designed as a prospective, observational multi-center study. We obtained clinical data of intubated trauma patients in 13 academic emergency departments in Korea. After performing an intubation, each patient's data were entered into a Web-based registry. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors that affect FPS. Results: The FPS rate was 80.6% in all trauma patients. The curved-blade laryngoscope was the most commonly used instrument, and was applied to 1395 patients (76.2%) during first attempt. Video laryngoscopy was applied to 341 patients (18.6%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, factors that affected FPS in difficult airway trauma patients were emergency physicians, senior physicians, and video laryngoscopy (odds ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.04-5.65; 1.80, 1.16-2.79; and 2.16, 1.39-3.33, respectively). Conclusions: Emergency physicians in Korea are prepared for trauma patient airway management.

16481801,Objective sizing of upper airway stenosis: a quantitative endoscopic approach,"Objective: In patients with airway stenosis, anatomy of the lesion determines the magnitude of the biomechanical ventilatory disturbance and thus the nature and severity of symptoms. It also gives information about biology, likelihood of response to treatment, and prognosis of laryngotracheal lesions. Accurate airway sizing throughout treatment is therefore central to managing this condition. We developed a method for objective assessment of airway lesions during endoscopy. Methods: We used airway simulations to investigate the effects of endoscope tilt and lens distortions on measurement accuracy, devising and validating clinical rules for quantitative airway endoscopy. A calibrator was designed to assess lesion length, location, and cross-section during tracheoscopy. Results: It proved possible to calculate the length and location of the stenosis using simple mathematics. Cross-section measurements were more than 95% accurate, independent of endoscope tilt and without making assumptions about endoscope optics and visuospatial distortion, for both pediatric and adult airway dimensions. The technique was used to characterize airway lesions in 10 adult patients with an average age of 48 years undergoing therapeutic laryngotracheoscopy. Lesions occurred on average 36 mm below the glottis (range, 21-54 mm) and were 9.3 mm long (5-17 mm). The average pretreatment airway cross-section was 48.3 mm, increasing to 141.1 mm after laser therapy. Two independent observers calculated airway cross-sections, achieving an interobserver concordance of 0.98. Conclusions: This method can be used to objectively and precisely determine the anatomy of airway lesions, allowing accurate documentation of lesion characteristics and surgical results, serial monitoring throughout treatment, and comparison of outcomes between different centers.",0,0
22210063,Admission chest CT complements fiberoptic bronchoscopy in prediction of adverse outcomes in thermally injured patients,"In burned patients, inhalation injury can result in progressive pulmonary dysfunction, infection, and death. Although bronchoscopy is the standard for diagnosis, it only assesses the proximal airway and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of pulmonary insult. Chest radiographs have not been proven helpful in diagnosis of inhalation injury. Our hypothesis is that a CT scan alone or in conjunction with bronchoscopy can be used as a prognostic tool for critically ill burn patients, especially those with inhalation injury. The authors performed a retrospective study of all patients admitted to the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center between 2002 and 2008 with chest CT within 24 hours of admission. They divided subjects into two groups, those with evidence of inhalation injury on bronchoscopy and those without. They used a radiologist's score to assess the degree of damage to the pulmonary parenchyma. The primary endpoint was a composite of pneumonia, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. The inhalation injury group consisted of 25 patients and the noninhalation injury group of 19 patients. Groups were not different in age, TBSA burned, and percentage full-thickness burn. By multiple logistic regression, detection of inhalation injury on bronchoscopy was associated with an 8.3-fold increase in the composite endpoint. The combination of inhalation injury on bronchoscopy and a high radiologist's score was associated with a 12.7-fold increase in the incidence of the composite endpoint. Admission CT assists in predicting future lung dysfunction in burn patients.",0,0
24639838,Is ultrasonic investigation of transverse tracheal air shadow diameter reasonable for evaluation of difficult airway in pregnant women: A prospective comparative study,"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare clinical screening tests (modified Mallampati score, Cormack-Lehane score, thyromental distance, and sternomental distance) with ultrasonic measurements of the upper airway in predicting difficult intubation in pregnant women whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is higher and lower than 30 kg m-2. Methods: This study was designed as a prospective observational trial, and consisted of 40 pregnant women of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1-2 groups. Patients with a BMI lower than 30 kg m-2 were included in Group 1 (n=20), and patients with a BMI higher than 30 kg m-2 were included in Group 2 (n=20). In the supine position with head in mild extension, the diameter of the transverse tracheal air shadow in the subglottic area of the front neck was measured using ultrasonography. Modified Mallampati score, Cormack-Lehane score, thyromental distance and sternomental distance measurements were recorded. Results: No statistically significant difference was detected between groups regarding mean age, mean number of pregnancy, ASA scores and comorbid disease. Mean body weight (p=0.0001) and mean pre-pregnancy weight (p=0.0001) were significantly higher in Group 2. There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding mean modified Mallampati score, thyromental distance, sternomental distance measurements, Cormack-Lehane score, and mean ultrasonic measurements. Conclusion: It was found that BMI higher or lower than 30 kg m-2 has no effect on ultrasonic measurements and clinical airway tests. We thought that ultrasonic measurement could not give us valuable information in obese or non-obese pregnant women.",0,0
15165297,Inhaled bronchodilator administration during mechanical ventilation,"Inhaled bronchodilators are routinely administered to mechanically ventilated patients to relieve dyspnea and reverse bronchoconstriction. A lower percentage of the nominal dose reaches the lower respiratory tract in a mechanically ventilated patient than in a nonintubated subject, but attention to device selection, administration technique, dosing, and patient-ventilator interface can increase lower-respiratory-tract deposition in a mechanically ventilated patient. Assessing the airway response to bronchodilator by measuring airway resistance and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure helps guide dosing and timing of drug delivery. Selecting the optimal aerosol-generating device for a mechanically ventilated patient requires consideration of the ease, reliability, efficacy, safety, and cost of administration. With careful attention to administration technique, bronchodilator via metered-dose inhaler or nebulizer can be safe and effective with mechanically ventilated patients.",0,0
19448202,The efficacy of the Storz Miller 1 video laryngoscope in a simulated infant difficult intubation,"Background: Several studies have shown video laryngoscopy to be a useful technique in the management of patients in whom glottic exposure by direct laryngoscopy is difficult. We conducted this study as a preliminary investigation comparing the Storz DCI Miller 1 video laryngoscope (VL, Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) and direct laryngoscopy with a Miller 1 laryngoscope (DL) in an infant manikin model simulating difficult direct laryngoscopy. We hypothesized that compared with DL, VL would provide a better glottic view but would be associated with a longer time to intubation because of the different skill set required when using video intubation. Methods: A Laerdal infant airway management training manikin (Laerdal Medical, Wappingers Falls, NY) was adapted using cloth tape to limit cervical spine mobility. Thirty-two attending pediatric anesthesiologists attempted tracheal intubation of the infant manikin using VL and DL in randomized order. The best laryngeal view with each laryngoscope and time to intubation were documented. Results: There was a significant difference in the distributions of laryngoscopy grades between VL and DL (P < 0.001), with the VL giving a better laryngeal view. Forty percent of anesthesiologists reported a Grade 3 or 4 view with DL; all of which were converted to Grades 1 and 2 with VL. The median grade with interquartile range was two (2-3) for DL and one (1-2) for VL (P < 0.001). Seventy-eight percent of participants reported an improvement of at least one grade in laryngeal view with VL compared with DL. There were two failed intubations using DL and none using VL. Time to intubation was similar between the two techniques. Conclusions: The Storz Miller 1 VL blade improved glottic exposure in a simulated difficult laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy with a standard Miller 1 blade without increasing the time to intubation.",0,0
18362772,Predictors of difficult intubation in patients with cervical spine limitations,"Background: Cervical spine function is of paramount importance to the management of the airway. What has not been reported in the literature is a systematic analysis of airway management in patients with cervical spine limitation (CSL) compared with their normal counterparts or a predictive model of difficult intubation (DI) in patients with CSL. Methods: We reviewed the electronic charts of 14,053 patients and identified those with CSL based on the preoperative airway evaluation. We then compared various airway parameters in patients with CSL to those without CSL and further assessed risk factors for DI in patients with CSL. We develop a predictive model on the basis of multivariate analysis of such risk factors. Results: Of the cohort studied, 1145 or 8.1% of patients were documented as having some form of CSL, with an average age of 60. In the <60 population, CSL was associated with a statistically significant increase in difficult and impossible mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, and DI. In the population > or =60 years old, CSL was associated with a statistically significant increase in difficult laryngoscopy and DI. There were no significant differences in mask ventilation between normal and CSL patients in the population > or =60. Multivariate modeling revealed age > or =48, Mallampati 3 or 4, and thyromental distance <6 cm as independent preoperative risk factors of DI in patients with CSL. A predictive model is developed on the basis of these findings. Conclusions: Limitations of cervical spine mobility are relatively common and increase the incidence of difficulty throughout the spectrum of airway management. DI should be anticipated in CSL patients who are > or =48 years old, have a Mallampati class 3 or 4, and a thyromental distance of <6 cm.",0,0
17000813,Difficult intubation in thyroid surgery: myth or reality?,"Thyroid surgery is considered to be a risk factor for difficult airway management. We prospectively studied 324 consecutive patients undergoing thyroid surgery to investigate the incidence of difficult intubation as evaluated by the intubation difficulty scale as well as other specific predictive factors. The overall incidence of difficult intubation was 11.1% (95% CI: 7.6-14.5). Median intubation difficulty scale was 0 (25th-75th percentile: 0; 2.7). In three predefined groups (no echographic goiter, clinically palpable goiter, and impalpable goiter), difficult intubation occurred in 10% (95% CI: 4.8-17.4), 13% (95% CI: 6.5-18.4), and 11% (95% CI: 4.7-16.8) of patients, respectively, with no statistical difference among the groups. Specific predictive criteria (palpable goiter, endothoracic goiter, airway deformation, airway compression, or thyroid malignancy) were not associated with an increased rate of difficult intubation. Classical predictive criteria (mouth opening <35 mm, Mallampati III or IV, short neck, neck mobility <80 degrees , thyromental distance <65 mm, and a retrognathic mandible) were significantly reliable in the univariate analysis as risk factors for difficult intubation.",0,0
17505042,A pilot study of narrow-band imaging compared to white light bronchoscopy for evaluation of normal airways and premalignant and malignant airways disease,"Background: The objectives of this study were to characterize the appearance of normal, dysplastic, and frankly malignant airway lesion appearance under narrow-band imaging (NBI), and to determine if NBI, when used in conjunction with white light (WL) bronchoscopy, could improve detection of dysplasia and malignancy. Patients and methods: This was a prospective, partially blinded study at a university teaching hospital. Bronchoscopy was performed on 22 patients with known or suspected bronchial dysplasia or malignancy. Full airway examination was performed first under WL bronchoscopy and then under NBI. Directed endobronchial biopsies of likely dysplastic, malignant, and normal (control) areas were then performed and sent for examination by a pathologist blinded to the gross description of the lesion. Pathology interpretations were then compared to the corresponding WL and NBI images. Results: There were one malignant and four dysplastic lesions in 22 patients detected by NBI when findings by WL imaging were considered normal. In cases when the WL appearance was abnormal, NBI did not improve the diagnostic yield. The increased rate of detection of dysplasia and malignancy by NBI was statistically significant (p = 0.005). Conclusion: NBI identified dysplasia or malignancy that was not detected by WL inspection in 23% of subjects. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of NBI in detection of premalignant airways lesions in an at-risk population.",0,0
18463923,Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: presentation of ten cases and review of the literature,"Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is a rare benign disease of the endobronchial system with nonspecific symptoms and different treatment approaches. We report on a group of patients with TO and discuss their presentation and their treatment modalities. Between 2000 and 2006, the medical records of patients with TO were studied at the Interventional Pulmonary Unit of the Tracheal Disease Research Center at Masih Daneshvary Hospital, a referral center for respiratory diseases in Tehran, Iran. We analyzed and studied patients' demographics, symptom presentation, radiographic appearance, bronchoscopic findings, and their subsequent treatment. Of the 8,760 patients who underwent flexible bronchoscopy (FOB) at our center over 6 years, 10 were diagnosed with TO; their median age was 51 years (range = 16-68 years) and 6 were men. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed mucosal irregularity and calcified nodules. Histopathologic examination of tissue biopsy through bronchoscopy was used for definitive diagnosis of TO. Bronchoscopy findings showed the endobronchial lesions to be firm and glossy. Cartilaginous nodules were present in central airways. Treatment included endobronchial Nd:YAG laser photoevaporation (LPE) (n = 10), coring of the lesions with the tip of the rigid bronchoscope (n = 4), and endobronchial stent placement (n = 1). Symptoms were considerably relieved in six cases but there was no significant improvement noted in three patients. One patient died after 6 years of treatment and follow-up. TO is a rare disease and the diagnosis should be suspected based on CT findings or bronchoscopic examination of the airways. Histopathologic examination is required for confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment is palliative and it includes LPE, coring through a rigid bronchoscope, and endobronchial stent placement.",0,0
10752331,[Usefulness of laryngeal mask for difficult intubation in a child with congenital laryngeal webs],"We report a case of difficult intubation with congenital laryngeal web. An 11-year-old boy was scheduled for urinary surgery. After anesthetic induction, the anesthesiologist encountered resistance at the vocal cord preventing satisfactory intubation. A size 3 laryngeal mask was immediately inserted, and an adequate airway was obtained. We found a laryngeal web at the vocal cord by bronchoscope inserted thorough the laryngeal mask. The peroperative course was uneventful. Immediately after removal of the laryngeal mask, the patient developed airway obstruction due to sputum and/or laryngeal spasm. The obstruction was relieved through application of positive pressure ventilation and aspiration of the sputum.",0,0
8318242,Role of the laryngeal mask airway in the immobile cervical spine,"Study objective: To determine whether the laryngeal mask airway has a useful role in the airway management of patients whose cervical spines are immobilized in a rigid cervical collar. Design: A randomized study comparing the difficulty, rapidity, and success rate of ventilating patients with immobilized cervical spines using a laryngeal mask airway and an endotracheal tube. Setting: Medical center surgical unit. Patients: Twenty-eight ASA physical status I and II women scheduled to undergo elective gynecologic surgery requiring general anesthesia. Interventions: Tracheas of all anesthetized patients were sequentially intubated with an endotracheal tube and had a laryngeal mask inserted in random order. Measurements and main results: Mouth opening was measured, and a Mallampati classification was made in each subject both with and without a rigid Philadelphia collar in situ. The view at laryngoscopy was recorded. The time taken to insert both devices to allow for satisfactory ventilation and the degree of difficulty encountered were determined. With a cervical collar in situ, mouth opening was reduced up to 60%. The Mallampati assessment and laryngoscopic view were shifted to one suggestive of a more difficult intubation. The time taken to ventilate these patients and the difficulties encountered were significantly less when using the laryngeal mask (p = 0.0001). A successful outcome was more likely following insertion of the laryngeal mask than when attempting intubation with an endotracheal tube. Conclusions: The laryngeal mask airway compared favorably with an endotracheal tube in success rate, difficulty of insertion, and time to position correctly in this patient population. Although the laryngeal mask does not reliably protect against aspiration, we believe it may play a useful role if more conventional methods of airway management fail. Further studies in the trauma scenario are indicated.",0,0
21088593,"Validation of a model of graded difficulty in Laerdal SimMan: functional comparisons between Macintosh, Truview EVO2, Glidescope Video Laryngoscope and Airtraq","Background and objective: A randomised, cross-over study was designed to validate a new model of graded difficulty (based on mandibular space reduction) in the Laerdal 'SimMan' mannnequin and to suggest functional comparisons between Macintosh. Glidescope Video Laryngoscope, Truview EVO2 and Airtraq. Methods: Twenty anaesthetists attempted intubation with all four laryngoscopes in three settings: easy, intermediate (based on a custom-made removable prosthetic insert) and difficult ('tongue oedema', a mannnequin feature). Laryngoscopic view and time to intubate were the primary outcome measures. Other measures were successful intubation, ease of laryngoscopy [visual analogue scale (VAS)] and intubation (VAS), tongue compression score and number of attempts. Results: Between settings comparisons demonstrated that Macintosh, Glidescope and Airtraq had worsening scores from easy to intermediate with lesser changes for Truview. However, with the intermediate to difficult comparison, Airtraq was the only blade with no worsening of scores. Within-blade comparisons showed that Macintosh was superior over all in both the easy and intermediate settings, whereas Airtraq was the most successful blade in the difficult setting. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Glidescope and, to some extent Truview, are functionally similar to Macintosh and suffer from similar limitations in the difficult setting. On the contrary, Airtraq was functionally unique in providing good laryngeal exposure in the difficult setting and without excessive tongue compression.",0,0
10486626,[Procedures use by French anesthetists in cases of difficult intubation and the impact of a conference of experts],"Objective: To analyse the management of difficult intubation (DI) by French anaesthetists and the impact of the French experts' conference (EC) on this topic. Study design: Prospective, comparative, before/after study by questionnaire carried out in Aquitaine, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and Alsace-Lorraine. Material and methods: A questionnaire on demographical data, detection of DI, management techniques and desiderata for continuing education on DI, was sent three months before the publication of the EC to 100 randomly selected anaesthetists, in each region (group PRE). Three months after the diffusion of the EC, the questionnaire completed by a survey on the impact of the EC was sent to 100 other randomly selected anaesthetists in each region (group POST). In the latter group, anaesthetists who considered the EC were compared to those who did not. Results: The participation rate was 91% for the group PRE and 79% for the group POST respectively. Both groups were not significantly different for age, gender, position and seniority. Most used techniques that included blind nasal intubation (84%), intubation through laryngeal mask (82%), and intubation with fibrescope (53%). Demands for additional training were for translaryngeal ventilation (68%), intubation with fibrescope (64%), retrograde intubation (52%), and intubation through a laryngeal mask (46%). The EC was known by 71% of anaesthetists. In this group, the EC improved the assessment rate of the three recommended predictive criteria for DI from 12 to 28% (P < 0.02), but neither the management policy, nor the desiderata for additional training. Conclusion: Currently, the search of predictive indicators for DI is not systematically applied. The EC has only slightly modified the practice patterns. The need for additional training is important.",0,0
26045922,Airway management of patients with traumatic brain injury/C-spine injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is usually combined with cervical spine (C-spine) injury. The possibility of C-spine injury is always considered when performing endotracheal intubation in these patients. Rapid sequence intubation is recommended with adequate sedative or analgesics and a muscle relaxant to prevent an increase in intracranial pressure during intubation in TBI patients. Normocapnia and mild hyperoxemia should be maintained to prevent secondary brain injury. The manual-in-line-stabilization (MILS) technique effectively lessens C-spine movement during intubation. However, the MILS technique can reduce mouth opening and lead to a poor laryngoscopic view. The newly introduced video laryngoscope can manage these problems. The AirWay Scope® (AWS) and AirTraq laryngoscope decreased the extension movement of C-spines at the occiput-C1 and C2-C4 levels, improving intubation conditions and shortening the time to complete tracheal intubation compared with a direct laryngoscope. The Glidescope® also decreased cervical movement in the C2-C5 levels during intubation and improved vocal cord visualization, but a longer duration was required to complete intubation compared with other devices. A lightwand also reduced cervical motion across all segments. A fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided nasal intubation is the best method to reduce cervical movement, but a skilled operator is required. In conclusion, a video laryngoscope assists airway management in TBI patients with C-spine injury.",0,0
11698323,Asymptomatic lingual tonsillar hypertrophy and difficult airway management: a report of three cases,"Purpose: To report on the airway management of three cases of asymptomatic lingual tonsillar hypertrophy (LTH). Material: On three separate occasions, patients presenting for elective surgery were subsequently found to have asymptomatic LTH. In all cases preoperative airway examination was essentially unremarkable and no unusual difficulties were anticipated. In the first case, despite an inability to visualize the glottic opening, the patient was intubated successfully on the initial attempt and had no further problems in the perioperative period. In the second case, neither direct laryngoscopy, utilizing the MacIntosh and McCoy blades, nor fibreoptic visualization enabled successful intubation. Ventilation was maintained with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) until the anesthetic was reversible. Upon awakening and removal of the LMA, the patient totally obstructed and could not be ventilated, necessitating emergency cricothyroidotomy. The third patient was an elderly gentleman in whom successful intubation was eventually achieved, with considerable difficulty, by the otorhinolaryngologist (ENT surgeon) utilizing a straight blade. On a second occasion, he was again intubated by the same ENT surgeon, this time utilizing the anterior commissure blade. All three patients were subsequently discharged without further sequelae. Conclusion: Asymptomatic LTH can cause varying degrees of unexpected difficulty in securing the airway and, at present, no single method will necessarily improve the chances of successful intubation. Therefore, strategies to manage unanticipated difficult intubation secondary to supraglottic airway pathology need to be performed and practiced, including the establishment of a transtracheal airway.",0,0
22108392,Ketamine activates breathing and abolishes the coupling between loss of consciousness and upper airway dilator muscle dysfunction,"Background: Procedural sedation is frequently performed in spontaneously breathing patients, but hypnotics and opioids decrease respiratory drive and place the upper airway at risk for collapse. Methods: In a randomized, controlled, cross-over, pharmaco-physiologic study in 12 rats, we conducted acute experiments to compare breathing and genioglossus electromyogram activity at equianesthetic concentrations of ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that combines potent analgesic with hypnotic action effects, versus propofol. In 10 chronically instrumented rats resting in a plethysmograph, we measured these variables as well as electroencephalography during five conditions: quiet wakefulness, nonrapid-eye-movement sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, and low-dose (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and high-dose ketamine anesthesia (125 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Results: Ketamine anesthesia was associated with markedly increased genioglossus activity (1.5 to fivefold higher values of genioglossus electromyogram) compared with sleep- and propofol-induced unconsciousness. Plethysmography revealed a respiratory stimulating effect: higher values of flow rate, respiratory rate, and duty-cycle (effective inspiratory time, 1.5-to-2-fold higher values). During wakefulness and normal sleep, the δ (f = 6.51, P = 0.04) electroencephalogram power spectrum was an independent predictor of genioglossus activity, indicating an association between electroencephalographic determinants of consciousness and genioglossus activity. Following ketamine administration, electroencephalogram power spectrum and genioglossus electroencephalogram was dissociated (P = 0.9 for the relationship between δ/θ power spectrum and genioglossus electromyogram). Conclusions: Ketamine is a respiratory stimulant that abolishes the coupling between loss-of-consciousness and upper airway dilator muscle dysfunction in a wide dose-range. Ketamine compared with propofol might help stabilize airway patency during sedation and anesthesia.",0,0
25464047,Dynamic immobilization of simulated radionuclide 133Cs in soil by thermal treatment/vitrification with nanometallic Ca/CaO composites,"Although direct radiation induced health impacts were considered benign, soil contamination with (137)Cs, due to its long-term radiological impact (30 years half-life) and its high biological availability is of a major concern in Japan in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster. Therefore (137)Cs reduction and immobilization in contaminated soil are recognized as important problems to be solved using suitable and effective technologies. One such thermal treatment/vitrification with nanometallic Ca/CaO amendments is a promising treatment for the ultimate immobilization of simulated radionuclide (133)Cs in soil, showing low leachability and zero evaporation. Immobilization efficiencies were 88%, 95% and 96% when the (133)Cs soil was treated at 1200 °C with activated carbon, fly ash and nanometallic Ca/CaO additives. In addition, the combination of nanometallic Ca/CaO and fly ash (1:1) enhanced the immobilization efficiency to 99%, while no evaporation of (133)Cs was observed. At lower temperatures (800 °C) the leachable fraction of Cs was only 6% (94% immobilization). Through the SEM-EDS analysis, decrease in the amount of Cs mass percent detectable on soil particle surface was observed after soil vitrified with nCa/CaO + FA. The (133)Cs soil was subjected to vitrified with nCa/CaO + FA peaks related to Ca, crystalline phases (CaCO3/Ca(OH)2), wollastonite, pollucite and hematite appeared in addition to quartz, kaolinite and bentonite, which probably indicates that the main fraction of enclosed/bound materials includes Ca-associated complexes. Thus, the thermal treatment with the addition of nanometallic Ca/CaO and fly ash may be considered potentially applicable for the remediation of radioactive Cs contaminated soil at zero evaporation, relatively at low temperature.",0,0
26550391,Dangerous blind tracheal intubation attempt due to fiberscope non-availability in a pediatric patient with retropharyngeal abscess caused by a large fish bone,"In China, foods containing bones are sometimes fed to young infants. Occasionally, this practice results in bone aspiration and retropharyngeal abscess, a potentially life-threatening infection in the deep space of the neck that can compromise the airway. The main concern in managing patients with retropharyngeal abscess is airway management. In China, not all hospitals and operating rooms are equipped with fiberscopes, particularly pediatric-size fiberscopes. Emergency airway management can be dangerous when a fiberscope is unavailable. We present the case of a 21-month-old baby girl with a retropharyngeal abscess secondary to fish bone ingestion. During an attempted blind tracheal intubation due to fiberscope non-availability, the abscess ruptured, and the pus released from it obstructed the airway. The patient was successfully treated despite the inadequate resources and dangerous complication. We recommend a detailed preoperative airway assessment and preparation for fiberscopic tracheal intubation in such patients to prevent this dangerous complication.",0,0
21982179,Feasibility of written instructions in airway management training of laryngeal tube,"Background: Airway management is of essential importance in emergency care. Training and skill retention of endotracheal intubation (ETI) - the technique considered as the ""gold standard"" -, poses a problem especially among care providers experiencing a low frequency of airway management situations. Therefore, alternative airway devices such as the laryngeal tube (LT) with potentially steeper learning curves have been developed and studied. Our aim was to evaluate in a manikin model the use of LT after no other training than written instructions only. Methods: To evaluate the amount of training required to use the LT in a scenario of airway compromise, we assessed the feasibility of providing written instructions and pictures showing its use to 67 out- and in-hospital emergency care providers attending an Emergency Care conference. The majority of the participants were either nurses or firemen with a median of 5 years' history of work in emergency care. Results: In this study 55% of all participants inserted the LT on the first attempt without additional instructions. An additional 42% required verbal instructions before successful insertion. Overall, 97% of the participants successfully inserted the LT with two attempts.In logistic regression analysis, no relationship was detected between background variables (basic education, experience of emergency work, frequency of bag-valve-mask ventilation (BVM) and frequency of ETI) and successful insertion of the LT in less than 30 seconds, ability to maintain normoventilation (7 l/min) and need for further instructions during the test. Conclusions: We found that in this pilot study majority of emergency care providers could insert LT with one or two attempts with written instructions, pictures and verbal instruction. This may provide an option to simplify the training of airway management with LT.",0,0
15684291,Bronchoalveolar lavage in COPD: fluid recovery correlates with the degree of emphysema,"Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is an important research tool for assessing airway inflammation in a variety of inflammatory lung diseases. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), BAL recovery is often low, making analysis of the recovered fluid difficult to interpret. The present authors hypothesised that the degree of emphysema may predict BAL recovery. A total of 20 COPD patients (mean age 57 yrs, range 49-69) with a median (interquartile range) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 51 (33-69)% predicted underwent BAL. Matched ""healthy"" smokers and nonsmokers served as controls. Emphysema index in COPD patients was calculated on computed tomography scan as the percentage of the right lung with pixels <-950 Hounsfield units. The carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung (DL,CO) was determined by the single-breath method. COPD patients had lower BAL recovery than controls. COPD patients with an emphysema index <1 had higher BAL recovery than patients with an emphysema index >1. BAL recovery correlated negatively to emphysema index and positively to DL,CO. However, no correlation was found between recovery and FEV1. In conclusion, the extent of emphysema evaluated by computed tomography-scan index and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung may predict a low bronchoalveolar lavage recovery in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. These parameters may, therefore, be useful when chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients are selected for bronchoscopy with bronchoalveloar lavage. The present study underlines the importance of careful phenotyping of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.",0,0
14767368,"Biological markers in diagnosing, monitoring, and treating asthma: a focus on noninvasive measurements","Asthma is a major concern for society, healthcare professionals, and individuals and families directly affected by asthma due to rising morbidity rates and costs associated with the disease. The pathological hallmark of asthma is airway inflammation that is considered to be a major cause of exacerbations and persistent structural alterations of the airways. Assessing airway inflammation is important for investigating the underlying mechanisms of the disease and possibly for following the progression and resolution of the disease. The presence and type of airway inflammation can be difficult to detect clinically, and may result in delays in initiating appropriate therapy. The purpose of this article is to review noninvasive methods for assessing biological markers of airway inflammation and their potential role in the future for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating asthma. The article reviews the noninvasive measurements of induced sputum and exhaled nitric oxide as indicators of airway inflammation.",0,0
15983154,Use of the Aintree intubation catheter in a patient with an unexpected difficult airway,"Purpose: To present a case where the Aintree intubation catheter (AIC) was used in conjunction with the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) and a fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) in a patient with an unexpected difficult airway. Clinical features: A 38-yr-old 90 kg man scheduled for nasal endoscopy with ethmoidectomy under general anesthesia was found, unexpectedly, to be difficult to intubate using both a Macintosh laryngoscope (#4 blade) and a GlideScope video laryngoscope despite having an airway examination that was unremarkable except for slightly decreased mouth opening and a large tongue. Intubation was achieved by inserting a size 5 disposable LMA into the upper airway, introducing a FOB into an AIC inserting the FOB/AIC assembly into the trachea via the LMA, removing the LMA, and then passing a regular size (7.5 mm) endotracheal tube into the trachea over the AIC. Conclusion: In this patient, the AIC provided an effective alternative to other methods for intubating through a regular LMA.",0,0
23896488,Airway evaluation by indirect laryngoscopy in patients with lingual tonsillar hypertrophy,"Introduction and objectives: Prevalence of the lingual tonsillar hypertrophy is unknown but it is believed that its presence is associated with the difficult airway. To investigate this, indirect laryngoscopy was performed on patients in the preoperative evaluation and this pathology was diagnosed. The relationship with difficulty of viewing the larynx, intubation and ventilation, under general anaesthesia and using direct laryngoscopy, was then studied. Methods: We performed the demographic variable checks and tests for predicting difficult intubation (mouth opening, thyromental distance, cervical flexion-extension, neck thickness and Mallampati test), in the preoperative step on 300 patients who were going to be submitted to general anaesthesia. We then performed indirect laryngoscopy on them using a 70° rigid laryngoscope to ascertain the frequency of appearance of lingual tonsillar hypertrophy. Next, under general anaesthesia, we carried out direct laryngoscopy to verify whether there was difficulty in viewing the larynx and intubation and ventilation. We then investigated the association of demographic predictors of difficult intubation, including indirect laryngoscopy, with the presence of this condition. Results: Prevalence of lingual tonsillar hypertrophy was 2%. No relationship between the appearance of this entity and the difficulty of viewing the larynx, intubation and ventilation was found. Only indirect laryngoscopy was linked to the appearance of this pathology. Conclusions: Lingual tonsillar hypertrophy is a relatively frequent disorder, whose presence is not usually associated with difficult airway.",0,0
14700003,[Techniques and complementary techniques. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated children],"Fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be performed at the patient's bedside. This technique allows direct visualization of the upper and lower airways up to the segmental and subsegmental bronchi. Its most frequent indications are airway examination ot evaluate damage produced by toxins or the endotracheal tube, patency of the endotracheal tube and extubation failure. It is also used to obtain microbiological samples, facilitate intubation when difficult, aspirate airway sections or mucus plugs, perform bronchoalveolar lavage and administer drugs. With prior preparation, adequate monitoring and sedation, material according to the size of the patient and correct techniques, there are few complications. However, the procedure can produce trauma and obstruction of the airway, bronchial hemorrhage, barotrauma, loss of alveolar recruitment, bronchospasm, hypoxemia, bradycardia, and bronchopulmonary infection.",0,0
11714082,Quantification of the effect of inhaled budesonide on airway inflammation in intermittent asthma by bronchitis index,"The bronchitis index (BI) is a scoring system for the visual quantification of airway inflammation by flexible bronchoscopy. A prospective study was carried out to determine whether patients with intermittent asthma present a considerable visible airway inflammation. Ten steroid-naive patients with intermittent asthma taking only inhaled beta2-agonists were enrolled and received budesonide (800 microg/day) over a period of 4 weeks. The airway inflammation was assessed by flexible electronic videobronchoscopy before and after the steroid treatment phase and quantified using the BI. Despite normal pulmonary function, all patients with intermittent asthma showed a marked visible airway inflammation that was reversed by a 4-week treatment with the inhaled steroid budesonide. The present study demonstrates that the BI may be useful as a clinical research tool for the assessment and quantification of airway inflammation in asthma. Furthermore, our results support the widely recognized theory that airway inflammation is present even in patients with mild asthma, and emphasize the necessity of an early therapy with inhaled steroids.",0,0
23809781,[Analysis of difficult intubation factors in bariatric surgery. Influence of the choice of neuromuscular blocker on the availability of sugammadex],"Objective: To determine the incidence of difficult tracheal intubation (DTI), as well as predictive factors for DTI and what influences the choice of the neuromuscular blocking agent (succinylcholine or rocuronium). Methods: This is an observational, prospective study on consecutive bariatric surgery patients. Tracheal intubation was performed by direct laryngoscopy with a preformed tracheal tube. DTI was considered when there was a Cormack-Lehane classification of iii-iv or when it was necessary to apply the DTI algorithm, which consisted in the use of Frova guide, and Airtraq video-laryngoscope as second choice, and finally awaking the patient and sugammadex reversal if rocuronium was the selected neuromuscular blocking agent. Thereafter, tracheal intubation was performed using an awake fibroscopic technique Results: One hundred and sixty six patients were included. In one case, conscious fiberscope tracheal intubation was performed. Succinylcholine was selected for 14 patients, and rocuronium for 151 patients. Fifteen patients had a DTI (9%): in 4 Airtraq was deemed necessary. One patient received sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular blockade. Conscious tracheal intubation represented 1.2% (95% CI; 0.3-4%). DTI was associated with Mallampati score of 3-4 (odds ratio, 3 [95% CI; 1.37-6.8], sensitivity of 33%, specificity of 91%) and with thyromental distance<6cm (odds ratio, 4.8 [95% CI; 1.45-16]; sensitivity of 53%; specificity of 79%).

11939440,The modified Cormack-Lehane score for the grading of direct laryngoscopy: evaluation in the Asian population,"The use of a modified Cormack-Lehane scoring system (MCLS) of laryngoscopic views, as previously introduced in the Western population, was investigated during direct laryngoscopy in the Asian population. We studied the distribution of the different grades of MCLS, the predictive factors and rate of difficult laryngoscopy, and the association with difficult intubation. Six hundred and five patients requiring tracheal intubation during general anaesthesia were prospectively studied. The optimal views during direct laryngoscopy were scored using the 5-grade MCLS system. The distribution of the laryngoscopy scores was 73.9% Grade 1 (full view of the vocal cords), 21.0% Grade 2A (partial view of the vocal cords), 3.3% Grade 2B (only the arytenoids and epiglottis seen), 1.6% Grade 3 (only epiglottis visible) and 0.2% Grade 4 (neither the epiglottis nor glottis seen). External laryngeal pressure was necessary in 45.3% of cases to optimize laryngoscopic views. Grade 2B was associated with significantly higher incidence of difficult intubation compared with Grade 2A (65% vs 13.4%). The rates of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation were 5.1% and 6.9% respectively. The Mallampati classification and thyromental distance were associated with low predictive value for difficult laryngoscopy. The MCLS better delineates the difficulty experienced during laryngoscopy than the original Cormack-Lehane grading",1,1
20661197,Tracheal intubation using the mobile C-MAC video laryngoscope or direct laryngoscopy for patients with a simulated difficult airway,"Background: Several studies have shown that video laryngoscopy enhances the laryngeal view in patients with apparently normal and anticipated difficult airways. The utility of the novel, portable, battery-powered C-MAC video laryngoscope is unproven, but its design makes it potentially useful for emergency situations. We hypothesized that, in patients with a simulated difficult airway created by means of a rigid cervical immobilization collar, the rate of glottic views considered ""failed"" under direct laryngoscopy could be significantly reduced with the C-MAC video laryngoscope. Methods: Following power analysis and ethical approval, 43 adults undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were studied. First, direct laryngoscopy was performed with the naked eye with and without applying external laryngeal pressure (BURP maneuver). The best-obtained view was graded by the laryngoscopist without looking at the video monitor. A second anesthesiologist, who was blinded to the laryngeal view obtained under direct laryngoscopy, graded the laryngeal view on the video monitor. A difficult airway was then created and the laryngoscopy sequence repeated. Endotracheal intubation was then attempted under video-aided visualization. Results: In patients with a normal airway, the glottic view was considered as ""good"" in the vast majority of patients (40-43/43; 93-100%) regardless of the laryngoscopy technique used. When a difficult airway was created, the glottic view was graded as ""failed"" in 30/43 (70%) and 16/43 (37%) of patients under direct laryngoscopy without and with the BURP maneuver, respectively (P=0.0047). Using video laryngoscopy, significantly fewer laryngoscopic views were graded as ""failed"" without (14%, P<0.0001) and with the BURP maneuver (5%, P=0.0003) compared to direct laryngoscopy. Endotracheal tube placement was successful in 88% of patients with a difficult airway. Conclusion: The C-MAC video laryngoscope effectively enhanced the laryngeal view in patients with limited inter-incisor distance and eliminated cervical spine clearance. However, endotracheal tube placement failed in 5/43 patients despite a mostly good laryngeal view.",0,0
8055603,"The airway: problems and predictions in 18,500 patients","The purpose of this study was to describe methods, risk factors, and outcomes of airway management in all patients (obstetrics excluded) attended by anaesthetists over 27 months. Preoperatively, anaesthetists recorded patient factors and assessed four airway characteristics. Methods of tracheal intubation and ease of direct laryngoscopy following general anaesthesia (easy, awkward, difficult) were noted. Factors predictive of poor outcome and the value of the preoperative airway examination were determined. For 18,205 patients following a direct laryngoscopy, (GA), tracheal intubation was difficult (> 2 laryngoscopies) in 1.8% and awkward (< or = 2 laryngoscopies) in 2.5%. This approach was a failure in 0.3%, and surgery was postponed in 0.05%. However, an alternative approach to direct laryngoscopy, (GA) was the first choice in 353 patients. Risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation included male sex, age 40-59 yr and obesity (P < or = 0.01). For direct laryngoscopy, (GA), airway characteristics predictive of difficult tracheal intubation were decreased mouth opening (relative risk 10.3), shortened thyromental distance (9.7), poor visualization of the hypopharynx (4.5), and limited neck extension (3.2), any two (7.6) and more than two (9.4) (P < 0.01). For 1,856 patients (10.0%) where at least one airway characteristic was abnormal, a direct laryngoscopy, (GA) resulted in 8.3% awkward and 6.0% difficult tracheal intubations. For patients with no abnormal airway characteristics, tracheal intubation was easy in 96.3%. Where tracheal intubation was difficult, 34.3% of patients had one or more abnormal airway characteristics preoperatively. Patients with difficult tracheal intubation had an increased rate of desaturation (< 90%), hypertension (> 200 mm Hg) and dental damage on induction of anaesthesia. It is concluded that difficult tracheal intubations occurred infrequently but were associated with increased morbidity. Patient factors and four physical airway characteristics were useful predictors but limited in identifying all problems.",0,0
11282760,The effect of salmeterol on markers of airway inflammation following segmental allergen challenge,"Inflammation is a critical component of asthma. Drugs that control asthma generally reduce the degree of airway inflammation. There is theoretical controversy surrounding the effects of beta(2)-agonists on airway inflammation, with some studies suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect, and others predicting a proinflammatory influence. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the effect of the long-acting beta(2)-agonist salmeterol on airway inflammation induced by segmental allergen challenge (SAC). We studied 13 allergic asthmatics controlled with as needed inhaled short-acting beta(2)-agonists alone, and used bronchoalveolar lavage 5 min and 48 h after SAC to assess airway inflammation, and the effects of salmeterol on this process. Salmeterol therapy improved FEV(1), but had no significant effect on the immediate or late cellular response to SAC. One measure of superoxide production was reduced, and interleukin-4 (IL-4) was reduced in baseline samples, but other indices of airway inflammation were unchanged by salmeterol therapy. We conclude that salmeterol therapy alone does not meaningfully reduce airway inflammation induced by SAC, but equally importantly, does not result in amplified inflammation.",0,0
10417457,The use of cricoid pressure with the intubating laryngeal mask,"Unexpected difficulty with tracheal intubation contributes to anaesthetic morbidity and mortality. The intubating laryngeal mask is effective in facilitating blind intubation. We have evaluated the effect of cricoid pressure on the ability to insert an intubating laryngeal mask, and to pass a tracheal tube through it. Insertion and intubation through the mask were attempted in 50 patients, Mallampati grade 1-3, randomly allocated to cricoid and noncricoid pressure groups. Tracheal intubation was successful in 21 (84%) of the noncricoid group and 13 (52%) of the cricoid group (p = 0.03). Cricoid pressure may have to be released to allow correct placement and intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask.",0,0
24864578,[Airway obstruction during attempts at fiberoptic intubation in an awake patient],"A 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was scheduled for lumbar anterior fusion (L5-S1). The patient had undergone several major operations on the cervical to the lumbar spine. Cervical spine movement was severely restricted, the mouth opening was limited (inter-incisor distance 3 cm), and the jaw was small (thyro-mental distance 2 cm). During previous anesthesia tracheal intubation was always difficult. Fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation while the patient was sedated was planned. After bilateral superior laryngeal nerves had been blocked using 1% lidocaine, sedation was achieved using midazolam 1.4 mg and fentanyl 0.025 mg. Fiberscopy showed an edematous larynx, due probably to rheumatoid arthritis and to a long-term steroid therapy. It was possible to insert a fiberscope into the trachea, but it was difficult to pass a reinforced tube (6.0 mmID) and the procedure led to airway obstruction with a decreased arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation. At the second attempt at fiberoptic intubation a rapidly swollen larynx was observed and awake intubation was abandoned. Fiberoptic intubation could be perfomed after induction of general anesthesia. This case indicates that, although awake fiberoptic intubation is regarded as the safest and the most reliable method, this may also be associated with severe airway obstruction.",0,0
17260689,Beyond the basics: airway management,"Airway management is as easy as your ABCs: Assess the airway for adequacy, blockages and sixth-sense concerns; use basic skills to position, utilize adjuncts and suction the airway; and control the airway with endotracheal intubation, alternative airways, or, when all else fails, invasive and surgical airways. It is the responsibility of every provider, regardless of certification level, to manage a patient's airway in the most effective way possible. When it's done in an organized manner, quickly, properly and effectively, considering all options of care, both patient and provider will be able to take a deep breath of relief.",0,0

11194523,Airway rescue with the intubating laryngeal mask in a patient with an unexpectedly large epiglottic cyst,We report the successful use of the intubating laryngeal mask airway for rescue and intubation in an anaesthetised patient with an unexpectedly large epiglottic cyst. This case illustrates that airway rescue and intubation with the intubating laryngeal mask is possible and preoperative airway assessment does not always provide reliable information about airway management.,0,0
24209989,[Anesthesia in spontaneous ventilation for difficult intubation],"Difficult intubation in children is rare and often predictable during anesthesia consultation. This allows to establish a strategy to provide fiberoptic guided tracheal intubation with spontaneous ventilation in function of age and children pathology. A good knowledge of physiologic and anatomic children particularities, of fiberoptic technique and the respect for some principles lead to ensure the security of this procedure. First principle is to use only one anesthetic inhaled or intravenous agent in order to limit an important decrease of ventilation. The anesthetic technique recommended for pediatric fiberoptic guided intubation is inhaled anesthesia with sevoflurane. But it is possible to use an intravenous agent, like propofol, with a continuous infusion (bolus of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg then 0.1-0.3mg/kg per hour for maintenance) or with target controlled infusion (Schnider model, initial concentration 2.5 μg/mL, then increase by 0.5 μg/mL steps) particularly in children older than 5 years with an anesthetic depth control. Whatever the agent, the dose must to be titrated to maintain spontaneous ventilation. Second principle is to combine an airway local anesthesia with general anesthesia to limit airway reactivity. First, a nose topical anesthesia is administered with lidocaine plus naphazoline in children older than 2 years. Then, a laryngeal topical anesthesia is realized with lidocaine 1% (1-2 mL, 2mg/kg) through operating channel of fiberoptic bronchoscope. Finally, third principle is to ensure patient oxygenation with several techniques like use of endoscopic facial mask or nasopharyngeal tube. The use of laryngeal mask is a rescue technique in case of spontaneous ventilation lost. In conclusion, each institution has to establish an algorithm with his own knowledge, constantly feasible and regularly taught.",0,0
17530140,Tracheal intubation,"Objective: To review current concepts related to the procedure of tracheal intubation in children. Sources: Relevant articles published from 1968 to 2006 were selected from the MEDLINE, LILACS and SciELO databases, using the keywords intubation, tracheal intubation, child, rapid sequence intubation and pediatric airway. Summary of the findings: Airway management in children is related to their physiology and anatomy, in addition to specific factors (inherent pathological conditions, such as malformations or acquired conditions) which have a decisive influence on success. Principal indications are in order to maintain the airway patent and to control ventilation. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation cause cardiovascular alterations and affect airway reactivity. The use of tubes with cuffs is not prohibited, as long as the correct size for the child is chosen. A difficult airway can be identified against the Mallampati scale and by direct laryngoscopy. Rapid sequence intubation is being recommended more and more often in pediatrics, since it facilitates the procedure and presents fewer complications. Tracheal intubation should be carried out in an adequate manner in special circumstances (eaten recently, neurological dysfunction, unstable spinal column, upper airway obstruction, laryngotracheal injuries, injuries to the eyeball). Extubation should be meticulously planned, since there is chance of failure and a need for reintubation. Conclusions: Tracheal intubation of children requires knowledge, skill and experience, since, if the procedure is carried out by inexperienced pediatricians, it can result in life-threatening complications.",0,0
21156978,First clinical evaluation of the C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope during routine and difficult intubation,"In the present preliminary study we evaluated the C-MAC® D-Blade (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), a new videolaryngoscopic C-MAC blade for difficult intubation, during both routine and difficult intubations. First, both the conventional direct laryngoscopy and the D-Blade were used in 15 consecutive patients with normal airways during routine induction of anesthesia. Second, the D-Blade was used as a rescue device in 20 of 300 (6.7%) consecutive patients, when conventional direct laryngoscopy failed. In the 15 patients during routine induction of anesthesia, with direct laryngoscopy, a Cormack-Lehane (C/L) grade 1 and grade 2a view was seen in 7 and 8 patients, respectively. It was possible to insert the D-Blade and to get a video view of the glottis on the first attempt in all patients; with the D-Blade, all 15 patients had a C/L 1 view. The time to successful intubation with the D-Blade was 15 (8-26) seconds (median (range)). In the 20 patients, in whom unexpected difficulty with direct laryngoscopy was observed, C/L grades 3 and 4 were present in 15 and 5 patients, respectively. With the use of the D-Blade, indirect C/L video view improved to C/L class 1 in 15 patients, and to 2a in 5 patients, respectively. The time from touching the laryngoscope to optimal laryngoscopic view was 11 (5-45) seconds and for successful intubation 17 (3-80) seconds. In all 35 patients, with the D-Blade no direct view of the glottis was possible and subsequently a semiflexible tube guide was required.",0,0
15821222,Airway management of the critically ill patient: rapid-sequence intubation,"Advances in emergency airway management have allowed intensivists to use intubation techniques that were once the province of anesthesiology and were confined to the operating room. Appropriate rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, induction drugs, and adjunctive medications in a standardized approach improves clinical outcomes for select patients who require intubation. However, many physicians who work in the ICU have insufficient experience with these techniques to adopt them for routine use. The purpose of this article is to review airway management in the critically ill adult with an emphasis on airway assessment, algorithmic approaches, and RSI.",0,0
8623943,Force and torque vary between laryngoscopists and laryngoscope blades,"Several studies have examined the effects of patient characteristics on force of laryngoscopy, but little attention has been paid to the importance of technique and equipment. This study investigated whether force, torque, head extension, and view varied significantly between laryngoscopists and compared force and torque using Macintosh 3 and Miller 2 blades. The study population consisted of ASA grade I and II patients requiring general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation for elective surgery. Force, torque, head extension, and laryngeal view were highly reproducible when laryngoscopy was repeated by the same individual, Force and torque showed great variation between laryngoscopies performed by different anesthetists, For example, peak force varied over a range of 56 newtons among patients, but could also vary as much as 30 newtons between different anesthetists repeating laryngoscopy in the same patient. Force and head extension were 30% less with Miller laryngoscope compared to the Macintosh. Thus, laryngoscopic force and torque depend on technique and equipment. Further studies of force and torque may lead to improved techniques. The force-measuring laryngoscope could be a useful tool in teaching laryngoscopy.",0,0
22986421,Failed tracheal intubation in obstetric anaesthesia: 2 yr national case-control study in the UK,"Background: There are few national figures on the incidence of failed tracheal intubation during general anaesthesia in obstetrics. Recent small studies have quoted a rate of one in 250 general anaesthetics (GAs). The aim of this UK national study was to estimate this rate and identify factors that may be predictors. Methods: Using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) of data collection, a survey was conducted between April 2008 and March 2010. Incidence and associated risk factors were recorded in consultant-led UK delivery suites. Units reported the details of any failed intubation (index case) and the two preceding GA cases (controls). Predictors were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, significance P<0.05 (two-sided). Results: We received 57 completed reports (100% response). The incidence using a unit-based estimation approach was one in 224 (95% confidence interval 179-281). Univariate analyses showed the index cases to be significantly older, heavier, with higher BMI, with Mallampati score recorded and score >1. Multivariate analyses showed that age, BMI, and a recorded Mallampati score were significant independent predictors of failed tracheal intubation. The classical laryngeal mask airway was the most commonly used rescue airway (39/57 cases). There was one emergency surgical airway but no deaths or hypoxic brain injuries. Gastric aspiration occurred in four (8%) index cases. Index cases were more likely to have maternal morbidities (P=0.026) and many babies in both groups were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit: 21 (37%) vs 29 (27%) (NS). Three babies died--all in the control group.",0,0
23073169,Thyroid ala cartilage graft laryngotracheoplasty for closure of large pediatric tracheocutaneous fistula,"We describe a novel technique for closure of a large, persistent, pediatric tracheocutaneous fistula using a thyroid ala cartilage graft. Case report and review of the literature. We report 2 cases of large (>4mm), pediatric tracheocutaneous fistulas, in which primary closure of the tracheal defect would have caused critical airway narrowing and were managed with an anterior laryngotracheal reconstruction with a thyroid ala cartilage graft and closure of the tracheocutaneous fistula. The patients were extubated immediately postoperatively and maintained successfully closed fistulas with no clinically significant airway compromise. One of the considerations in pediatric tracheocutaneous fistula closure is to assess how the airway luminal diameter will be affected by primary closure of the tracheal defect. If primary closure of the tracheal opening causes critical airway narrowing because of a large tracheocutaneous fistula, a thyroid ala cartilage graft may be used for laryngotracheoplasty and allow for primary closure with a layered closure of the overlying strap muscles and soft tissue.",0,0
12131106,Positioning in anesthesiology: toward a better understanding of stretch-induced perioperative neuropathies,"Background: Stretch-induced neuropathy of the brachial plexus and median nerve in conventional perioperative care remains a relatively frequent and poorly understood complication. Guidelines for positioning have been formulated, although the protective effect of most recommendations remains unexamined. The similarity between the stipulated potentially dangerous positions and the components of the brachial plexus tension test (BPTT) justified the analysis of the BPTT to quantify the impact of various arm and neck positions on the peripheral nervous system. Methods: Four variations of the BPTT in three different shoulder positions were performed in 25 asymptomatic male participants. The impact of arm and neck positions on the peripheral nervous system was evaluated by analyzing the maximal available range of motion, pain intensity, and type of elicited symptoms during the BPTT. Results: Cervical contralateral lateral flexion, lateral rotation of the shoulder and fixation of the shoulder girdle in a neutral position in combination with shoulder abduction, and wrist extension all significantly reduced the available range of motion. Elbow extension also challenged the nervous system substantially. A cumulative impact could be observed when different components were simultaneously added, and a neutralizing effect was noted when an adjacent region allowed for unloading of the nervous system. Conclusions: The experimental findings support the experientially based guidelines for positioning. Especially when simultaneously applied, submaximal joint positions easily load the nervous system, which may substantially compromise vital physiologic processes in and around the nerve. Therefore, even when the positioning of all upper limb joints is carefully considered, complete prevention of perioperative neuropathy seems almost inconceivable.",0,0
15464510,New tubular bioabsorbable knitted airway stent: feasibility assessment for delivery and deployment in a dog model,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether it is possible to deliver and deploy a new device, a poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) tubular knitted airway stent, under bronchoscopic guidance in a dog model. Description: The delivery system consisted of a flexible balloon catheter (controlled radial expansion balloon dilator, M00558440, Boston Scientific Corporation, MA, USA) preloaded with a stent. A delivery catheter preloaded with a stent was advanced to a target point in the trachea under bronchoscopic guidance. Once the stent was positioned, the balloon was inflated for sixty seconds. The stent was in full contact with the tracheal wall upon deflation of the balloon. Evaluation: The stents were successfully delivered into the tracheal lumen and successfully deployed in all dogs. Conclusions: This is the first study to prove the feasibility of delivering and deploying the PLLA stents in a dog model, using a balloon expansion technique. Further investigation with large numbers of subjects and long-term follow-up will be necessary to assess the utility of the bioabsorbable knitted tubular stent before clinical applications begin.",0,0
11559603,An observational survey of emergency department rapid sequence intubation,"Objectives: To study the current practice of rapid sequence intubations (RSIs) in four different emergency medicine training programmes in the UK. Methods: Observational study design involving four regional training programmes (Wessex, North West, Yorkshire, Avon). Data were collected in real time using a previously piloted survey tool. Data were collected by specialist registrars in emergency medicine over a continuous 28 day period. Data collected included: indications for RSI; key timings of RSI procedures; details of RSI practitioner; complications and outcome of procedure. Results: Data from 60 RSIs were recorded and collected. The majority of decisions to perform RSIs were made by emergency physicians (74% cases). Over 50% of the RSIs occurred after 4 pm. Emergency physicians performed 26% of RSIs although the majority were performed by anaesthetists. Most of the given indications for RSIs were based on an assessment of airway protection. Hypoxia was an uncommon reason for RSI in this study (5%). In two thirds of cases the time taken from the decision being made to perform an RSI, to the achievement of successful intubation, was greater than 20 minutes. No failed intubations were recorded, although six other complications (all minor problems) were recorded. There was no significant difference in the response times between anaesthetists and emergency physicians. Conclusions: This study shows that emergency physicians are currently performing RSIs in emergency departments in the UK. It also suggests improvements could be made to patient care. In particular, standards of care should be agreed for the provision of RSI in the emergency department, including the personnel involved and the appropriate training of individuals. RSI activity in emergency departments in the UK should be audited nationally using an agreed audit tool.",0,0
26142493,Truview EVO2 Laryngoscope Reduces Intubation Difficulty in Maxillofacial Surgeries,"Purpose: Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of the Truview EVO2 for the management of patients with potentially difficult airways. However, the comparison of Truview EVO2 with the classic Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with maxillofacial trauma remains unevaluated. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the intubation conditions with the Truview EVO2 video laryngoscope and the Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with maxillofacial injury. Materials and methods: Forty-two patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists status I and II requiring nasotracheal intubation for maxillofacial surgery were included in this prospective randomized trial. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 μg/kg, propofol 2 to 3 mg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg. Intubation was performed with the Macintosh laryngoscope or the Truview EVO2 video laryngoscope. Comparative data based on the Intubation Difficulty Scale score were assessed as the primary outcome. Laryngoscopic view, time taken for glottis visualization, time taken to pass the endotracheal tube, total time to intubate, and the number of optimizing and hemodynamic variables were recorded as secondary outcomes. Results: The 2 groups were comparable in patient characteristics and preoperative airway assessment parameters. The Intubation Difficulty Scale score was significantly less in the Truview EVO2 group compared with the Macintosh group (mean ± standard deviation, 0.30 ± 0.7 vs 1.70 ± 1.8; P = .002). The Truview EVO2 video laryngoscope required significantly less time for glottic visualization (9.40 ± 10.9; P = .002). The Truview EVO2 provided a significantly better laryngoscopic view as graded by the percentage of glottic opening and the modified Cormack-Lehane grading system compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope (P < .002). The hemodynamic variables, number of optimizing maneuvers, and the incidence of side-effects were comparable in the 2 groups. Conclusion: The Truview EVO2 performs better than the Macintosh laryngoscope because it considerably decreases the intubation difficulty in patients undergoing maxillofacial surgeries. Therefore, the Truview EVO2 could be a good alternative for managing a difficult airway in patients with maxillofacial injury.",0,0
1755680,Main bronchial sleeve resection with pulmonary conservation,"Twenty-seven main bronchial resections (19 left, 8 right) were performed without pulmonary resection between 1975 and 1991. The patients were 17 men and 9 women with an average age of 35 years (range, 20 to 65 years). Tumors comprised 55% of the lesions, including 9 carcinoid tumors (33%), 2 mucoepidermoid tumors, 2 fibrous histiocytomas, 1 hemangiopericytoma, and 1 large cell carcinoma. Scarring and stenosis secondary to multiple causes occurred in 10 patients (37%). Two patients had miscellaneous lesions. Presenting symptoms included dyspnea (52%), wheezing or stridor (44%), cough (41%), hemoptysis (37%), and pneumonia (18%). Preoperative chest roentgenogram was abnormal in 60% of patients, whereas tomograms delineated the lesion in 94%. All patients had bronchoscopy for lesion evaluation. Anesthesia was accomplished through a long single-lumen endotracheal tube in 19 cases and a double-lumen tube in 8 cases. Mobilization and exposure techniques to create a tension-free anastomosis were critical for left main bronchial resections and included pretracheal mobilization (100%), neck flexion (100%), tracheal and main bronchial retraction (85%), aortic and pulmonary artery retraction (44%), and intrapericardial hilar release (33%). All resections were for cure; there was no operative mortality. Morbidity in 4 patients (15%) included an anastomotic stenosis (successfully reresected), prolonged air leak and pneumonia, transient recurrent nerve palsy, and atelectasis. Median 5-year follow-up revealed 92% of patients alive, with only one of two late deaths being disease-related. Main bronchial resection is an ideal technique for selected benign and malignant lesions, allowing complete pulmonary parenchymal preservation.",0,0

17006065,Alfentanil dosage when inserting the classic laryngeal mask airway,"Background: The purpose of this study was to determine an optimum dose of alfentanil, coadministered with 2.5 mg/kg propofol, when inserting a classic laryngeal mask airway. Methods: Seventy-five adult ethnic Chinese patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physiologic status classification I or II and requiring anesthesia for minor surgery with a laryngeal mask were recruited. They were randomly assigned to five dosage groups: placebo or 5, 10, 15, or 20 microg/kg. The study drug plus propofol were administered, and 90 s later, insertion conditions were assessed using a six-category score. The duration of apnea was recorded. A probit analysis was performed and used to estimate the ED50 and ED95 with 95% confidence intervals for each assessment. Results: Twenty-five male and 50 female patients, aged 18-59 yr, were studied. The five groups were similar. Laryngeal mask insertion was successful in all but one alfentanil patient. Duration of apnea increased with increasing dosage of alfentanil to over 5 min (P < 0.001). Dose-responses could not be predicted for categories of resistance to mouth opening and to insertion. For the other four categories, swallowing, gagging, movement, and laryngospasm, ED50 and ED95 with confidence intervals for alfentanil could be determined. Conclusion: The optimum dose for alfentanil, when coadministered with 2.5 mg/kg propofol, was 10 microg/kg.",0,0
23993810,Early lung cancer: methods for detection,"Early detection and surgical resection are essential for the treatment of lung cancer. It would be ideal to be able to detect and treat preinvasive bronchial lesions, defined as dysplasia and carcinoma in situ before progressing to invasive cancer. Advanced airway-assessment techniques have opened an avenue for early detection and surveillance of endobronchial malignancy. This article reviews currently available advanced imaging techniques for early detection of lung cancer, including autofluorescence bronchoscopy, narrow-band imaging, high-magnification bronchovideoscopy, endobronchial ultrasonography, and optical coherence tomography.

15675989,Decreased tongue mobility -- an explanation for difficult endotracheal intubation?,"Established parameters predictive of difficulty in airway management were inconclusive in five ear, nose and throat (ENT) patients. All presented with degrees of tongue fixation - restriction of movement. Initially, experienced anaesthetists concluded that conventional endotracheal intubation would present no problems. Later, there were adjustments to this conclusion, with the ultimate being that four of the patients underwent fibre-optic intubation: one electively, two after repeated failed conventional attempts and one after a failed attempt of retrograde intubation. The last patient underwent elective retrograde intubation. All intubations were performed uneventfully in anaesthetized or sedated patients under spontaneous respiration. We found that tongue fixation was a direct cause of failed conventional endotracheal intubation, and recommend that a detailed tongue status investigation should be routine during Mallampati evaluation. Any abnormality should be seen as predictive of difficult/impossible conventional direct laryngoscopic intubation.",0,0
20394253,Association between factors predicting and assessing the airway and use of intubating laryngeal mask airway,"Background and objective: The Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway FastrachTM (ILMA) has been used with success in difficult intubation cases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of mouth opening, Mallampati classification, thyromental distance and Cormack-Lehane Grade, on the ease of ILMA use. Methods: Eighty one patients ASA I-II, were assessed preoperatively for mouth opening, Mallampati classification and thyromental distance. After induction with propofol and rocuronium, the first investigator recorded Cormack-Lehane Grade by direct laryngoscopy. Subsequently an appropriate size ILMAwas inserted by the second investigator and correct placement was confirmed by adequate ventilation and normal capnogram. A maximum of three ILMA insertion attempts were allowed and the number was recorded. Then blind intubation was attempted and classified as follows, according to Intubation Difficulty Grade (IDG): IDG-1: intubation succeeded: at first attempt requiring no or minor ILMA manipulations. IDG-2: intubation succeeded at second attempt requiring major ILMA manipulations or size change. IDG-3: intubation failed after the second attempt or oesophageal intubation occurred at either attempt. In failure of the technique direct laryngoscopy was the alternative approach. Results: Success rates in insertion of ILMA and in blind intubation were 100% and 92.6% respectively. No difference was found between Cormack-Lehane Grade I-II and II-IV or Mallampati classification and number of ILMA insertion attempts or IDG. There was also no correlation between mouth opening, or thyromental distance and number of ILMA insertion attempts or IDG. It is concluded that easiness of ILMA use is irrelevant to mouth opening, thyromental distance, Mallampati classification or Cormack-Lehane Grade.",0,0
9557915,Use of the laryngeal mask for management of the compromised airway--a case report,"A 54-year old woman was scheduled for thoracotomy for excision of a tumor of the left upper lobe. Reduced thyromental distance and thyroid enlargement were identified by the preoperative physical examination and inability to visualize the larynx was encountered during direct laryngoscopy. A 37-Fr left sided double lumen tube was inserted in trachea with great difficulty after three failed attempts. One lung anesthesia underwent uneventfully and postoperatively it was decided to exchange the double lumen tube to a single lumen tracheal tube. After the extubation, five failed attempts of reintubation were performed. A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) size 3 was passed easily achieving an airtight airway. The patient underwent an uneventful prolonged (105 min) weaning via the LMA which was left in place until the patient regained full consciousness. Peripheral oxygen saturation remained greater than 95% throughout the airway manipulation. LMA insertion is an easy non-invasive technique and should be considered whenever airway management proves difficult.",0,0
15655687,Neck muscle length modulates nociceptive reflex evoked by noxious irritant application to rat neck tissues,"The application of mustard oil (MO), a small-fibre excitant and inflammatory irritant, into neck paraspinal muscles of the rat has been shown to produce a significant reflexive increase in electromyographic (EMG) activity in both neck and jaw muscles. It is possible that this nociceptive reflex activity is influenced by muscle length since recent evidence indicates that abnormal neck posture may be associated with cervical musculoskeletal disorders and pain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test if muscle length modulates this nociceptive reflex response. Three different experimental procedures were employed in rats under halothane anesthesia: (1) MO injected into the left deep neck muscles with the rat placed in a straight body position (Straight group, n = 7); (2) MO injected into lengthened left deep neck muscles with the rat's neck rotated 45 degrees to the right with respect to the head (Stretched group, n = 11); and (3) MO injected into the right deep neck muscles with the rat's neck rotated 45 degrees to the right (Relaxed group, n = 9). The EMG activity of the deep neck, trapezius, and digastric muscles was bilaterally recorded, rectified and integrated into area under the curve (AUC). Control injections of the vehicle, mineral oil, did not evoke any muscle activity but MO evoked EMG activity in the ipsilateral deep neck and trapezius muscles of the Stretched group that was significantly greater than that evoked in the same muscles in the Straight and Relaxed groups. Also, the MO-evoked EMG activity in the contralateral deep neck muscles of the Stretched and Relaxed groups was greater than that of the corresponding muscles in the Straight group. The MO-evoked activity in the digastric, a jaw muscle whose length was not changed, did not show any significant difference between the three groups. These findings indicate that MO application to the rat deep neck muscles results in a larger nociceptive reflex in deep neck and trapezius muscles when they are stretched. This enhanced muscle activity could be associated with changes in the susceptibility of the neck muscles to pain or damage.",0,0
23590463,Stylet- or forceps-guided tube exchanger to facilitate GlideScope intubation in simulated difficult intubations--a randomised controlled trial,"The GlideScope videolaryngoscope is widely used in the management of the difficult airway. However, passing the tracheal tube through the vocal cords can be awkward, and the use of a stylet to guide insertion is recommended. This randomised controlled trial evaluated a forceps-guided tube exchanger as an alternative to the stylet to aid intubation with the GlideScope in patients undergoing anaesthesia, with a simulated difficult airway created by the application of a semi-rigid cervical collar. Data were analysed from 178 patients randomly assigned to undergo intubation using either the stylet (n = 88) or a forceps-guided tube exchanger (n = 90). All intubations were completed successfully, with first attempt rates of 93.2% using the stylet and 94.4% using the exchanger (p = 0.597). The mean (SD) intubation time was 67.8 (28.7) s in the stylet group and 66.1 (15.5) s in the forceps-guided tube exchanger group (p = 0.11). The frequency of sore throat 1 h after extubation was 34.1% in the stylet group and 2.2% in the tube exchanger group (p < 0.001); 24 h after extubation the corresponding figures were 40.0% and 11.1% (p < 0.001).

Various measurements of the head and neck were made in an attempt to discover which features were associated with difficulty with laryngoscopy (defined as the inability to see even the arytenoids). In addition 38 patients, reported by colleagues because they had been ""difficult to intubate"", were measured. Five useful risk factors, measured at three levels of severity, were identified. A simple predictive rule was developed and tested on a prospective set of 778 patients, in 1.5% of whom laryngoscopy was found to be difficult. Depending on the threshold chosen, the rule allowed the detection of, for example, 75% of the ""difficult"" laryngoscopies at a cost of falsely identifying 12% of the ""not difficult"" patients.",1,1
9112553,A peel away sheath endoscopic technique for difficult pediatric urethral intubation problems,"Purpose: We describe a useful technique for overcoming difficult pediatric urethral intubation problems. Materials and methods: An 8F pediatric urethroscope is passed through a peel away sheath, advanced through the urethra into the bladder and removed. An 8F urethral catheter is passed, the balloon is inflated and the peel away sheath is removed. Results: This procedure has been performed in 6 children with difficult urethral problems without complication and with universal success. Conclusions: The peel away sheath technique offers a more reliable and less traumatic mechanism for difficult infant urethral intubation.",0,0
19284127,[Combined regional-general anesthesia with use of the Proseal laryngeal mask during prolonged peripheral plastic surgery],"The ProSeal laryngeal mask offers a better interface for controlled ventilation than does a traditional mask because of the ProSeal's improved airway seal and the possibility of draining the digestive tract. Limb reconstructive surgery is normally a long procedure involving the use of grafts or flaps located at a distance from the lesion. Regional anesthesia is therefore of limited use. We report a series of 24 adult patients who underwent peripheral plastic surgery under combined regional and general intravenous anesthesia and in whom the ProSeal mask was used. Data recorded included assessment of the airway and intubation difficulty, disease and duration of the procedure, type of regional anesthesia, respiratory and hemodynamic variables, patient satisfaction, laryngeal complications, and postoperative analgesia. All patients were adequately ventilated. One episode of bradycardia was controlled with atropine. In the immediate postoperative period, no patient presented laryngeal complications and only 1 patient reported significant pain (8 on a visual analog scale). The ProSeal mask was a good choice for use with combined regional-general anesthesia, ensuring control of the airway without causing complications. Analgesia was adequate in most cases.",0,0
20063135,Optimal remifentanil dose for laryngeal mask airway insertion when co-administered with a single standard dose of propofol,"Purpose: This dose-response study aimed to determine the optimal dose of remifentanil combined with propofol 2.5 mg.kg(-1) iv in order to achieve excellent conditions for laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion in 95% of adult female patients. Methods: Sixty-eight adult premedicated female patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II requiring anesthesia for ambulatory surgery, were randomly allocated to one of four remifentanil dose groups (0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 microg.kg(-1)). Induction of anesthesia was achieved with one of the four blinded doses of remifentanil infused over 60 sec and simultaneously co-administered with propofol 2.5 mg.kg(-1) iv infused over 45 sec. Insertion of the LMA was attempted 150 sec after the beginning of the induction sequence. Insertion conditions were assessed using a six-category score according to resistance to mouth opening and insertion, swallowing, coughing and gagging, movement, and laryngospasm. A probit analysis was performed to calculate the effective dose for insertion of the LMA in 95% of patients (efficient dose [ED](95)). The changes in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in response to LMA insertion were recorded and compared as secondary outcome variables. Results: The ED(95) of remifentanil was 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-2.46) microg.kg(-1). Changes in heart rate and mean arterial pressure were modest and similar over time across groups, with maximum decreases in heart rate and mean arterial pressure < 30% each during induction of anesthesia. Conclusions: The required dose of remifentanil is 1.32 (95% CI 0.99-2.46) microg.kg(-1) to achieve excellent LMA insertion conditions in 95% of patients when co-administered with propofol 2.5 mg.kg(-1) in healthy premedicated female patients undergoing elective ambulatory surgery.",0,0
21394611,"The nasomaxillary complex, the mandible, and sleep-disordered breathing","Purpose: This study aims to use clinical scales in a standardized fashion in evaluating the frequency of a high and narrow hard palate and/or small and retroplaced mandible in children with polysomnographically demonstrated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Methods: This is a retrospective review of clinical and polysomnographic data from children (2-17 years old) with SDB. Exclusion criteria were obesity, presence of a syndromic disorder, and incomplete chart information. Data on demographics, reason for referral, sleep history, Mallampati scale, size of the tonsils (Friedman scale), bite occlusion (dental positioning), and correlating clinical presentation and comparative physical exam of nasomaxillary and mandibular features (using subjective grading scales) were collected, as were results of pre- and post- treatment polysomnography. Results: Data from 400 children were analyzed. With increasing age, fewer referrals were made for abnormal breathing during sleep and more were made for daytime impairment and generally poor sleep. There were 290 children (72.6%) who had tonsils graded 3+ or 4+, but 373 (93.3%) had craniofacial features considered to be risk factors for SDB, including small mandible and/or high and narrow hard palate associated with a narrow nasomaxillary complex. Mean pretreatment apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 14.6 ± 17.1 and AHI was similar in the three age groups. Initial treatment was adenotonsillectomy. Follow-up was obtained in 378 subjects, and 167 cases demonstrated residual AHI. Incomplete response to adenotonsillectomy was seen more often in children with Mallampati scale scores of 3 and 4. Conclusion: Non-obese children with SDB had different initial clinical complaints based on age. Independently of age, facial anatomic structures limiting nasal breathing and those considered to be risk factors for SDB were commonly seen in the total group. Clinical assessment of craniofacial features considered as risk factors for SDB and more particularly a Mallampati scale score of 3 or 4 can be useful in identifying children who may be more at risk for limited response to adenotonsillectomy, suggesting a subsequent need for post-surgery polysomnography.",0,0

26669069,The BVM Effect. An overview of studies assessing airway management in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"Numerous studies addressing airway management in OHCA have shown a strong association between improved survival with treatment using BVM alone rather than with advanced airways. This BVM effect appears to persist despite variations in geographical region, patient population, and CPR quality. The underlying cause of this phenomenon remains to be determined. Of note, the survival benefit with BVM alone vs. advanced airways doesn't appear in the pediatric population in the papers reviewed by the authors. The authors recommend that a prospective randomized study be conducted in order to explore this finding and to attempt to determine its causation.",0,0

11736780,Prediction of prolonged laryngoscopy,"Duration of laryngoscopy must be kept as short as possible to prevent disturbances of oxygenation and ventilation. Because the factors associated with prolonged laryngoscopy are not well known, we studied 1000 patients undergoing tracheal intubation under general anaesthesia to determine the possible effects of their characteristics on the incidence of prolonged laryngoscopy (defined as lasting longer than 15 s). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the odds ratio for significant factors. Prolonged laryngoscopy occurred in 158 patients (15.8%). Six characteristics were determined as risk factors for a prolonged laryngoscopy: weight > 80 kg [OR 3.7 (95% CI 1.9-7.1)]; tongue protrusion < 3.2 cm [OR 2.0 (1.0-4.2)]; mouth opening < 5 cm [OR 4.3 (2.1-8.9)]; upper incisor length > 1.5 cm [OR 4.2 (2.0-8.6)]; Mallampati class > 1 [OR 10.0 (7.1-14.6)]; and head extension < 70 degrees [OR 7.1 (3.8-13.6)].

23634563,Interobserver variability for non-invasive prediction of difficult intubation in different years of anesthesiology residency,"Background: The incidence of a difficult laryngoscopy/intubation, which could lead to failed intubation is in the range of 1.5%-13%. Failed intubation may lead to hypoxia, brain damage or death. Preoperative evaluation of the airway can be accomplished by non-invasive bedside clinical tests during physical examination. We studied interobserver variability for non-invasive prediction of difficult intubation in different anesthesiology residency years. Methods: Three hundred eighty four adult patients undergoing elective surgery with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation were enrolled this study. The investigators were divided in to two groups: three of them were in 4th (Group 1) and the other three were in 1st (Group 2) year of their anesthesiology residency. The variables evaluated were age, weight, height, submental-cervical angle, measurements of mandibular space, deviation of trachea, jaw-hyomental distance, swelling or scar tissue at neck, limited mouth opening, small mouth cavity, macroglossia, cleft lip-palate, long teeth and modified Mallampati score. Results: The incidence of difficult intubation is 4.9%. Group 1 is more successful than Group 2 in predicting difficult intubation. Conclusions: Regarding Mallampati score, measurements of mandibular space, jaw-hyomental distance, mouth opening and mouth cavity; interobserver variability is detected in predicting difficult intubation among different years of anesthesiology residency. In means of submental-cervical angle, tracheal deviation, swelling or scar tissue at neck and macroglossia, similar results which are statistically significant, are obtained.",0,0

19218691,Induced sputum in patients with interstitial lung disease: a non-invasive surrogate for certain parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,"Induced sputum is a useful non-invasive method for the assessment of airway and parenchymal lung diseases. This study aimed to compare induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellular composition and T-lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with interstitial lung disease. We evaluated 33 patients: 15 with sarcoidosis, 11 with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and 7 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The percentage of macrophages was significantly lower in induced sputum than in BALF in sarcoidosis (P=0.005), and the percentage of neutrophils was higher in induced sputum than in BALF in sarcoidosis (P=0.001) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (P=0.006). A significant correlation was found between the BALF and induced sputum CD4+, CD8+ subsets and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in both the whole patient group (r(s)=0.80, r(s)=0.88, r(s)=0.88, P<0.001, respectively) and in the 3 subgroups. A strong correlation of the T-lymphocyte subsets in induced sputum and BALF in patients with interstitial lung disease shows that induced sputum may be a non-invasive surrogate for certain parameters in BALF in these patients.",0,0
8590489,The triple airway manoeuvre for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway in paralyzed patients,"The efficacy of the triple airway manoeuvre (mouth opening, head extension and jaw thrust) for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was compared with the standard insertion method. One hundred paralyzed patients were allocated randomly into two groups: in the control group (n = 50) the LMA was inserted by the standard method, and in the other (TAM group, n = 50) by the triple airway manoeuvre. In ten patients of each group, the position of the LMA and the epiglottis was assessed radiographically before insertion, after insertion but before cuff inflation, and after cuff inflation. In all patients the position was examined using fibrescopy before and after cuff inflation. The mean distance between the epiglottis and the posterior pharyngeal wall, measured radiographically before LMA insertion, was greater in the TAM group (16.3 (SD 4.3) mm) than in the control group (7.0 (2.8) mm) (P < 0.001). Before cuff inflation, radiography and fibrescopy showed that the LMA compressed the epiglottis downwards more frequently in the control group. After cuff inflation the glottis was completely visible fibreoptically in 66% in the TAM group, compared with 14% in the control group (P < 0.001). Complete downfolding of the epiglottis was seen in 10% in the control group and none in the TAM group (P < 0.05). We conclude that in paralyzed patients LMA insertion with the triple airway manoeuvre provides wider pharyngeal space and decreases the incidence of epiglottic downfolding by the LMA compared with the standard method.",0,0
9476856,Direct assessment of small airways reactivity in human subjects,"Our knowledge of airways reactivity to inflammatory agonists is derived predominantly from tests dominated by large airway responsiveness. To determine directly, the histamine responsiveness of the smallest airways, eight normal and 11 asymptomatic asthmatic subjects were studied utilizing a wedged bronchoscope technique. A fiberoptic bronchoscope was wedged in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and a double-lumen catheter was advanced through the working channel to its tip. With a constant flow of gas (5% CO2 in air) through one lumen of the catheter, pressure at the tip of the bronchoscope was measured with the subject breath-holding at FRC. Peripheral airways resistance (Rp) was measured at baseline and after saline, histamine (10, 50, 100 mg/ml) and isoproterenol (2 mg/ml) challenge through the bronchoscope. Baseline Rp of asthmatics (0.041 +/- 0.015 cm H2O/ml/min; mean +/- SE) was significantly greater than normal subjects (0.011 +/- 0.003 cm H2O/ml/min; p = 0.019). The log of the concentration of histamine that caused a 100% increase in peripheral airways response was greater in the normal subjects than in the asthmatic subjects (p = 0.0114) and correlated with whole lung responsiveness to histamine in asthmatics (r = 0.847, p < 0.05). Isoproterenol reversed completely the increase in Rp in normal subjects but not asthmatic subjects. The results of this study demonstrate that the resistance of the smallest peripheral airways, when measured directly, increased when challenged locally with histamine in both normal subjects and asthmatic subjects. However, the peripheral airways responsiveness was significantly enhanced in asthmatic subjects relative to normal controls.",0,0
21564049,A randomised controlled trial comparing the McGrath(®) videolaryngoscope with the straight blade laryngoscope when used in adult patients with potential difficult airways,"Studies show that both straight blade laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy can improve the view of the larynx when compared with the Macintosh blade laryngoscopy. However, no study has compared these two devices. A total of 80 patients with Mallampati grade ≥ 3 were randomly assigned to either have orotracheal intubation with the McGrath(®) videolaryngoscope or the Henderson straight blade. The primary outcome was laryngoscopic view. Time to intubation, number of attempts, ease of intubation and complications were also recorded. Thirty-nine out of 40 patients had grade-1 views in the McGrath group, compared with 29 out of 40 cases in the Henderson group (p = 0.003). There were no statistically significant differences in the secondary outcomes. Two patients suffered from minor oropharyngeal injuries in the Henderson group. Apart from offering significantly more grade-1 laryngoscopic views, the McGrath videolaryngoscope did not improve other clinical outcomes compared with the straight blade, when used in patients with poor Mallampati scores.",0,0
20642995,GlideScope video laryngoscope-assisted tongue base radiofrequency for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea: pilot study,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the advantages and feasibility of using the GlideScope video laryngoscope (GSVL) (Saturn Biomedical Systems, Burnaby, BC) in radiofrequency tongue base reduction for patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Methods: Patients suffering from mild to severe OSAS associated with predominant tongue base obstruction (grade 3-4 Mallampati score) confirmed with physical examination who applied to our clinic during the first half of 2007 were included in our study. Seven-watt bipolar radiofrequency was applied to each patient's tongue base assisted by the GSVL at five to seven different locations for 30 to 35 seconds, resulting in energy application in a range of 210 to 245 J. All operations were carried out by the same surgeon, and patients were observed for 15 days postoperatively for any complications. Results: Twelve patients were included in our study. Six of our patients were male and the other six were female. Each patient underwent a session of GSVL-assisted tongue base radiofrequency with a mean energy application of 210 to 245 J via five to seven punctures. The use of the GSVL assisted in a more thorough observation of tongue base anatomy, which aided in our aim to avoid the neurovascular bundle. The use of the GSVL during tongue base radiofrequency surgery creates a safer operation site and allows the surgeon to feel more confident during the procedure. The fact that we encountered no postoperative complications endorses our theory. Conclusion: The use of the GSVL in tongue base radiofrequency application not only creates a safer operative site and makes the procedure more uncomplicated but also could be an effective method that could be used in teaching hospitals for the education of otolaryngology surgeons regarding the tongue base radiofrequency procedure.",0,0
8758162,Optimal shape of the laryngeal mask cuff: the influence of three deflation techniques,"A randomised, single-blinded, controlled trial was conducted to determine if a new laryngeal mask deflation tool offered any advantages over manual or free deflation. Ten laryngeal mask airways were tested and the deflation tool provided a significantly superior and more consistent shape than either hand manipulation or the free deflation, but did not offer any benefits in terms of residual volume. The deflator tool should encourage wider use of the standard recommended insertion technique. It can be used as a backup when manual deflation cannot provide the correct shape and may be useful for researchers studying laryngeal mask airway placement.",0,0
9245215,[The Mallampati Score. Prediction of difficult intubation in otolaryngologic laser surgery by Mallampati Score],"The Mallampati score (MS), later modified by Samsoon and Young, is a common method used to predict difficult intubation. We tested its predictive value in otolaryngologic (ENT) laser surgery. Methods: Ninety-one patients scheduled for elective ENT laser surgery had the modified MS noted prior to induction in the supine position, with the tongue fully protruded and phonating ""ah""; 22 patients were female, 69 male. The mean age was 54 +/- 15 (6-84) years, height 171 +/- 9 (130-190) cm, and weight 72 +/- 21 (20-99) kg. After a standard induction, the laryngoscopic view was graded according to Cormack and Lehane (C&L). An intubation was considered difficult if the C&L score was > or = 3, i.e., no part of the glottis seen during laryngoscopy. The hypothesis tested was that a MS > or = 3 (i.e., only the base of the uvula or nine of the uvula was seen) is predictive of difficult intubation in this group of patients. This chi-square test was used for calculation of significance. Results: All intubations were performed in less than three attempts, and no C&L score of 4 (i.e., not even the epiglottis seen during laryngoscopy) was observed; 10 patients had a C&L score > or = 3, i.e., a difficult intubation according to our definition. Sixty-two patients had a MS < or = 2; of these, 4 (= 6%) were difficult to intubate. Twenty-nine patients had MS > or = 3; of these, 6 (= 21%) were difficult to intubate. This difference was significant (chi-square = 4.1, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Difficult intubation was significantly more common in patients with MS > or = 3. Low sensitivity (60%) and specificity (72%) limit the clinical value of this test, however.",1,1

Design: Case series with chart review. Setting: Tertiary care pediatric hospital. Children: One hundred ten children 3 years of age or younger who underwent adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy along with a full-airway evaluation that included flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy, direct laryngoscopy, and rigid bronchoscopy for SDB from January 2003 to January 2009. Outcome measures: Prevalence of SALs and rate of SALs that required intervention. Results: Sixty-seven percent of children were found to have at least 1 SAL. Four children required surgical intervention for a SAL. There was no significant difference in preoperative respiratory distress index (RDI) between children with normal airway examinations compared with children with a SAL. There was no significant difference in the rate of SALs between children younger than 18 months old and those 18 to 36 months old. Conclusions: There is a high incidence of SALs in children younger than 3 years old with SDB. There was no significant difference in the rate of SALs in children younger than 18 months old compared with children 18 to 36 months old. The RDI determined by a polysomnography was not predictive of the presence of a SAL. Tracheal cobblestoning was the most common SAL discovered.",0,0
8199754,The management of epiglottitis in a small paediatric intensive care unit,"The aim of this study was to examine the outcome of epiglottitis in a small paediatric institution. Over the 5 year period October 1986 to September 1991, 44 children (of whom 15 were retrieved) with epiglottitis were admitted to the only paediatric intensive care facility in the Hunter Region. The so-called classical features were often absent. Forty of the 44 children were intubated. The mean length of intubation was 22 h and the mean length of hospital stay was only 2 1/2 days. One child had a respiratory arrest prior to intubation but made a complete recovery; one child had a coexistent submental/submandibular fascial space infection; 16 (36%) had abnormal chest radiographs. Five children had post-extubation stridor with one of these children left with residual hoarseness.

23327043,Airway management in submandibular abscess patient with awake fibreoptic intubation--a case report,"Securing the airway is a core skill in anaesthesia, the gold standard of which is tracheal intubation. Normally this is achieved after induction of anaesthesia. However, some circumstances demand an awake approach. Skilful airway management is critical in deep neck space infections. There is currently no universal agreement on the ideal method of airway control for these patients because this depends on various factors including available local expertise and equipment. Compromised airway is still a challenge to the anesthesiologist in spite of all modalities available. Any flaw in airway management may lead to grave morbidity and mortality. We present a morbidly obese case of submandibular abscess with difficult intubation underwent incision and drainage. Large facial [jaw] swelling, TRISMUS-limited mouth opening, edema, protruding teeth and altered airway anatomy makes airway management more difficult. The case was further complicated by morbid obesity. Chances of rupture of abscess intraorally and aspiration under GA is a major threat. During GA, there is no change in mouth opening and loss of airway under muscle relaxation, ""difficult to ventilate, difficult to intubate"" makes these cases most challenging. On the basis of our experience case was successfully intubated by awake fibreoptic intubation.",0,0
25803435,Laryngoscope and a new tracheal tube assist lightwand intubation in difficult airways due to unstable cervical spine,"Purpose: The WEI Jet Endotracheal Tube (WEI JET) is a new tracheal tube that facilitates both oxygenation and ventilation during the process of intubation and assists tracheal intubation in patients with difficult airway. We evaluated the effectiveness and usefulness of the WEI JET in combination with lightwand under direct laryngoscopy in difficult tracheal intubation due to unstable cervical spine. Methods: Ninety patients with unstable cervical spine disorders (ASA I-III) with general anaesthesia were included and randomly assigned to three groups, based on the device used for intubation: lightwand only, lightwand under direct laryngoscopy, lightwand with WEI JET under direct laryngoscopy. Results: No statistically significant differences were detected among three groups with respect to demographic characteristics and C/L grade. There were statistically significant differences between three groups for overall intubation success rate (p = 0.015) and first attempt success rate (p = 0.000). The intubation time was significantly longer in the WEI group (110.8±18.3 s) than in the LW group (63.3±27.5 s, p = 0.000) and DL group (66.7±29.4 s, p = 0.000), but the lowest SpO2 in WEI group was significantly higher than other two groups (p<0.01). The WEI JET significantly reduced successful tracheal intubation attempts compared to the LW group (p = 0.043). The severity of sore throat was similar in three groups (p = 0.185). Conclusions: The combined use of WEI JET under direct laryngoscopy helps to assist tracheal intubation and improves oxygenation during intubation in patients with difficult airway secondary to unstable spine disorders.

7618711,Predicting difficult endotracheal intubation in surgical patients scheduled for general anesthesia: a prospective blind study,"We conducted a prospective, blind study to determine whether a difficult endotracheal intubation could be predicted preoperatively by evaluation of one or more anatomic features of the head. In 471 adults presenting for elective surgery, the size of the tongue relative to the oral cavity was assessed according to the Mallampati classification (oropharyngeal class), and the distance between the chin and thyroid cartilage (thyromental distance) and the angle at full extension of the head (head extension) were measured. At laryngoscopy, the difficulty in visualizing the larynx was determined by a different observer. Assignment to oropharyngeal Class 3, a thyromental distance < or = 7 cm, and a head extension < or = 80 degrees, considered either alone or in various combinations, had low sensitivity and positive predictive values in identifying patients with airways that were difficult to intubate, but high specificity and negative predictive values. We conclude that these three tests are of little value in predicting difficult intubation in adults, although the likelihood of an easy endotracheal intubation is high when they yield negative results.",1,1
9281230,"[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation already in Egypt 5,000 years ago?]","In light of the medically relevant features of the ancient Egyptian mouth-opening ceremony, the question of the effectiveness of medical practices in Egypt thousands of years ago is examined, whereby the religious and cultural framework also plays a significant role. In the Land on the Nile myth and reality clearly generated special conditions which favoured the systematic treatment of questions of resuscitation. Numerous examples show that this had practical consequences in the area of everyday medicine. In addition, rebirth and resurrection were central elements of the cult of the dead which had exact medical equivalents. These equivalents may demonstrate the advanced state of resuscitation practices in Egypt at that time. In this context, a reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian mouth-opening instrument is presented. In the cult of the dead, this instrument played a role which can be compared to the function of a modern laryngoscope. It appears possible that at the time of the pyramids the Egyptians already had an understanding of the technology required to perform instrument-aided artificial respiration. Whether or not they actually possessed a fundamental knowledge of the principles of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation remains unclear. Nevertheless, the astonishingly functional characteristics of the reconstructed mouth-opening instrument suggest that it was developed for more than purely symbolic purposes.",0,0
15845702,Cannot intubate-cannot ventilate and difficult intubation strategies: results of a Canadian national survey,"The purpose of this study was to determine the preferences of Canadian anesthesiologists in difficult intubation and cannot intubate-cannot ventilate (CICV) situations. Using a mailed survey, we asked anesthesiologists their preferences for and comfort level in using (a) alternative airway devices in a difficult intubation scenario and (b) infraglottic airway in a CICV scenario. Chi-square analysis and Student's t-test were used for categorical and continuous variables. Nine-hundred-seventy-one of 2066 surveys were returned. In the difficult intubation scenario, the preferred alternative airway devices were lighted stylet (45%), fiberoptic bronchoscope (26%), and intubating laryngeal mask airway (20%). Only 57% of respondents had encountered a CICV situation in real life. In the CICV scenario, preferred infraglottic airways were cricothyroidotomy by IV catheter (51%), percutaneous cricothyroidotomy (28%), and tracheostomy by surgeon (14%). Anesthesiologists had little experience and were uncomfortable with open surgical infraglottic airways. Anesthesiologists with experience using infraglottic airways on mannequins were more comfortable using them in patients (P < 0.001). In conclusion, in a difficult intubation scenario, the lighted stylet has emerged as the preferred alternative airway device.

27276783,LARYNGEAL CHONDROSARCOMA: SUCCESSFUL USE OF VIDEO LARYNGOSCOPE IN ANTICIPATED DIFFICULT AIRWAY MANAGEMENT,"Laryngeal chondrosarcoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor, most frequently affecting cricoid cartilage. The objective of this report is to present successful video laryngoscope usage in a patient with anticipated difficult airway who refused awake fiberoptic endotracheal intubation (AFOI). A 59-year-old male patient was admitted in our hospital due to difficulty breathing and swallowing. On clinical examination performed by ENT surgeon, preoperative endoscopic airway examination (PEAE) could not be performed properly due to the patient's uncooperativeness. Computed tomography revealed a spherical tumor that obstructed the subglottic area almost entirely. Due to the narrowed airway, the first choice for the anticipated difficult airway management was AFOI, which the patient refused. Consequently, we decided to perform endotracheal intubation with indirect laryngoscope using a C-MAC video laryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Reinforced endotracheal tube (6.0 mm internal diameter) was placed gently between the tumor mass and the posterior wall of the trachea in the first attempt. Confirmation of endotracheal intubation was done by capnography. In a patient with subglottic area chondrosarcoma refusing PEAE and AFOI, video laryngoscope is a particularly helpful device for difficult airway management when difficult airway is anticipated.",0,0
17874622,[The evaluation of the effectiveness of uvulopalatopharyngoplasy in the treatment of selected patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea--one year of postoperative follow up],"The uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is one the most commonly used surgical procedure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients. The effectiveness of this procedure in a group of unselected patients is estimated on about 40%. Aim of the study: To assess the efficacy of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in the treatment of mild and moderate OSA patients, qualified for the study by simple clinical criteria, one year after UPPP. One year postoperative results were also compared with the early results obtained 4-6 months postoperatively. Material and methods: 20 patients who meet the following criteria: respiratory disturbance index RDI <30, body mass index BMI<30, collar size <43 cm, tongue size - I and II grade in modified Mallampati scale were qualified for the study. The first examination of breathing disturbances during sleep was performed 4-6 months after the operation and the second after 12 to 14 months of follow up. Results: The first control examination revealed at least 50% reduction of RDI in 75% of patients, and RDI dropped below 10 in 60%. One year postoperatively the reduction of RDI by at last 50% was maintained in 60% of patients, and RDI dropped below 10 in 40% of cases. The mean RDI decreased from 21.35 preoperatively to 9.85 in the first control examination and subsequently slightly increased to 10.25 after one year of follow up. Conclusions: Application of simple clinical criteria to patients' qualification for UPPP slightly improved the effectiveness of this type of surgical procedure. Regular control examinations of breathing disorders during sleep seem to be necessary, due to possible deterioration of the early postoperative results, in order to detect therapeutic failure and eventually apply other form of treatment.",0,0
12401640,The reliability of the Bellhouse test for evaluating extension capacity of the occipitoatlantoaxial complex,"We examined the reliability of an airway evaluation test to assess the occipitoatlantoaxial (OAA) extension capacity described by Bellhouse et al. (Bellhouse test) in 20 adult volunteers with normal cervical spines. Each subject sat upright with the head in the neutral position and was then asked to extend the head maximally while attempting to move the neck as little as possible. The angle from the neutral position to the extreme extension was measured using the goggle-goniometer. Lateral cervical radiographs were taken in these positions, and the OAA extension angle was radiographically measured. Median values for OAA extension measured radiographically and extension of the head measured with the Bellhouse test were 21.5 degrees and 30 degrees, respectively. Extension of 9.5 degrees occurred at the subaxial regions, which could not be detected by inspecting surface contours of the neck. The extent of the subaxial extension was almost consistent with the degree of overestimation of the OAA extension capacity by the Bellhouse test. Because the subaxial extension occurred independent of the degree of the OAA extension, a strong relationship between the angle measured with the goggle-goniometer and the OAA extension angle measured radiographically was not established (P < 0.01, r(2) = 0.44). These findings mean that the test is not always accurate to evaluate the OAA extension capacity and will fail to detect a reduction of the OAA extension capacity if the subaxial regions are normal. Therefore, these problems derived from the Bellhouse test offer a potential for missing a prediction of difficult tracheal intubations because reduced OAA extension is one of the important factors that make intubation difficult. Implications: The Bellhouse test was not always accurate to evaluate the actual occipitoatlantoaxial extension capacity because of the inevitable occurrence of the subaxial extension. This may mean that some difficult endotracheal intubations will be unpredictable.",0,0
2119152,Flumazenil reverses sedation after midazolam-induced general anesthesia in ambulatory surgery patients,"Flumazenil, a specific competitive benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated for reversal of residual sedation after midazolam-induced ambulatory general anesthesia. Endotracheal anesthesia was begun with midazolam (mean +/- SD dose 12.4 +/- 2.4 mg), followed by nitrous oxide in oxygen, fentanyl, and succinylcholine, for gynecologic surgery lasting 38.6 +/- 12.5 min. After surgery, 29 women were given repeated injections of small amounts of either flumazenil or placebo until awake and calm. The mean flumazenil dose was 0.83 +/- 0.04 mg. Assessment of recovery was based on psychodiagnostic tests (visual analog sedation scale, Trieger dot, digit symbol substitution), pulse oxygen saturation, and end-expired carbon dioxide tension. Patients given flumazenil scored significantly better than did those given placebo on the psychodiagnostic tests for 5-60 min, but the groups were no longer different 120 and 180 min after the conclusion of surgery. All scores did not return to preoperative values by 180 min. Pulse oxygen saturation and end-expired carbon dioxide tension showed improvement from postoperative levels at 15 min after flumazenil injection. A controllable degree of midazolam reversal was achieved with flumazenil, but the duration of reversal was limited. Caution is needed to avoid premature discharge of ambulatory patients after midazolam-induced general anesthesia during the time that flumazenil is effective.",0,0
23394837,"Water exchange enhanced cecal intubation in potentially difficult colonoscopy. Unsedated patients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial","Background: Colonoscopy is widely used for management of colorectal diseases. A history of abdominal or pelvic surgery is a well-recognized factor associated with difficult colonoscopy. Although water exchange colonoscopy (WEC) was effective in small groups of male U.S. veterans with such a history, its application in other cultural settings is uncertain. Objective: To investigate the application of WEC in such patients. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, patient-blinded study. Setting: Tertiary-care referral center in China. Patients: Outpatients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery undergoing unsedated diagnostic, screening, or surveillance colonoscopy. Intervention: Patients were randomized to examination by either WEC or conventional air colonoscopy (AC). Main outcome measurements: Cecal intubation rate. Results: A total of 110 patients were randomized to the WEC (n = 55) or AC (n = 55) group. WEC significantly increased the cecal intubation rate (92.7% vs 76.4%; P = .033). The maximum pain scores (± standard deviation) were 2.1 ± 1.8 (WEC) and 4.6 ± 1.7 (AC), respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis showed that the colonoscopy method was the only independent predictor of failed colonoscopy (odds ratio 11.44, 95% confidence interval, 1.35-97.09). A higher proportion of patients examined by WEC would be willing to have a repeat unsedated colonoscopy (90.9% vs 72.7%, P = .013). Limitations: Single center; unblinded but experienced endoscopists. Conclusion: This randomized, controlled trial confirms that the water exchange method significantly enhanced cecal intubation in potentially difficult colonoscopy in unsedated patients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery. The lower pain scores and higher proportion accepting repeat of the unsedated option suggest that WEC is promising. It may enhances compliance with colonoscopy in specific populations.

12859303,Use of the laryngeal tube in 100 patients,"Background: The laryngeal tube has a potential role during anaesthesia, but there have been only a few studies assessing its efficacy during the entire course of anaesthesia, and all previous studies used prototypes. We studied 100 patients to assess the efficacy of a new laryngeal tube during the entire course of anaesthesia. Methods: After induction of anaesthesia, the laryngeal tube was inserted (up to two times) and adequacy of ventilation was assessed. The airway pressure at which gas leaked around the device was measured. The device was used during anaesthesia, while ventilation was controlled. The device was removed after the patient had opened the mouth to verbal command. Any complications during and after anaesthesia were recorded. Results: Ventilation was possible at the first attempt in 90 patients, at the second attempt in another seven patients, and adequate ventilation failed after two attempts in three patients. Median (interquartile range) leak pressure was 28 (22-30) cmH2O. In all 97 patients, the laryngeal tube was used until the end of surgery. However, in two of the 97 patients the airway was partially obstructed during anaesthesia and it was necessary to reposition the device. The laryngeal tube was tolerated well during emergence from anaesthesia. No hypoxia, regurgitation, vomiting or laryngospasm occurred in any patient. On removal of the laryngeal tube, no blood was detected on the device and no apparent ischaemic changes to the tongue were observed in any patient. Post-operatively, six patients complained of a mild sore throat, and no patient complained of difficulty in swallowing or numbness of the oropharynx. Conclusion: The laryngeal tube can be useful for maintaining a patent airway during anaesthesia.",0,0

26052860,"Incidence of and risk factors for difficult ventilation via a supraglottic airway device in a population of 14,480 patients from South-East Asia","Difficult airway practice guidelines include the use of a supraglottic airway device as part of the armamentarium to provide and maintain ventilation and oxygenation. We retrospectively reviewed 14 480 patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent general anaesthesia. We identified 74 (0.5%) patients whose lungs were identified as having been difficult to ventilate via a supraglottic airway device, and 29 (0.2%) patients in whom device placement failed. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors for difficult ventilation via a supraglottic airway device: male sex (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.07-2.86, p = 0.02); age > 45 years (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.01-2.86, p = 0.04); short thyromental distance (OR 4.35, 95% CI 2.31-8.17, p < 0.001); and limited neck movement (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.02-7.44, p = 0.04). Adverse respiratory events including oxygen desaturation, hypercapnoea, laryngospasm, and bronchospasm occurred in 17 patients (22%).

7818203,[Proposal for a new multifactor screening score of difficult intubation in ORL and stomatognathic surgery: preliminary study],"This study assessed prospectively in 295 ENT adult patients the predictive value of clinical indicators for difficult intubation and of a new multifactorial score, established by the allocation of points (0, 3, 5 or 7) depending on the degree of presence of seven factors: pathology known to be associated with a difficult intubation, clinical signs of airways' pathology, inter-incisors gap and mandible's luxation, submental mandibular-thyroid distance, normal or short and broad neck, head and neck movements, and Mallampati's test. The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was 14% and the use of particular techniques for tube insertion was required in 8% of patients. The presence of malformation or pathology often associated with a difficult intubation and the presence of functional signs of airways' pathology predict the difficulties of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation with a good sensitivity and specificity. The analysis of the ""Receiver Operating Characteristic curves"" showed that a score higher or equal to 11 allows the prediction of difficult intubations with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 90%.",1,1
11037646,Intratracheal oxygen administration during bronchoscopy in newborns: comparison between two different weight groups of infants,"Background: The development of ultrathin fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) has made the examination of neonatal airways a practical possibility. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of intratracheal oxygen (ITO) administration on blood oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO2) changes during FB in different body-weight infants. Methods: Newborns suspected of having airway problems, but in a stable cardiopulmonary condition were studied. An ultrathin (outside diameter, 2.2 mm) fiberoptic bronchoscope that was modified by adding an external tube (internal diameter, 0.3 mm; outside diameter, 0.64 mm) to deliver oxygen was used. For ITO administration, a low oxygen flow rate of 0.1 l/kg/min was delivered directly into the trachea. Oxygenation and CO2 measurements were obtained at five different stages: 1) just before FB (baseline); 2) with the tip of the bronchoscope at the supralarynx; 3) with the tip at the carina without ITO; 4) with the tip at the carina with ITO; and 5) 15 minutes after FB. Forty infants were studied completely and divided into two groups according to their body weight: 1) the light-weight group (< 2,500 g), 21 infants; and 2) the heavy-weight group (> or = 2,500 g), 19 infants. Results: In both groups, arterial blood oxyhemoglobin saturation and oxygen tension decreased significantly (p < 0.05) when the tip of the bronchoscope advanced from the nostril to the supralarynx, and further decreased (p < 0.01) when at the carina level. Small infants had greater decrements of both oxygenation measurements (p < 0.05) than the large infants. After ITO administration, both oxygenation measurements increased significantly (p < 0.001) and returned to baseline following FB. Both end tidal pressure of CO2 (P(ET)CO2) and arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) significantly increased from the baseline when the FB tip was advanced from the supralarynx to the carina (p < 0.05). During ITO administration, the PaCO2 increased (p < 0.01) but the P(ET)CO2 decreased (p < 0.001). After FB, both CO2 measurements returned to baseline. The pH only decreased during ITO administration. Conclusions: We conclude that FB causes significant hypoxemia and hypercapnia in newborns, especially in underweight infants. Appropriate ITO can be considered a safe and beneficial technique for maintaining oxygenation during FB. P(ET)CO2 monitoring may mask true blood CO2 retention during ITO administration.",0,0

26968066,The role of polysomnography in tracheostomy decannulation of the paediatric patient,"Introduction: Tracheostomy decannulation in the paediatric patient is usually considered when there is resolution or significant improvement in the original indication for the tracheostomy. The child's cardiorespiratory function needs to be optimized and assessment of the readiness for decannulation is generally by endoscopic evaluation to confirm airway patency and vocal cord mobility. Functional airway assessment procedures include downsizing the tracheostomy, adding fenestration, speaking valves and capping the tracheostomy tube. Few objective measures have been demonstrated to accurately predict the likelihood of successful decannulation. This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of polysomnography (PSG) with a capped tracheostomy tube, as an adjunct to airway endoscopy and traditional decannulation procedures, to predict decannulation outcome. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted for patients who underwent ""capped"" PSG prior to a trial of tracheostomy decannulation at the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. The charts were reviewed for clinical data and PSG results. Results: 30 children with a total of 40 PSG reports were included in this study. There was a statistically significant difference in mean oxygen saturation, minimum oxygen saturation, total apnoea/hypopnoea index, desaturations >3%, and desaturations >3% index between those that had successful decannulation compared to failed decannulation. The measures with the greatest significance, and therefore, the best predictors of decannulation outcome were total apnoea/hypopnoea index (3.35events/h vs. 18.5events/h, p=0.004) and desaturation events (20.33 events vs. 192 events, p=0.001). Conclusions: PSG with a capped tracheostomy tube is a useful, objective tool to complement endoscopy and functional airway assessment in the consideration of decannulation in the paediatric population.",0,0
25457068,New clinical staging for pharyngeal surgery in obstructive sleep apnea patients,"Introduction: The success of pharyngeal surgery in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome depends on the appropriate selection of patients. Objective: To propose a new staging for indication of pharyngeal surgery in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Methods: A total of 54 patients undergoing extended tonsillectomy were retrospectively included, divided into six stages. Stage I: patients with palatine tonsils grade 3/4 and modified Mallampati index 1/2; stage II: palatine tonsils 3/4 and modified Mallampati index 3/4; stage III: palatine tonsils 1/2 and modified Mallampati index 1/2; stage IV: palatine tonsils 1/2 and modified Mallampati index 3/4; stage V: body mass index ≥40 kg/m(2) with palatine tonsils 3/4 and modified Mallampati index 1, 2, 3, or 4. Stage VI: body mass index ≥40 with palatine tonsils 1/2 and modified Mallampati index 1, 2, 3, or 4. Results: The surgical success rates were 88.9%, 75.0%, 35.7%, 38.5%, and 100.0% in stages I-V. Conclusion: The presence of hypertrophic palatine tonsils was the anatomical factor in common in the most successful stages (I, II, and V), regardless of body mass index. Although the modified Mallampati index classes 3 and 4 reduced the success rate of surgery in patients with hypertrophic tonsils (stage II), the presence of modified Mallampati index classes 1 and 2 did not favor surgical success in patients with normal tonsils (stage III).",0,0

10232724,The intubating laryngeal mask airway in failed fibreoptic intubation,"Purpose: Prediction of difficult tracheal intubation is not always reliable and management with fibreoptic intubation is not always successful. We describe two cases in which blind intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA FasTrach) succeeded after fibreoptic intubation failed. Clinical features: The first patient, a 50 yr old man, was scheduled for elective craniotomy for intracerebral tumour. Difficulty with intubation was not anticipated. Manual ventilation was easily performed following induction of general anesthesia, but direct laryngoscopy revealed only the tip of the epiglottis. Intubation attempts with a styletted 8.0 mm endotracheal tube and with the fibreoptic bronchoscope were unsuccessful. A #5 FasTrach was inserted through which a flexible armored cuffed 8.0 mm silicone tube passed into the trachea at the first attempt. The second patient, a 43 yr old man, presented with limited mouth opening, swelling of the right submandibular gland that extended into the retropharynx and tracheal deviation to the left. He was scheduled for urgent tracheostomy. Attempted awake fibreoptic orotracheal intubation under topical anesthesia showed gross swelling of the pharyngeal tissues and only fleeting views of the vocal cords. A #4 FasTrach was easily inserted, a clear airway obtained and a cuffed 8.0 mm silicone tube passed into the trachea at the first attempt. Conclusion: The FasTrach may facilitate blind tracheal intubation when fibreoptic intubation is unsuccessful.",0,0
22991808,[Unexpectedly complicated laryngoscopy caused by a massive mandibular tori],"Here, we report a case of an unexpectedly complicated laryngoscopy caused by massive mandibular tori. A 64-year-old man with mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation was scheduled for a double valve replacement. Thyromental distance and the Mallampati score were used as predictive factors of difficult intubation, and both factors were within the normal range. Anesthesia with controlled ventilation was started with fentanyl, propofol and vecuronium. After the attainment of full muscle relaxation, an experienced anesthesiologist performed direct laryngoscopy. It was not possible to intubate the patient under direct laryngoscopy because of massive mandibular tori which had not been detected prior to induction. Following the failure of direct laryngoscopy, a McCoy laryngoscope and a gum elastic bougie were deployed to improve vision. Intubation with a 7.5 mm tube was successful at the third attempt. We hope our experience will serve as a reminder to clinicians that mandibular tori, although benign and without subjective symptoms, could have significant effects upon direct laryngoscopy by compromising the line of vision.

16761887,"The Combitube, self-inflating bulb, and colorimetric carbon dioxide detector to advance airway management in the first echelon of the battlefield","Combat lifesavers and Army medics are regular combat soldiers who possess skills that enable them to provide lifesaving assistance to combat casualties. Although their training is not equal to that of paramedics, combat lifesavers and Army medics are trained to assess casualties for airway obstruction, as well as the presence or absence of spontaneous ventilation. They are also familiar with the same basic airway maneuvers that are required for blind insertion of the esophageal-tracheal double-lumen airway (ETDLA). Use of the ETDLA in combination with an esophageal detector device and a colorimetric carbon dioxide detector would require skill similar to that which they already possess in performing many mission-essential and combat lifesaver tasks. Because the U.S. Army has introduced the ETDLA for use, it is important that providers at all echelons understand the dynamics of the ETDLA. Inclusion of the ETDLA, esophageal detector device, and colorimetric carbon dioxide detector in combination with the bag-valve ventilation device could provide a viable alternative to mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing with the oral airway, as currently used by combat lifesavers on the battlefield. Improved airway management, in conjunction with other lifesaving measures, could potentially improve survival rates for combat casualties and assist in stabilizing them for evacuation to higher echelons of combat medical care.",0,0
21800666,[Anesthesia for three patients with Hunter syndrome],"Airway compromise is one of the greatest concerns in the anesthetic management in Hunter syndrome. We report anesthetic management of three cases of Hunter syndrome. The first was a 3-year-old boy scheduled for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted and fiberoptic intubation through the LMA was successfully performed. The second was a 23-year-old man with a past history of difficult intubation, scheduled for repair of femur neck fracture. He received lateral cutaneous nerve block and monitored anesthesia care using remifentanil. The third was a 53-year-old man scheduled for repair of giant inguinal hernia. Having failed regional (combined spinal and epidural) anesthesia, we administered general anesthesia with placement of a LMA.

18225630,Endotracheal intubation with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy in patients with abnormal anatomic conditions of the head and neck,"We performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate the indications for endotracheal intubation via flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy in patients who were scheduled for surgery or who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit of our 1100-bed, tertiary care university hospital. We reviewed 9201 clinical records of anesthetic procedures during which endotracheal intubation had been performed from January to December 2002. We identified 66 patients who had been intubated with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy. On preanesthetic examination, 61 of these patients had been found to be poor candidates for conventional laryngoscopic intubation-51 because of abnormal head and neck anatomy and 10 because of reduced visual access to the airway (Mallampati class IV). The remaining 5 patients were intubated via flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy after conventional intubation had failed during emergency surgery. Our study emphasizes (1) the importance of the preanesthetic examination of surgical patients, to identify those in whom conventional intubation would likely be problematic, and (2) the need to have fiberoptic bronchoscopes and an anesthesiologist or bronchoscopist skilled in their use available in operating suites and intensive care units.",0,0
24320857,An assessment of oropharyngeal airway position using a fibreoptic bronchoscope,"Selecting the appropriate oropharyngeal airway for safe and effective airway management is important in clinical practice. In this prospective observational study, we examined the position of the distal end of oropharyngeal airways using a fibreoptic bronchoscope. We enrolled 149 adults (72 men and 77 women). The correct airway size was determined by inserting four adult sizes Guedel airway (Hudson RCI; Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle, Park, NC, USA) (sizes 8, 9, 10 and 11) sequentially in anaesthetised patients. The 'best fit' airway was size 10 in 45 (62%) men, and size 9 in 58 (75%) women. However, when these airways were inserted, the distal end of the airway either touched or passed beyond the epiglottis tip in 20 (27%) men and six (8%) women, respectively. When a size-9 airway was inserted in men and a size-8 airway inserted in women, the distal ends were obstructed by the tongue in three (2%) patients. In conclusion, a size-9 airway in men and a size-8 airway in women are the most acceptable sizes for adults of average height.",0,0
24859287,Airway changes in pregnant women before and after delivery,"Aim: High incidence of difficult or failed intubation in obstetric patients is still a major problem to challenge anaesthesiologists. Although the probability of difficult intubation is impossible to predict preoperatively, some simple, practical bedside tests may help. This study used five simple tests in an attempt to better evaluate airway changes in pregnant women before and after delivery. Materials and methods: Pregnant women from the ASA I-II group who were planning to undergo a normal vaginal delivery were evaluated as to the possibility of experiencing difficult intubation. Mallampati scores, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, mouth opening, and the degree of neck extension were recorded just before delivery and 24 h after delivery. Results: Significant differences were seen in the pre- and post-delivery measurements (p < 0.05). Before delivery, Mallampati scores I, II, III, IV were 35, 24, 2, 0, respectively, and 24 h after delivery became 46, 15, 0, 0, respectively. Conclusions: Within 24 h after delivery, Mallampati scores changed in one-third (n 21, 36.6%) of the patients. Significant differences between the two measurements of thyromental and sternomental distances, mouth opening, and the degree of neck extension confirm difficult airway management in pregnant women.",0,0
20500608,Monitoring airway remodeling in asthma,"Introduction: Airway remodeling occurs in both mild and severe forms of asthma but, from a clinical point of view, airway remodeling in asthma is difficult to monitor. Objectives: The objective of this overview is to make an inventory of which methods could be possible to monitor airway remodeling in asthma. Methods: Access to airway tissue through biopsies or material from surgery enables direct assessment of airway remodeling but there are no specific inflammatory markers obtained from, for example, sputum, lavage fluid, blood, exhaled air, exhaled breath condensate, urine or saliva that reflect certain aspects of airway remodeling. Physiological measures such as changes in lung function and bronchial responsiveness over time co-varies with changes in airway structure but these interactions are complex and non-specific. Novel imaging techniques have shown promising results and recent studies have demonstrated how structural airway and lung changes can be detected on computerized tomography. Results and conclusion: Today, there are no available techniques for monitoring airway remodeling in daily clinical practice, but further development within this area and studies on co-variation between physiologic, inflammatory and visual abnormalities will likely enable us to better monitor airway remodeling in the future.",0,0
19775054,Arytenoid subluxation after a difficult intubation treated successfully with voice therapy,"Arytenoid subluxation is a rare laryngeal injury that may follow instrumentation of the airway and present as hoarseness, vocal fatigue, stridor, dysphagia, odynophagia and sore throat. We report the case of an 88-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed this complication during a difficult intubation where a Macintosh laryngoscope and gum elastic bougie were used to facilitate intubation. Previously considered to play a minor role in treatment, voice therapy was used successfully in this patient to correct subluxation of the arytenoid, with prompt resolution of his symptoms.",0,0
23333798,Wnt pathway contributes to the protection by bone marrow stromal cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and is a potential therapeutic target,"Leukemia cells are protected by various components of their microenvironment, including marrow stromal cells (MSCs). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this protection, we cultured acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with MSCs and studied the effect of the latter on the molecular profiling of ALL cells at the mRNA and protein levels. Our results indicated that activated Wnt signaling in ALL cells is involved in MSC-mediated drug resistance. Blocking the Wnt pathway sensitized the leukemia cells to chemotherapy and improved overall survival in a mouse model. Targeting the Wnt pathway may be an innovative approach to the treatment of ALL.",0,0
26647074,Relevance of radiological and clinical measurements in predicting difficult intubation using light wand (Surch-lite™) in adult patients,"Objective: To determine the correlation between anatomical features of the upper airway (evaluated via computed tomography imaging) and the ease of light wand-assisted endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery under general anaesthesia. Methods: Mallampati class, laryngoscopic grade, thyromental distance, neck circumference, body mass index, mouth opening and upper lip bite class were assessed. Epiglottis length and angle, tongue size and narrowest pharyngeal distance were determined using computed tomography imaging. Intubation success rate, time to successful intubation (intubating time) and postoperative throat symptoms were documented. Results: Of 152 patients, 148 (97.4%) were successfully intubated on the first attempt (mean intubating time 11.5 ± 6.7 s). Intubating time was positively correlated with laryngoscopic grade and body mass index in both male and female patients, and Mallampati class and neck circumference in male patients. Epiglottis length was positively correlated with intubating time. Conclusions: Ease of intubation was influenced by epiglottis length. Radiological evaluation may be useful for preoperative assessment of patients undergoing endotracheal intubation with light wand.",0,0
19713258,"A comparison of three videolaryngoscopes: the Macintosh laryngoscope blade reduces, but does not replace, routine stylet use for intubation in morbidly obese patients","Background: Many manufacturers are producing videolaryngoscopes (VLSs) with differing specifications, user interfaces, and geometry. It is clinically relevant to know the relative performance of the blades. Visualization of the glottis and intubation are often problematic in (extremely) obese patients, and the new video technology may offer better functionality and performance. Although many tracheal intubations with direct laryngoscopy are performed with an unstyletted endotracheal tube, it is recommended to use a stylet for intubation using videolaryngoscopy. In this study, we compared 3 VLSs in morbidly obese patients undergoing intubation for elective surgery and tested whether it is feasible to intubate the tracheas of morbidly obese patients without using a stylet. Methods: One hundred fifty consecutive adult morbidly obese patients (body mass index >35 kg/m(2)) were randomly selected to receive one of 3 VLSs: GlideScope, Storz V-Mac, and McGrath. Direct laryngoscopy scored the best possible view of the glottis; subsequently, the respective VLS was used, and the patient's trachea was intubated. Common preprocedural (e.g., Mallampati grade) and intraprocedural (Cormack-Lehane grade) metrics of intubation difficulty were measured, as well as the dependent variables of intubation time, number of attempts, and subjective difficulty. Results: All 3 VLSs tested offered an equal or better view of the glottis compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy. The number of attempts necessary to intubate the trachea differed significantly among VLSs (average 2.6 +/- 1.0 attempts for the GlideScope, 1.4 +/- 0.7 for the Storz, and 2.9 +/- 0.9 for the McGrath VLS). The average intubation times were 33 +/- 18 s for the GlideScope, 17 +/- 9 s for the Storz, and 41 +/- 25 s for the McGrath VLS. Conclusions: In this study, the VLS with the Macintosh blade (Storz VLS) had a better overall satisfaction score, intubation time, number of intubation attempts, and necessity of extra adjuncts, compared with the 2 other tested devices.",0,0
23453928,[Awake intubation using Pentax Airway Scope as an alternative to awake fiberoptic intubation in management of anticipated difficult tracheal intubation in major burn patients],"Intubating patients with facial burn is difficult to most anesthesiologists. Awake flexible fiberoptic intubation is the gold standard for management of anticipated difficult tracheal intubation. However, serious facial burn and dysmorphic syndrome can make fiberoptic intubation more difficult or impossible. We report the use of awake oral intubation using the Pentax-Airway Scope (AWS) in two major burn patients with facial injury, in whom awake fiberoptic intubation was impossible. As shown in morbidly obese patient and in patients with unstable necks, AWS could be useful to facilitate tracheal intubation in awake, facial burn patients presenting with a potentially difficult airway. Awake AWS intubation seems as a potential alternative to awake fiberoptic intubation.",0,0
24602459,Upper airway obstructions and chronic otitis media: a clinical study,"Purpose: To investigate if pathologies causing upper airway obstructions are correlated with chronic otitis media. Materials and methods: One hundred fourteen patients with chronic otitis media and 114 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Nasal septal deviation, Friedman and Mallampati scores were assessed for upper airway obstructions. Chronic suppurative otitis media was classified into tubotypmanic (n=80) and atticoantral (n=34) subtypes. Number of patients with septal deviation with a convexity to the same side as the affected ear in each CSOM subgroup was compared with chi-square test. The mean Mallampati and Friedman scores in tubotympanic disease group, atticoantral disease group and healthy controls were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Septal deviation occurred more frequently on the same side of ear pathology in patients with tubotympanic chronic suppurative otitis media (p=0.0005). Such a difference was not observed between the controls and patients with atticoantral chronic suppurative otitis media (p=0.718). No significant difference was noted between patients and controls in terms of Mallampati and Friedman scores (p=0.602 and p=0.836, respectively). Subtypes of chronic suppurative otitis media were not different from each other in terms of Mallampati and Friedman scores either (p=0.718 and p=0.708). Conclusion: Our results indicate that septal deviations may commonly occur on the same side with chronic otitis media. Therefore, septal deviations must be carefully investigated during the preoperative assessment of patients with CSOM. Elucidation of any possible causal relationship calls for further trials in larger series.",0,0

16439893,Total hip arthroplasty in children with juvenile chronic arthritis: long-term results,"From 1984 to 2002, 20 total hip arthroplasties in children with juvenile chronic arthritis were performed in the authors' department. All patients had polyarticular disease. Average age of patients was 15.8 (range 13-24) years. Early onset of the disease occurred at an average age of 7.3 (4-10) years. In six patients the physes were open at the time of surgery. All patients had complete loss of joint space and various combinations of subchondral sclerosis, flattening of the femoral head, and anterior inclination of the neck. All patients used crutches for walking and joint function was very restricted. All patients were operated on under general anesthesia. One of them was supported additionally with laryngeal mask because of cervical spine involvement. No intra- or postoperative complications occurred. Mobilization of the patients started immediately after surgery, followed by a special rehabilitation program. Follow-up examination was based on the Merle d'Aubigne et Postel scale as modified by Charnley. Patients were followed at 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery and thereafter every 6 months with clinical and radiologic examination. Average follow-up was 9.2 (2-20) years. All patients had no pain and full functional ability. Although total hip arthroplasty is technically difficult in this age, it should be performed in specialized centers because pain relief, decreased deformity, and improved quality of life can be achieved in most patients. The only disadvantage is wear of the prosthesis.",0,0
21743336,"Evaluation of the Bonfils intubating fibrescope for predicted difficult intubation in awake patients with ear, nose and throat cancer","Background and objective: Anaesthesiologists are regularly faced with difficult tracheal intubation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of tracheal intubation with the Bonfils intubating fibrescope in awake adult patients with predicted difficult intubation undergoing cancer surgery in an ear, nose and throat unit. Methods: Intubation was performed under local anaesthesia and remifentanil sedation with spontaneous ventilation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of intubations which met the following quality requirements: successful intubation (≤ 2 attempts and duration <180 s) and good tolerability (Fahey scale <2). Secondary endpoints included the operational problems encountered and patients' perception of the procedure immediately and 7 days after the intervention. Using a one-stage Fleming design, 32 patients were required to complete the study. Forty-one eligible adult patients were enrolled. Results: Between February 2008 and March 2009, the primary endpoint could be evaluated in 33 patients. Quality requirements were met in 26 patients (78.8%) and not met in seven patients (five were intubated with the Bonfils fibrescope and two using another technique). Difficulties were reported in 13 patients (39.4%). Eighty-four percent of the patients had a good or very good perception of the intubation shortly after the procedure, and 91% after 7 days. Conclusion: Tracheal intubation using the Bonfils intubating fibrescope was successful in almost all patients (93.9%). The 78.8% incidence of interventions which met the quality requirements is high in the context of ear, nose and throat cancer and acceptable in current clinical practice. In ear, nose and throat cancer patients who do not require nasopharyngeal intubation and in whom orotracheal intubation is predicted to be difficult, the use of the Bonfils intubating fibrescope is safe, effective and well tolerated.

23135259,Prediction of difficult tracheal intubation: time for a paradigm change,"Background: It has been suggested that predicting difficult tracheal intubation is useless because of the poor predictive capacity of individual signs and scores. The authors tested the hypothesis that an accurate prediction of difficult tracheal intubation using simple clinical signs is possible using a computer-assist model. Methods: In a cohort of 1,655 patients, the authors analyzed the predictive properties of each of the main signs (Mallampati score, mouth opening, thyromental distance, and body mass index) to predict difficult tracheal intubation. They built the best score possible using a simple logistic model (SCOREClinic) and compared it with the more recently described score in the literature (SCORENaguib). Then they used a boosted tree analysis to build the best score possible using computer-assisted calculation (SCOREComputer). Results: Difficult tracheal intubation occurred in 101 patients (6.1%). The predictive properties of each sign remain low (maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.70). Using receiver operating characteristic curve, the global prediction of the SCOREClinic (0.74, 95% CI: 0.72-0.76) was greater than that of the SCORENaguib (0.66, 95% CI: 0.60-0.72, P<0.001) but significantly lower than that of the SCOREComputer (0.86, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91, P<0.001). The proportion of patients in the inconclusive zone was 71% using SCORENaguib, 56% using SCOREClinic, and only 32 % using SCOREComputer (all P<0.001). Conclusion: Computer-assisted models using complex interaction between variables enable an accurate prediction of difficult tracheal intubation with a low proportion of patients in the inconclusive zone. An external validation of the model is now required.",0,0
26138924,Nasal obstruction and male gender contribute to the persistence of mouth opening during sleep in CPAP-treated obstructive sleep apnoea,"Background and objective: During continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, some patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) require an oronasal mask (ONM) to prevent excessive mouth leakage. Factors contributing to sleep-related mouth opening under CPAP treatment remain known. We compared mouth opening during sleep in patients treated with CPAP by nasal mask (NM) versus ONM. Methods: Cross-sectional prospective study: patients treated with CPAP for at least 4 months underwent a sleep recording using a type 4 monitoring device (Brizzy-Nomics) that records mouth opening via a magnetometric distance meter. Clinical assessment included anthropometry, smoking status and the Mallampati score. Nasal obstruction was assessed by the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation questionnaire. Results: Thirty-eight patients were included, 34 analysed (22 men; age = 57.4 (53; 62) years; body mass index = 32.6 (29.1; 35.2) kg/m(2) ; median (25th; 75th)). Twenty-seven patients were treated with NM and seven with ONM. Patients with ONM were more often active smokers and trended to have greater nasal obstruction and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s. They also exhibited a greater mouth opening during sleep (median (25th;75th) = 13.0 (11.0; 15.0) vs 6.0 (5.0; 10.0) mm, P < 0.001) and a higher oxygen desaturation index (9.5 (6.2; 15.5) vs 2.9 (1.0; 6.1) events/h, P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, male gender and nasal obstruction were independently associated with mouth opening under ONM CPAP treatment. Conclusions: After several months of CPAP treatment, some patients using ONM persist in keeping their mouths open at night. Nasal obstruction and male gender contribute to this phenomenon.",0,0
25976410,A radiographic comparison of human airway anatomy and airway manikins--Implications for manikin-based testing of artificial airways,"Objective: The aim of this prospective, single-center, observational study was to investigate the accuracy of modeling and reproduction of human anatomical dimensions in manikins by comparing radiographic upper airway measurements of 13 different models with humans. Methods: 13 commonly used airway manikins (male or female anatomy based) and 47 controls (adult humans, 37 male, 10 female) were investigated using a mediosagittal and axial cervical spine CT scan. For anatomical comparison six human upper airway target structures, the following were measured: Oblique diameter of the tongue through the center, horizontal distance between the center point of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall, horizontal distance between the vallecula and the posterior pharyngeal wall, distance of the upper oesophageal orifice length of epiglottis distance at the narrowest part of the trachea. Furthermore, the cross-section of the trachea in axial view and the cross-section of the upper oesophageal orifice in the same section was calculated. All measurements were compared gender specific, if the gender was non-specified with the whole sample. Results: None of the included 13 different airway manikins matched anatomy in human controls (n = 47) in all of the six measurements. The Laerdal Airway Management Trainer, however, replicated human airway anatomy at least satisfactorily. Conclusion: This investigation showed that all of the examined manikins did not replicate human anatomy. Manikins should therefore be selected cautiously, depending on the type of airway securing procedure. Their widespread use as a replacement for in vivo trials in the field of airway management needs to be reconsidered.",0,0
2704585,Evaluation of the flow-volume loop as an intra-operative monitor of respiratory mechanics in infants,"Airway pressure is currently the primary indicator of respiratory mechanics used by the anesthetist in the operating room. This quantity can signal that the mechanical properties of the respiratory system have changed. However, there is a need for more sophisticated monitors of mechanics, capable of indicating the nature of the change. We have investigated the use of the tidal flow-volume loop in differentiating between an obstruction of the endotracheal tube and changes in the distribution of regional ventilation, using a computer model. Endotracheal obstruction caused the descending limb of flow-volume loop to become convex to the volume axis, whereas ventilation inhomogeneity caused the curve to become concave to the volume axis. In contrast, examination of peak airway pressure did not allow differentiation between the two conditions. We conclude that, while the peak airway pressure is useful in signaling a change in a patient's condition, the combination of airway pressure and the flow-volume loop serves as a more comprehensive monitor of respiratory mechanics.",0,0

22067489,Emergency and intensive care: assessing and managing the airway,"Airway assessment and management skills are vital in an emergency department (ED) as they are the most sensitive indicator of patient deterioration. Problems as common as head injury or alcohol intoxication are associated with an inadequate airway or diminished respiratory function and can cause a patient's condition to decline rapidly. Maintaining a patient's airway and facilitating breathing is the main priority in any emergency situation, although achieving airway control can be difficult. All health professionals need to be able to safely undertake airway management. The key is a thorough assessment to determine whether the airway is patent or not. This paper will discuss the importance and practicalities of airway management and assessment in the emergency and intensive care.",0,0
24529668,Comparison of acromioaxillosuprasternal notch index (a new test) with modified Mallampati test in predicting difficult visualization of larynx,"Background: We aimed to compare the efficacy of a new bedside screening test named acromioaxillosuprasternal notch index (AASI) with modified Mallampati (MMP). Methods: A total of 603 adult patients, who were candidates for tracheal intubation in elective surgery, were enrolled in this prospective study. Preoperative airway assessment was carried out with AASI and MMP. The new AASI score is calculated based on the following measurements: (1) using a ruler, a vertical line is drawn from the top of the acromion process to the superior border of the axilla at the pectoralis major muscle (line A); (2) a second line is drawn perpendicular to line A from the suprasternal notch (line B); and (3) the portion of line A that lies above the point where line B intersects it is line C. AASI is calculated by dividing the length of line C by that of line A (AASI = C/A). After induction of anesthesia, the laryngeal view was recorded according to the Cormack-Lehane grading system. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was employed to compare between AASI and MMP. Results: Difficult visualization of larynx (DVL, Cormack-Lehane III and IV) was observed in 38 (6.3%) patients. The best cutoff point for DVL was defined at AASI > 0.49. AASI had a lower false negative rate and higher predictive values (sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy) in comparison with MMP. Conclusion: AASI was associated with higher predictive values than MMP and could be used for estimation of DVL.",1,1

We report a case of unintentional left mainstem intubation at an extremely short incisor-to-carina distance. We hypothesize that the left mainstem intubation occurred because of a distortion of the anatomy of the tracheal bifurcation, caused by the patient's severe ascites, hepatomegaly, and collapsed right lower lobe, thus creating a shallower angle of the left mainstem bronchus from midline. The short incisor-to-carina distance can be explained by ascites-induced cephalad shift of the mediastinum.",0,0
23746283,Direct laryngoscopy after potential difficult intubation in children only predicts standard Cormack and Lehane view to within one grade,"Background: Some techniques used to achieve intubation in children predicted to have a difficult airway do not involve direct laryngoscopy or assessment of the laryngeal grade. Direct laryngoscopy may therefore be performed immediately after intubation to provide a record for future anesthetics. It is unknown whether this postintubation grade accurately reflects the standard laryngeal grade in this group. Aim: The aim of the study was to identify those children who were predicted to be a difficult intubation and to perform direct laryngoscopy before and after intubation. We set out to ascertain if direct laryngoscopy performed after intubation could accurately predict the standard un-intubated laryngeal grade in this group. Methods: All children presenting for general anesthesia who were clinically predicted to be a difficult intubation were considered for this study and prospectively recruited. After induction of anesthesia, one study anesthetist performed direct laryngoscopy before and another study anesthetist then performed direct laryngoscopy after intubation. These laryngeal grades were then compared. Results: A total of 21 children were successfully recruited and studied, and all patients were successfully intubated. Overall, the postintubation grade did not reliably reflect the standard grade, but did not differ by more than one grade in any patient. In one-third of subjects, the postintubation grade was equal to the standard grade, in one-third it was a grade 'easier' and in one-third a grade 'harder'. Conclusion: Assessment and documentation of a postintubation laryngeal grade does not appear to provide reliable information for future anesthetics and may even have the potential to be misleading. Any such documentation should always refer to the presence of an endotracheal tube and be interpreted with caution.",0,0
10780771,Tumour necrosis factor-alpha production in human alveolar macrophages: modulation by inhaled corticosteroid,"Using an ex vivo alveolar macrophage model, the hypothesis that inhaled preparations of corticosteroids might have important anti-inflammatory effects on cells of the peripheral airway was tested. The tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-inducing potential of three glycolipid preparations from nonpathogenic (arabinofuranasyl lipoarabinomannan (LAM (Ara-LAM)) and virulent (mannase LAM (ManLAM)) mycobacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), in primary alveolar macrophage preparations was investigated. A novel inhaled chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-free preparation of beclomethasone dipropionate (hydrofluoroalkane 134a (HFA)-BDP) with increased peripheral lung deposition was investigated for its ability to modulate glycolipidinduced TNF-alpha production by human alveolar macrophages, in comparison with a CFC-containing preparation and placebo. Compared to the basal TNF-alpha bioactivity of 0.72 ng x mL-1 (geometric mean), the TNF-alpha bioactivity in the macrophage preparation increased following incubation with LPS (138 ng x mL-1, p<0.001), AraLAM (12.6 ng-mL-1, p<0.001) and ManLAM (1.42 ng x mL-1, p=0.02). HFA-BDP, administered in vivo, significantly reduced LPS- and ManLAM-induced TNF-alpha production by alveolar macrophages cultured ex vivo. No change in glycolipid-induced TNF-alpha production was observed following in vivo administration of CFC-BDP or HFA-placebo. This is the first demonstration of an immunomodulatory effect on alveolar cells of corticosteroid delivered via metered dose inhaler. The present findings suggest that alveolar deposition of beclomethasone dipropionate is capable of modulating the inflammatory potential of the alveolar macrophage population.",0,0
21760515,A double bending lightwand can provide more successful endotracheal intubation in patients with a short thyromental distance: a prospective randomised study,"Background and objective: This study assessed the efficacy of endotracheal intubation using a double bending lightwand in patients with an anticipated difficult airway because of a short thyromental distance. Methods: On the basis of the shape of the lightwand used, 68 patients with a thyromental distance of less than 65 mm undergoing general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the conventional bending group (n = 34), the lightwand was bent at 6.5 cm from the distal end to 90° angle. In the double bending group (n = 34), the lightwand was bent 30° at 15 cm from its tip in addition to the conventional bending. The ease of insertion was assessed by the lightwand search time and success rate at the first attempt. Post-operative complications, if any, were noted. Results: The success rate of intubation at the first attempt was higher for the double bending group (94 vs. 74%, P < 0.05). The search time was significantly shorter in the double bending group than the conventional bending group (10 ± 6 vs. 15 ± 8 s, P < 0.01). Mean blood pressure and heart rate increased after intubation in both groups (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between the groups. The incidence of post-operative sore throat and mucosal bleeding was not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: We conclude that the double bending lightwand is associated with a greater success rate of intubation in patients with an anticipated difficult airway because of a short thyromental distance.",0,0
27529028,Role of upper airway ultrasound in airway management,"Upper airway ultrasound is a valuable, non-invasive, simple, and portable point of care ultrasound (POCUS) for evaluation of airway management even in anatomy distorted by pathology or trauma. Ultrasound enables us to identify important sonoanatomy of the upper airway such as thyroid cartilage, epiglottis, cricoid cartilage, cricothyroid membrane, tracheal cartilages, and esophagus. Understanding this applied sonoanatomy facilitates clinician to use ultrasound in assessment of airway anatomy for difficult intubation, ETT and LMA placement and depth, assessment of airway size, ultrasound-guided invasive procedures such as percutaneous needle cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy, prediction of postextubation stridor and left double-lumen bronchial tube size, and detecting upper airway pathologies.

Methods: The major databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, were searched for studies published from inception to June 2014. We selected studies that used ultrasonography to confirm endotracheal tube placement. The search was limited to human studies, and had no publication date or country restrictions. Exclusion criteria included case reports, comments, reviews, guidelines and animal studies. Two reviewers extracted and verified the data independently. We summarized test performance characteristics with the use of forest plots, hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves, and bivariate random effect models. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. The methodological quality of individual studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. Results: A total of 12 eligible studies involving adult patients and cadaveric models were identified from 1488 references. For detection of esophageal intubation, the pooled sensitivity was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86-0.96) and the specificity was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98). The area under the summary ROC curve was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 26.98 (95% CI: 19.32-37.66) and 0.08 (95% CI: 0.04-0.15), respectively. Conclusions: Current evidence supports that ultrasonography has high diagnostic value for identifying esophageal intubation. With optimal sensitivity and specificity, ultrasonography can be a valuable adjunct in this aspect of airway assessment, especially in situations where capnography may be unreliable.",0,0
21057614,Assessment of airway length of Korean adults and children for otolaryngology and ophthalmic surgery using a fiberoptic bronchoscope,"Background: Knowledge regarding normal upper airway anatomy is essential for airway management and is required to prevent malpositioning of endotracheal tubes. We evaluated the length of the upper airway in Korean children and adults who had no abnormality of the upper airway using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Methods: Eighty seven patients aged 5 to 81 years undergoing noninvasive elective surgery were included in this study. After induction of anesthesia was complete, we measured the distance from the upper incisor to various components of the upper airway by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Results: In adults, the mean length between the upper incisor and midtrachea was found to be 21.8 ± 1.8 cm in males and 19.9 ± 1.3 cm in females, while the mean length of the trachea was 10.1 ± 1.3 cm in males and 10.3 ± 1.6 cm in females. The length between the upper incisor and midtrachea (IT) were correlated with height both in children (IT [cm] = 2.531 + 0.109 × height [cm]) and adults (IT [cm] = 0.167 + 0.127 × height [cm]), which shows that they differ from the western standard (length of tube [cm] = 5 + 0.1 × height [cm]). Conclusions: In adults and children, the length from the incisor to the midtrachea was significantly different when compared with western standards. Therefore, re-evaluation of the proper and precise depth of endotracheal tube in Koreans should be considered.",0,0

It is characterized by brawny induration of the submental region and floor of mouth, bearing the potential for rapid airway obstruction. Airway management, antibiotics, and judicious surgical intervention are the mainstays of successful therapy. We present a case of Ludwig's angina in a 5-year-old child and offer a meta-analysis of pediatric cases of Ludwig's angina described in the literature over the past 30 years. The presentation, etiology, management, and potential complications of this disorder in the pediatric population are discussed.",0,0
25007692,GlideScope videolaryngoscope versus flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope for awake intubation of morbidly obese patient with predicted difficult intubation,"Background: Awake fiberoptic intubation is the gold standard for management of predicted difficult intubation. The purpose of this study was to test whether Glide Scope video laryngoscopy (GVL) will provide significant advantages over fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) for awake intubation in morbidly obese patients with predicted difficult intubation. We therefore tested the hypothesis that intubation using GVL is faster than intubation with FOB. Methods: 64 morbidly obese patients with predicted difficult intubation undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive awake oral intubation by either GVL or FOB. After airway topical anesthesia and sedation using target controlled remifentanil infusion to a Ramsay sedation scale of 3, wee compared the two devices for time to intubate, successful intubation on first attempt, glottic view using Cormack and Lehane score system, response of the patient to scope, patients satisfaction and incidence of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness. Results: Intubation time was 84 +/- 37.9 seconds and 73.6 +/- 31.1 seconds for FOB and GVL respectively. 75% of patients were successfully intubated on the first attempt with FOB compared to 80.6% with GVL. Grade I/II glottic view was reported with GVL in 96.7% of patients compared to 100% with FOB. The highest target concentration of remifentanil to maintain patients sedated during intubation was 2.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml and 2.2 +/- 0.8 ng/ml in FOB and GVL respectively. No significant differences regarding maximum patient response to intubation, adverse effects or patient satisfaction were recorded between groups. Conclusion: GVL can be used as a useful alternative to FOB in morbidly obese patients with predicted difficult intubation.",0,0
9556287,Expandable metallic stents in benign tracheobronchial obstruction,"Expandable metallic stents offer advantages over previously available techniques for treating benign tracheobronchial stenosis or obstruction. Endoluminal stent placement offers a rapid and effective means of opening up narrowed airways, and results in excellent relief of symptoms and improvement in pulmonary function. Because they are delivered in a nonexpanded state using flexible over-wire systems, they can be placed using a flexible bronchoscope and can be located in second-order bronchial branches. Metallic stents have been used to treat benign airway obstruction caused by anastomotic narrowing after lung transplantation, infection, congenital lesions, tracheobronchial malacia, inflammatory conditions including relapsing polychondritis, Wegener granulomatosis, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and external compression from benign mediastinal masses or fibrosis. The stents become epithelialized, which prevents migration and permits ciliary activity to continue. Significant complications can occur, including airway inflammation, stent migration, airway erosion, and stent fracture and collapse, but more serious complications are uncommon. Computed tomography is essential in imaging patients being considered for stent placement, as it allows 1) accurate representation of airway anatomy in three dimensions. 2) measurement of airway diameter, 3) evaluation of airway anatomy distal to a narrowed segment and invisible to bronchoscopy, 4) demonstration of dynamic changes in airway morphologic features during forced exhalation in patients with airway malacia, and 5) demonstration of focal or diffuse air trapping in lung peripheral to the abnormal airway. In patients who have had stent placement, computed tomography is valuable in assessing airway morphologic features and dynamics distal to the stent, and can be valuable in assessing stent dysfunction.",0,0
19461566,Training resident anesthesiologists in adult challenging intubation comparing Truview EVO2 and Macintosh laryngoscope: a preliminary study,"Aim: Teaching airway management continues to be of high importance to the anesthesiologist, since the care of each individual patient depends on the expertise, training and knowledge of the anesthetist with different airway devices, techniques and algorithms. The aim of our study was to compare intubation performed by resident anesthesiologists in training, under senior supervision, using Truview EVO2 (Group 1) or Macintosh blade (Group 2) in a group of adult patients undergoing elective surgery. Methods: This was a pilot prospective study. Thirty patients who were scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were randomized into two groups. In Group 1, intubation was performed by using the Truview EVO2, and in Group 2 intubation was performed by using the Macintosh blade. Mallampati score, thyromental distance and neck mobility were recorded for each patient. The exclusion criteria included a Mallampati score =or<2 and a Patil distance >6 cm. The time of intubation and any occurrence of complications were recorded. Results: Intubation was always successful on the first attempt in Group 1, while it failed for 46.7% of patients in Group 2 (P=0.006). The time of intubation was not different between the two groups. No complications were recorded for Group 1 (Truview), while seven were reported in Group 2 (Macintosh) (P=0.003). Conclusions: The resident managed to intubate all patients on the first attempt with the Truview, which led to a lower incidence of complications. Despite the exiguity of the population in the study, Truview EVO2 and other videolaryngoscopes can be considered to be useful tools in training resident anesthesiologists in elective intubation.",0,0
20223572,"The influence of mouth opening on oropharyngeal leak pressure, intracuff pressure, and cuff position with the laryngeal mask airway","Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of mouth opening on oropharyngeal leak pressure, intracuff pressure, and cuff position of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Patients and methods: Fifteen patients who were scheduled for elective oral surgery were recruited into this study. A single, experienced LMA user inserted the LMA according to the manufacturer's recommended technique. Oropharyngeal leak pressure, intracuff pressure, and fiberoptic assessment of the LMA position were documented under 3 mouth conditions: neutral position (1.4-cm distance between upper and lower incisors), mouth open (5- to 6-cm distance between upper and lower incisors), and return to the neutral position. Any ventilation difficulties under the 3 mouth conditions were recorded. Results: Oropharyngeal leak pressure with the mouth open was higher than in the neutral position (P < .001). Compared with the neutral position, intracuff pressure was also higher with the mouth open (P < .001). Both measurement values returned to control levels when the neutral position was once again assumed. The LMA position observed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy was unchanged by mouth opening and was similar in the 3 mouth conditions (P = .998). Although ventilatory difficulties occurred after mouth opening in 8 of 15 patients (P < .001), it did not occur when the neutral position was reassumed. Conclusions: This study showed that mouth opening led to substantial increases in oropharyngeal leak pressure and intracuff pressure of the LMA, warranting caution because gastric insufflation, sore throat, and ventilation difficulties may occur.",0,0
22971505,"Optimal bent length of lightwand for intubation in adults: a randomized, prospective, comparative study","Objective: To evaluate the effect on intubation success of different bent lengths of a lightwand (a malleable illuminating stylet used for intubation), based on the patient's thyroid prominence-to-mandibular angle distance (TMD), thyroid prominence-to-incisor distance (TID) and gender. Methods: This prospective, randomized, blinded study included patients undergoing elective surgery. In group A, the bent length was determined based on the patient's gender. In groups B and C, the bent length was calculated according to the patient's TMD or TID, respectively. Intubation success rate, time required for intubation, haemodynamics and complications postintubation were documented. Results: A total of 246 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the study groups. There were no significant differences in number of intubation attempts and success rate among the three groups. The mean time required for intubation was significantly shorter in group A than in the other groups. There were no major complications in any group. Conclusions: Gender-determined bent length was more suitable for lightwand-guided intubation than TID or TMD. For most patients, the optimal bent length was in the range of 6.0-6.9 cm.",0,0
18214008,[Airway and respiratory management for anesthesia in the patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities],"Background: For the management of general anesthesia in the patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities, airway and respiratory disorders are severe and may cause fatal events. We retrospectively examined these risk factors. Methods: We assessed adverse airway and respiratory events associated with anesthesia from perioperative and anesthetic records of these patients retrospectively. Results: Forty-one cases (31 were for fundoplication, and 10 were for gastrostomy or jejunostomy) were involved. On anesthetic introduction, in 9 cases tracheal intubation was difficult (failed in 1 case). These and other 4 cases had developed pharyngeal and laryngeal edema. Manual ventilation by facemask was successful in all cases. During the postoperative period, pneumonia (5 cases), pleural effusion (1 case), and apnea (2 cases) occurred unexpectedly. Conclusions: Patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities belong to the group with high risk for general anesthesia.",0,0
21431052,A comparison of the upper lip bite test with hyomental/thyrosternal distances and mandible length in predicting difficulty in intubation: A prospective study,"The incidence of difficulty in tracheal intubation has been reported to range from 0.5 to 18% in patients undergoing surgery. We aimed to elucidate the role of upper lip bite test (ULBT) with other prevailing tests, hyomental/thyrosternal distances (HMD/TSD), and the mandible length (ML) and their possible correlation in predicting difficulty in intubation. After institutional approval and informed consent were obtained, 300 consecutive patients aged 20-60 years of ASA physical status I and II, scheduled for elective surgical procedures requiring tracheal intubation and meeting the inclusion criteria, were enrolled in this study. Each patient was evaluated regarding ULBT, HMD, TSD and ML. Laryngoscopy was assessed by an attending anaesthesiologist blinded to the measurements. The laryngoscopic result was graded according to Cormack and Lehane's Grading system. The negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of ULBT were found to be 94 and 100%, respectively. These corresponding figures for TSD were 88.5 and 0%, respectively. Specificities for ULBT, HMD, ML and TSD were 100, 98.9, 98.9 and 98.1%, respectively. ULBT class and laryngoscopic grading showed the greatest agreement (kappa = 0.61, P < 0.001). An agreement between laryngoscopic grading and HMD and ML also existed (0.003 and <0.001, respectively), but was comparatively weaker. The high specificity, NPV, PPV and accuracy of ULBT as revealed in this study could be a good rationale for its application in the prediction of difficulty or easiness in intubation. ML > 9 cm and HMD > 3.5 cm were good predictors of negative difficult intubation.",1,1
19636657,Management of the anticipated difficult airway--a systematic approach: continuing Professional Development,"Purpose: The purpose of this Continuing Professional Development module (CPD) is to update clinicians regarding a systematic approach for anticipated difficult airway management. Principal findings: The focus of the approach should be directed towards providing adequate oxygenation and ventilation and not necessarily intubating the trachea. The purpose of preoperative airway assessment is not only to detect possible difficult direct laryngoscopy, but also to evaluate the probability of effective ventilation using supraglottic airway devices, such as the oropharyngeal airway or the laryngeal mask airway. Predicting the degree of difficulty with direct laryngoscopy or ventilation with a supraglottic device remains an imperfect science, and the experience of the anesthesiologist plays an important role in the clinical decision-making process. When a difficult airway is anticipated, the need for tracheal intubation should be carefully assessed. If tracheal intubation is deemed non-essential, the role of a supraglottic device should be considered. If adequate management with a supraglottic device is unlikely, then intubation is indicated with the patient awake. In certain cases, a sevoflurane induction may be chosen to test the efficacy of a supraglottic device while simultaneously maintaining spontaneous ventilation. If tracheal intubation is required, a supraglottic device may be used as a bridge during induction of anesthesia and may even be used to insert the tracheal tube. The choice of either the supraglottic device or another aid to intubation depends essentially on the anesthesiologist's experience. Conclusion: Airway management should be approached systematically, always keeping in mind the importance of uninterrupted oxygenation and ventilation, especially when difficulties are anticipated. Supraglottic devices can play an important role in the management of the difficult airway, whether used for the duration of surgery or inserted as an aid to intubation.",0,0
12452244,Cuffed oropharyngeal airway in the patients undergoing short surgical procedures,"Objective: This study was designed to study the efficacy of Cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) in the patients undergoing short surgical procedures at Siriraj Hospital. Materials and method: A prospective study of 65 patients, age 15-65 years, scheduled for elective short surgical procedures under general anesthesia were managed with COPA. Lip-mandibular angle distance was used to indicate the appropriate size of COPA. Demographic characteristics, airway assessments, COPA size, insertion time, airway manipulation, complications during COPA insertion, removal and 2 hour postoperative period were recorded. Results: Success rate of COPA insertion were 93.8 per cent and 4.6 per cent at 1st attempt and 2nd attempt respectively. Insertion time was 53.27 +/- 20.07 seconds. There were 84.4 per cent of patients who needed airway manipulation during anesthesia. The incidence of complications were 12.3 per cent, 13.8 per cent and 15.4 per cent during insertion, removal and 2 hour postoperatively respectively. Conclusion: COPA is a new adjunctive airway device designed for direct connection with breathing system with a high success rate of insertion. COPA placement is an easy technique to learn but it usually requires a high incidence of airway manipulations such as head turn, jaw thrust, head tilt, and chin lift, so skill and confidence in its use requires instruction and practice. It would be unwise to use a COPA in an emergency without first having become proficient in its use for routine cases.",0,0

16738295,"Lower flange modification improves performance of the Macintosh, but not the Miller laryngoscope blade","Purpose: In order to minimize the potential for dental damage and to improve laryngeal visualization during tracheal intubation, two commonly used laryngoscope blades were modified and compared in a clinical setting: the Miller laryngoscope blade and the Macintosh laryngoscope blade. Modified versions of both laryngoscope blades with a lowered heel (Callander modification) at the proximal end of the blade were compared to standard blades. Methods: Forty patients scheduled for general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were studied prospectively. Preoperatively, the patients' airways were evaluated according to Mallampati score, thyromental distance and interincisor gap. After induction of anesthesia laryngoscopy was performed with the original laryngoscope and its modified counterpart in random order. A lateral x-ray of the neck was taken after the optimal view had been obtained, and blade-tooth distance, laryngeal view, blade-tooth contact and need for assistance were measured. Using angular calculations the laryngoscopes were analyzed at different insertion depths on graph paper, and the results were compared with data from the lateral x-rays. Results: With a modified Macintosh blade the blade-tooth distance was significantly greater in comparison to the original design (2.5 +/- 2.1 cm vs 0.2 +/- 0.1 cm, P < 0.01). Consequently the number of blade-tooth contacts was significantly lower (20% vs 75%, P < 0.05). The best laryngeal view could be obtained using a modified Macintosh laryngoscope. With a modified Miller laryngoscope laryngeal visibility was not improved and assistance was required more often to achieve adequate intubating conditions (35% vs 5%, P < 0.05). Conclusion: A reduction of the proximal flange of a Miller blade decreases the blade's effectiveness for laryngeal visualization, whereas a similar modification of a Macintosh blade increases blade-tooth distance, decreases the number of blade-tooth contacts and provides a better laryngeal view.",0,0
7840405,[Difficult intubation due to facial malformations in a child. The laryngeal mask as an aid],"Variations in anatomy of the bony and soft-tissue structures of the neck and facial cranium due to trauma, disease, or dysmorphic syndromes may lead to severe intubation problems. These patients are admitted for mandibulofacial and otolaryngologic surgery. It is important to inspect the patient's outer and inner pharyngeal structures carefully during preoperative assessment, as suggested by Mallampati. The observer estimates the facility of intubation by inspection of the faucial pillars, soft palate, and uvula. Unfortunately, even careful examination does not predict every case of difficult intubation, so that unexpected problems may occur. There may also be difficulties in ventilating these patients with a face mask. Safe intubation is possible in these cases using the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), laryngoscopy with a rigid optical aid, and the fibreoptic bronchoscope. Case report. We report a 14-month-old girl with Goldenhar's syndrome (oculo-auricular dysplasia) who presented for soft-palate surgery. This syndrome belongs to the group of cranio-mandibular-facial malformations; the main symptoms are congenital unilateral malformations in the area of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches. The patient's jaw was hypoplastic with aplasia of the temporo-mandibular joint, which led to asymmetry of the lower face and an extremely short mandible. Additionally, we observed a large tongue in relation to the small jaw. Macrostomia is part of the syndrome, and may lead to underestimation of intubation problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
8533873,[The laryngeal mask airway in the difficult intubation. The results of a prospective study],"Objective: The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was prospectively used in patients who were difficult to intubate to evaluate whether it improves ventilation compared to a face mask, facilitates fibreoptic intubation, and how often blind intubation would be possible. Methods: In a university hospital, 30 patients who were difficult to intubate (35 operative procedures) and 50 normal subjects were investigated; 23 patients had had radical resection of a facial tumor with irradiation at a previous time and 7 could not be intubated conventionally (grade 3 and 4 visibility of the larynx according to Cormack [14]). Blind intubation was attempted with a bent bougie, a 6.0-mm uncuffed tube, or a straight bougie. Results: Insertion of the LMA was possible in all except 1 patient with a mouth opening of 1 cm. Ventilation via the LMA was always excellent and, for tumor patients, superior to a face mask. In tumor patients, leak pressure was higher than in patients with normal cervical anatomy either with or without difficult intubation conditions (25.2 +/- 7.9, P < 0.05, vs. 20.8 +/- 4.4 vs. 20.6 +/- 4.9 cmH2O; n.s.; Fig. 2). Fibreoptic intubation through the LMA was successful in all cases and easier than via a nasal or oral route. Blind intubation was successful in 22% of difficult to intubate patients and 19% of normals, mainly using a 6.0 mm uncuffed endotracheal tube. Substitution of an uncuffed oral tube inserted via the LMA by a nasal endotrachel tube using a reinforced stomach tube is described (Fig. 4). Conclusion: The LMA improves ventilation, facilitates fibreoptic intubation, and offers the possibility for blind endotracheal intubation in difficult to intubate patients. Blind intubation though the LMA has to be practised extensively to have a high success rate. The LMA represents an additional aid for the anaesthetic management of patients who are difficult to intubate.",0,0
27366457,Sensitivity of the Combination of Mallampati Scores with Anthropometric Measurements and the Presence of Malignancy to Predict Difficult Intubation,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the combinations of the Mallampati test and anthropometric measurements with the highest selectivity value. In addition, we aim to identify a possible correlation between head circumference measurement, the presence of malignancy and difficult intubation. Methods: Patients who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anaesthesia, who fell into Group 1-2 according to ASA criteria and were between the ages of 18-70 years were included in the study. Patients with Cormack-Lehane scores of 3-4 were considered to be difficult intubations. Thyromental distance, sternomental distance, mandibular distance, neck length, neck circumference and head circumference were measured during the anthropometric measurements. Results: According to the ROC analysis, there was a significant difference in the thyromental distance, sternomental distance, neck length, neck circumference and head circumference between the easy and difficult intubation groups (p<0.05). The incidence of difficult intubation was 8.3% in patients with non-head-neck malignancies, whereas the incidence was 7.1% in patients without any malignancies. The difference between these groups was not statistically significant (χ(2)=0.101; p=0.751). Conclusion: To predict the incidence of difficult intubation, the test with the highest selectivity and highest positive predictive values was the combination of Mallampati-thyromental distance. We believe that the head circumference and neck length measurement, in addition to the current anthropometric measurements, may be crucial to predict the incidence of difficult intubations. In addition, we believe that the anticipation of difficult intubations in patients with non-head-neck malignancies is not different from the normal population.",0,0
25456513,Prevention of airway fires: testing the safety of endotracheal tubes and surgical devices in a mechanical model,"Objectives: This study was designed to assess the ability of carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers and radiofrequency ablation devices (Coblator) (ArthoCare Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) to ignite either a non-reinforced (polyvinylchloride) endotracheal tube (ETT) or an aluminum and fluoroplastic wrapped silicon (""laser safe"") ETT at varying titrations of oxygen in a mechanical model of airway surgery. Methods: Non-reinforced and laser safe ETTs were suspended in a mechanical model imitating endoscopic airway surgery. A CO2 laser set at 5-30 watts was fired at the ETT at oxygen concentrations ranging from 21% to 88%. The process was repeated using a radiofrequency ablation (RFA) device. All trials were repeated to ensure accuracy. Results: The CO2 laser ignited a fire when contacting a non-reinforced ETT in under 2 seconds at oxygen concentrations as low as 44%. The CO2 laser could not ignite a laser safe ETT under any conditions, unless it struck the non-reinforced distal tip of the ETT. With the RFA, a fire could not be ignited with either reinforced or non-reinforced ETTs. Conclusions: RFA presents no risk of ignition in simulated airway surgery. CO2 lasers should be utilized with a reinforced ETT or no ETT, as fires can easily ignite when lasers strike a non-reinforced ETT. Decreasing the fraction of inspired oxygen reduces the risk of fire.",0,0

24183034,[Comparison of Cookgas and Fastrach intubating laryngeal mask airway with fiberoptic bronchoscope in anticipated difficult airway management],"Objective: To compare the clinical effectiveness of fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB)-guided intubation through the Cookgas intubating laryngeal airway(CILA)and the Fastrach intubating laryngeal mask airway (FT-LMA) in the management of anticipated difficult airways. Methods: Sixty patients with all three difficult intubation criterion (thyromental distance<60 mm, interincisor distance<35 mm, and Mallampati class 3 or 4) undergoing elective plastic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into CILA group (n=30) and FT-LMA group (n=30). After anesthesia being induced and CILA or FT-LMA being inserted, the patients were treated with FOB-guided intubation through CILA or FT-LMA. The success of the intubating laryngeal airway(ILA)insertion and FOB-guided intubation, the number of attempts, and the duration of the successful attempt were recorded. Results: The ILA was inserted successfully in 30 patients from CILA group and 27 patients from FT-LMA group. Three failed cases in FT-LMA group were inserted successfully with CILA. In CILA group, the first FOB-guided intubation attempt succeeded in 26 patients, and 4 cases were intubated at the second attempt. In 27 patients of FT-LMA group, 20 cases were intubated successfully at the first attempt, 4 cases at the second attempt, and 3 cases failed; of these three failed patients, two patients were intubated smoothly with FOB through CILA at the first attempt, one was intubated by FOB via CILA at the second attempt. The duration of FT-LMA insertion [(35.3±12.8)s] was significantly longer when compared with CILA [(23.9±17.5)s] (P<0.05). However, the duration of FOB-guided intubation through CILA and FT-LMA [(48.6±13.5)s vs.(53.2±14.2)s] and the time of ILA removal [(40.4±10.2)s vs. (38.5±11.3)s] were not significantly different between these two groups (P>0.05). The adverse events during and after intubtion were not significantly different between these two groups. Conclusions: FOB-guided intubation through CILA and FT-LMA is safe and feasible for the management of anticipated difficult airways. However, in patients with severe scar contracture of face and neck and those with huge expander in neck, the CILA insertion and FOB-guided intubation via CILA is superior to FT-LMA.",0,0
24193230,Difficult mask ventilation in obese patients: analysis of predictive factors,"Background: This study aimed to determine the accuracy of commonly used preoperative difficult airway indices as predictors of difficult mask ventilation (DMV) in obese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2). Methods: In 309 consecutive obese patients undergoing general surgery, the modified Mallampati test, patient's Height/Thyromental distance ratio, Inter-Incisor Distance, Protruding Mandible (PM), history of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Neck Circumference (NC) were recorded preoperatively. DMV was defined as Grade 3 mask ventilation (MV) by the Han's scale (MV inadequate, unstable or requiring two practitioners). Data are shown as means±SD or number and proportions. Independent DMV predictors were identified by multivariate analysis. The discriminating capacity of the model (ROC curve area) and adjusted weights for the risk factors (odds ratios) were also determined. Results: BMI averaged 42.5±8.3 kg/m2. DMV was reported in 27 out of 309 patients (8.8%; 95%CI 5.6-11.9%). The multivariate analysis retained NC (OR 1.17; P<0.0001), limited PM (1.99; P=0.046) and Mallampati test (OR 2.12; P=0.009) as risk predictors for DMV. Male gender was also included in the final model (OR 1.87; P=0.06) as biologically important variable albeit the borderline statistical significance. The model yielded a good discriminating capacity (ROC curve 0.85). The four parameters were used to create an unweighted prediction score (ROC curve 0.84) with >2 associated factors as the best discriminating point for DMV. Conclusion: Obese patients show increased incidence of DMV with respect to the undifferentiated surgical population. Limited PM, Mallampati test and NC are important DMV predictors.",0,0
8908216,Prediction of difficult intubation,"The incidence of a difficult laryngoscopy or intubation varies from 1.5% to 13%, and failed intubation has been identified as one of the anaesthesia-related causes of death or permanent brain damage. Problems in the airway management can be predicted based on previous anaesthesia records, the medical history of the patient and a physical examination. Several radiological measurements have been reported to be associated with a difficult intubation. The sensitivities of the commonly used bedside tests i.e. the Mallampati classification and the thyromental distance have been reported to be from 42% to 81%, and from 62% to 91%, respectively. The figures for the specificity have varied from 66% to 84% and from 25% to 82%, respectively. The other subjective assessments and objective measurements employed for the prediction of a difficult intubation reach comparable sensitivities and specificities.

12092321,Standard ENT clinical evaluation of the sleep-disordered breathing patient; a consensus report,"Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) patients usually undergo an ENT clinical examination before any therapeutic decision. This clinical examination would be predictive about the occurrence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome, cost effective, reproducible and would determine the sites of obstruction in the upper airways. To achieve this, ENT specialists from Belgium, representatives of academic hospitals in the country, have tried to establish an updated work-up in the clinical evaluation of the SDB patients. History, risk factors evaluation, excessive daytime sleepiness, static and dynamic evaluation of the upper airways (velopharynx aspect, tonsils grading, Mallampati score, Müller's maneuver, fiberoptic evaluation) have been standardized in a consensus report easily accessible to the vast majority of ENT specialists. This consensus must be understood as a clinical work-up to perform before the monitoring of breathing during sleep.",0,0
21883122,"Insertion of six different supraglottic airway devices whilst wearing chemical, biological, radiation, nuclear-personal protective equipment: a manikin study","Six different supraglottic airway devices: Combitube™, laryngeal mask airway, intubating laryngeal mask airway (Fastrach™), i-gel™, Laryngeal Tube™ and Pro-Seal™ laryngeal mask airway were assessed by 58 paramedic students for speed and ease of insertion in a manikin, whilst wearing either chemical, biological, radiation, nuclear-personal protective equipment (CBRN-PPE) or a standard uniform. All devices took significantly longer to insert when wearing CBRN-PPE compared with standard uniform (p < 0.001). In standard uniform, insertion time was shorter than 45 s in 90% of attempts for all devices except the Combitube, for which 90% of attempts were completed by 53 s. Whilst wearing CBRN-PPE the i-gel was the fastest device to insert with a mean (SD (95% CI)) insertion time of 19 (8 (17-21))s, p < 0.001, with the Combitube the slowest with mean (65 (23 (59-71))s. Wearing of CBRN-PPE has a negative impact on supraglottic airway insertion time.",0,0
25400507,GlideScope Use improves intubation success rates: an observational study using propensity score matching,"Background: Rigid video laryngoscopes are popular alternatives to direct laryngoscopy for intubation, but further large scale prospective studies comparing these devices to direct laryngoscopy in routine anesthesiology practice are needed. We hypothesized that the first pass success rate with one particular video laryngoscope, the GlideScope, would be higher than the success rate with direct laryngoscopy. Methods: 3831 total intubation attempts were tracked in an observational study comparing first-pass success rate using a Macintosh or Miller-style laryngoscope with the GlideScope. Propensity scoring was then used to select 626 subjects matched between the two groups based on their morphologic traits. Results: Comparing the GlideScope and direct laryngoscopy groups suggested that intubation would be more difficult in the GlideScope group based on the Mallampati class, cervical range of motion, mouth opening, dentition, weight, and past intubation history. Thus, a propensity score based on these factors was used to balance the groups into two 313 patient cohorts. Direct laryngoscopy was successful in 80.8% on the first-pass intubation attempt, while the GlideScope was successful in 93.6% (p <0.001; risk difference of 0.128 with a 95% CI of 0.0771 - 0.181). Conclusion: A greater first-attempt success rate was found when using the GlideScope versus direct laryngoscopy. In addition, the GlideScope was found to be 99% successful for intubation after initial failure of direct laryngoscopy, helping to reduce the incidence of failed intubation.",0,0

9728849,The laryngeal mask airway reliably provides rescue ventilation in cases of unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation along with difficult mask ventilation,"In 1995, our department of anesthesiology established an airway team to assist in treating unanticipated difficult endotracheal intubations and an airway quality improvement (QI) form to document the use of emergency airway techniques in airway crises (laryngeal mask airway [LMA], flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, retrograde intubation [RI], transtracheal jet ventilation [TTJV], and cricothyrotomy). Over a 2-yr period, team members and staff anesthesiologists completed airway QI forms to document the smallest peripheral SpO2 during an airway crisis, the number of direct laryngoscopies (DL) performed before using an emergency airway technique, and the emergency airway technique that succeeded in rescue ventilation. Team members agreed to use the LMA as the first emergency airway technique to treat the difficult ventilation/difficult intubation scenario. A SpO2 value < or =90% during mask ventilation defined difficult ventilation. Inability to perform tracheal intubation by DL defined difficult intubation. An increase in the SpO2 value >90% defined rescue ventilation. Review of airway QI forms from October 1, 1995 until October 1, 1997 revealed 25 cases of difficult ventilation/difficult intubation. Before airway rescue, the median SpO2 was 80% (range 50%-90%), and there were four median attempts at DL (range one to nine). The LMA had a success rate of 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77-100). Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, TTJV, RI, and surgical cricothyrotomy had success rates of 50% (95% CI 0-100), 33% (95% CI 0-100), 100% (95% CI 37-100), and 100% (95% CI 37-100), respectively. LMA insertion as the first alternative airway technique was useful in dealing with unanticipated instances of simultaneous difficulty with mask ventilation and tracheal intubation. Implications: Twenty-five cases of simultaneous difficulty with mask ventilation and tracheal intubation occurred after the induction of general anesthesia during the study period. The laryngeal mask was used in 17 cases, and it provided rescue ventilation without complication in 94% of these cases (95% confidence interval 77-100).",0,0
18828097,The body constitution of patients and intubation scales as predictors of difficult intubation considered in relation to the experience of the intubator,"The aims of the study were to identify factors that may result in difficulties in intubation, and to compare the results obtained when an experienced and when a less experienced anaesthesiologist was involved. The 96 patients included in the study were evaluated for difficult intubation according to the following scales: Mallampati, upper lip bite test (ULBT) and Patil. The mobility of the cervical segments of the vertebral column, the distance between the jugular notch of the sternum and the chin and the anatomical constitution of the body were other factors that were taken into consideration. Statistical analysis was performed in order to identify factors that may result in difficulties in intubation for an experienced and for a less experienced anaesthesiologist.",0,0
6697743,Nosocomial lung infection and its diagnosis,"Nosocomial pneumonia occurs in 0.5% to 5.0% of all hospital admissions and is responsible for 15% of hospital deaths. Up to 60% of ICU patients may develop pneumonia, depending on the severity of their underlying disease. Despite the availability of potent antibiotics, ICU patients who develop Gram-negative pneumonia have a disturbingly high mortality rate. Specific etiologic diagnosis is frequently lacking because microbiological samples are commonly contaminated by oropharyngeal secretions which are colonized by Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in up to 100% of ICU patients. Great controversy surrounds the value of various methods used to diagnose nosocomial pneumonia. Clinical criteria of pneumonia include fever, leukocytosis, purulent tracheobronchial secretions, and a new infiltrate on chest x-ray--all of which are also frequently observed in patients free of pneumonia. Tracheobronchial secretions are often contaminated by microorganisms colonizing the upper airways and their examination may provide misleading information and result in patient mismanagement. Blood cultures are valuable but positive in only a small proportion of patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Transtracheal and transthoracic aspiration are unsatisfactory in the intubated patient requiring mechanical ventilation. Immunologic techniques like countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis are promising but presently inadequate to screen for a wide variety of organisms. Transbronchial or open-lung biopsy may be considered if the pneumonia is thought to be due to opportunistic organisms rather than bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
9649994,Value of oropharyngeal Mallampati classification in predicting difficult laryngoscopy among obese patients,"The prediction of difficult intubation in obese patients was investigated by co-estimating the degree of visibility of oropharyngeal structures in conjunction with the respective body mass index. Data were collected prospectively in a series of 1833 consecutive adult patients. Body mass index (BMI) in kg m-2 was used as a measure of obesity (morbid: > 40, moderate: 30-40, no obesity: < 30). The oropharyngeal class findings were assessed using the original methodology as well as by a modification requiring the tongue to be pulled forward by the examiner. Difficult intubation was defined as inadequate exposure of the glottis by direct laryngoscopy. Both oropharyngeal class methodologies were of equal sensitivity, whereas the modified technique presented a significantly higher positive predictive value (50.0% vs. 37.2%, P < 0.01). Statistical analysis revealed an increased risk of difficult laryngoscopy among obese patients compared with subjects with normal body mass index (20.2% vs. 7.6%, P < 0.001). When obesity is estimated with respect to oropharyngeal class the positive predictive value is greatly improved (66.7% vs. 20.2%, P < 0.001). We conclude that obesity which is associated with a disproportionately large base of the tongue, is a predisposing factor for difficult laryngoscopy.",0,0
24700895,Suction catheter guided insertion of ProSeal laryngeal mask airway: Experience by untrained physicians,"Background: The use of suction catheter (SC) has been shown to improve success rate during ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) insertion in expert users. Aims: The aim of this study was to compare insertion of PLMA performed by untrained physicians using a SC or the digital technique (DT) in anaesthetised non-paralysed patients. Methods: In this prospective randomised double-blind study, conducted in the operating setting, 254 patients (American Society of Anaesthesiologists I-II, aged 18-65 years), undergoing minor surgery were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were body mass index >35 kg/m(2), laryngeal or oesophageal varices, risk of aspiration or difficult face mask ventilation either referred or suspected (Langeron's criteria ≥2) and modified Mallampati classification score >2. Participants were randomly allocated to one of the two groups in which PLMA was inserted using DT (DT-group) or SC (SC-group). Statistical analysis: Chi-square test with Yates' correction, Mann-Whitney U-test or Student's t-test were carried-out as appropriate. Results: The final insertion success rate was greater in SC-groupcompared with DT-group 90.1% (n = 109) versus 74.4% (n = 99) respectively (P = 0.002). Mean airway leak pressure was higher in SC-group compared to DT-group (23.7 ± 3.9 vs. 21.4 ± 3.2 respectively; (P = 0.001). There were no differences in insertion time, post-operative airway morbidity and complications. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that SC-technique improves the success rate of PLMA insertion by untrained physicians.",0,0
20420138,[Case of pseudoankylosis of the mandible after craniotomy],"Craniotomy sometimes causes pseudoankylosis of the mandible, i.e., limited mouth opening, leading to a difficult airway. We describe a case of difficult airway due to pseudoankylosis of the mandible after craniotomy, in which orotracheal intubation was successfully performed with an AirWay Scope (AWS). A 60-year-old woman was scheduled for clipping of an unruptured cerebral aneurysm. She had undergone emergency clipping of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm under frontotemporal craniotomy on the other side three weeks previously. In the previous anesthesia, she had presented normal mouth opening, and orotracheal intubation had been easily performed. Preoperative examination for the second surgery, however, revealed that she had a limited mouth opening with 1.8 cm of interincisor distance, resulting in a class 4 Mallampati view. A difficult airway was anticipated. In order to avoid the risk of hypertension caused by sedated-awake fiberoptic intubation, we planned orotracheal intubation under general anesthesia with AWS. After careful induction with fentanyl and propofol, the blade was inserted smoothly. Her glottic opening was easily visualized, and her trachea was intubated without any difficulty or any distinct hemodynamic disturbance. Careful assessment of the interincisor distance is essential in patients who have previously undergone craniotomy.",0,0
5501005,The role of hypothalamic temperature in the control of panting in the chicken exposed to heat,"1. In unanaesthetized chickens, the temperatures of the hypothalamus, colon and skin have been recorded in relation to the onset and cessation of thermally induced panting.2. During control conditions, hypothalamic temperature showed fluctuations associated with arousal and movement. It was lower than colonic temperature by about 0.9 degrees C but this difference generally decreased during exposure to heat.3. When the birds were exposed abruptly to 40 degrees C, or to ambient temperatures increasing gradually from 20 to 52 degrees C, there was a delay of 15-65 min and marked increases in both peripheral and central body temperatures before panting commenced.4. Infra-red irradiation of the thorax and abdomen caused vasodilatation in the comb and toe before detectable increases in the deep body temperatures. Increasing the colonic temperature by up to 2 degrees C did not cause panting until hypothalamic temperature was also raised. This inhibitory effect of normal hypothalamic temperature was enhanced by low ambient temperature.5. Infra-red irradiation of the head increased hypothalamic temperature by up to 3.5 degrees C and caused vasodilatation in the toe without changes in colonic temperature. Panting, however, did not occur so long as colonic temperature was within the normal range. The inhibitory effect of normal colonic temperature was again enhanced by low ambient temperature.6. In anaesthetized chickens, selective heating of the head and body caused panting only after increases in both the hypothalamic and colonic temperatures.7. Repeated exposure of birds to 40 degrees C did not reduce the time delay before panting started.8. It is concluded that panting in the fowl requires an increase in some extracranial deep body temperature as well as in that of the hypothalamus.",0,0
25280140,Randomized controlled pilot trial of the rigid and flexing laryngoscope versus the fiberoptic bronchoscope for intubation of potentially difficult airway,"Background: The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) is viewed as the gold standard device for awake intubation in the difficult airway. The newer rigid flexible laryngoscope (RIFL) was developed for similar indications. In this study we compare these two devices for management of potentially difficult airways after induction of general anesthesia. Methods: Adult surgical patients requiring endotracheal intubation and having a predicted difficult airway based on airway examination, BMI≥35, and/or history of prior difficult intubation were randomized to undergo endotracheal intubation with either the RIFL or FOB. Induction was performed in usual manner, and intubation was performed by providers proficient with both airway devices after induction of general anesthesia. The primary outcomes measured were intubation success, time to intubation, number of attempts, and the need for airway assist maneuvers. The lowest observed oxygen saturation and airway trauma were also recorded. Results: A total of 41 patients were enrolled, with 20 randomized to each group and 1 withdrawal. Intubation was successful in all patients with both devices. The median time for successful intubation was significantly shorter in the RIFL group compared to the FOB group (49 vs. 64 seconds; P=0.048). Airway assist maneuvers were required in 2 (10%) intubations with the RIFL compared to 16 (80%) intubations with the FOB (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in lowest oxygen saturation or airway trauma. Conclusion: The RIFL required significantly less time and fewer airway assist maneuvers for successful endotracheal intubation compared to FOB when used by experienced providers in patients with anticipated difficult airways.",0,0
9367469,Airway deposition and clearance and systemic pharmacokinetics of amiloride following aerosolization with an ultrasonic nebulizer to normal airways,"Study objectives: Airway epithelial ion transport is an important component of the airway defense mechanism, and new therapies that target ion transport are being developed. Amiloride is an example of such a new drug, exerting a dose-dependent action to inhibit Na+ transport. Amiloride may be useful in cystic fibrosis, blocking the characteristic airway epithelial Na+ hyperabsorption that occurs in the disease. To evaluate airway and systemic delivery of amiloride via an ultrasonic nebulizer (Omron NE-UO7), we measured the airway surface concentrations of amiloride in normal volunteers via a novel approach, together with the systemic pharmacokinetics of amiloride. Design: Direct measurement of airway surface liquid, plasma, and urine amiloride concentrations following ultrasonic nebulization. Participants/interventions: Seven normal subjects were studied in the General Clinical Research Center of the University of North Carolina. Following inhalation with amiloride (1 mg/mL, 4.5 mL) for approximately 12 min, a bronchoscopy was performed. Amiloride deposition and clearance from airway surfaces over 1 h were evaluated by transbronchoscopic sampling using preweighed filter papers. Pulmonary and systemic absorption was assessed by measuring drug concentrations in blood and urine. Results: The mean volume aerosolized was 3.5+/-0.3 mL during 12 min of aerosolization time; the mean initial concentration of amiloride on airway surfaces after nebulization was 1.6 x 10(-4) mol/L, with an elimination half life of approximately 23 min. Peak plasma concentrations of amiloride (30 min, 3.36+/-0.70 ng/mL) suggest early absorption across lung surfaces, rather than via the GI route. Mean urinary excretion of amiloride over 72 h was 0.63+/-0.07 mg, with 87% excreted in the first 24 h. Conclusions: The ultrasonic nebulizer rapidly delivers amiloride to normal conducting airways as assessed by the transbronchoscopic sampling technique. Early blood concentrations of amiloride probably reflect initial absorption across lung surfaces and are a useful index of the efficiency of the machine.",0,0
25435415,"[Predictive value of preoperative tests in estimating difficult intubation in patients who underwent direct laryngoscopy in ear, nose, and throat surgery]","Background and objectives: Predictive value of preoperative tests in estimating difficult intubation may differ in the laryngeal pathologies. Patients who had undergone direct laryngoscopy (DL) were reviewed, and predictive value of preoperative tests in estimating difficult intubation was investigated. Methods: Preoperative, and intraoperative anesthesia record forms, and computerized system of the hospital were screened. Results: A total of 2611 patients were assessed. In 7.4% of the patients, difficult intubations were detected. Difficult intubations were encountered in some of the patients with Mallampati scoring (MS) system Class 4 (50%), Cormack-Lehane classification (CLS) Grade 4 (95.7%), previous knowledge of difficult airway (86.2%), restricted neck movements (cervical ROM) (75.8%), short thyromental distance (TMD) (81.6%), vocal cord mass (49.5%) as indicated in parentheses (p<0.0001). MS had a low sensitivity, while restricted cervical ROM, presence of a vocal cord mass, short thyromental distance, and MS each had a relatively higher positive predictive value. Incidence of difficult intubations increased 6.159 and 1.736-fold with each level of increase in CLS grade and MS class, respectively. When all tests were considered in combination difficult intubation could be classified accurately in 96.3% of the cases. Conclusion: Test results predicting difficult intubations in cases with DL had observedly overlapped with the results provided in the literature for the patient populations in general. Differences in some test results when compared with those of the general population might stem from the concomitant underlying laryngeal pathological conditions in patient populations with difficult intubation.",0,0
26402578,Assessment of Vibratory Characteristics in Children Following Airway Reconstruction Using Flexible and Rigid Endoscopy and Stroboscopy,"Importance: Up to half of children have substantial dysphonia after airway reconstruction. Visual assessment of vocal function is valuable. Feasibility of flexible and rigid endoscopy has been reported; however, the clinical utility of stroboscopy has not been examined. Rating of vibratory characteristics, such as mucosal wave and amplitude of vibration, is essential for the development of interventions to improve voice outcomes. Objective: To examine (1) clinicians’ ratings of anatomical and physiological features in children following airway reconstruction on initial voice evaluation using videolaryngostroboscopy and (2) the relationship of age to the type of endoscopy used. Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective medical record review of 32 patients aged 3 to 21 years evaluated for post–airway reconstruction dysphonia between July 2011 and July 2012 at a quaternary care children’s hospital. Interventions: Clinical voice evaluation protocol including rigid and/or flexible endoscopy with stroboscopy. Main outcomes and measures: Demographic and voice quality characteristics were collected. The ability to complete endoscopy and ratings of anatomical and/or physiological features were assessed by a consensus of 4 clinicians. A t test was used to determine whether age was a significant factor in successful completion of videolaryngostroboscopy. Results: Of 31 children who underwent flexible videolaryngostroboscopy, 22 (71%) examinations were completed with a distal chip endoscope and 9 (29%) with a fiberoptic. Significant differences were found in age between children who completed the distal chip vs. fiberoptic examination (mean [SD], 7.3 [2.7] vs. 5.5 [6.2] years; P = .05). Rigid endoscopy was attempted for 14 (44%) of 32 patients; 9 examinations (64%) were successful. Significant differences were found in age between patients for whom a rigid endoscopy could be successfully completed vs. those for whom it was not (mean [SD], 12.9 [3.4] vs. 6.2 [2.1] years; P < .001). Eighteen (56%) were glottic phonators, 8 (25%) supraglottic, and 6 (19%) aphonic. Vibratory characteristics were visible in 10 of 37 examinations (27%); 6 (16%) had ratable characteristics. Conclusions and relevance: Endoscopy can be successfully completed in most children who have undergone airway reconstruction, most often using a distal chip endoscope.We found that vibratory characteristics were often not assessed adequately using videolaryngostroboscopy. Further work identifying imaging modalities that better display vibratory characteristics, such as high-speed videoendoscopy, may provide new insight into vocal function and lead to a more thorough evaluation.",0,0

21146059,Anesthetic management of a patient with Cri Du Chat syndrome. Case report,"Background and objectives: Cri Du Chat syndrome is a chromosomal disorder with peculiar clinical characteristics including airways abnormalities that require special care by anesthesiologists when handling those patients. Objective: To present a case of outpatient anesthesia in a patient with Cri Du Chat syndrome and discuss the anesthetic aspects related to this disorder. Case report: Male patient, 14 years old, 25 kg, with Cri Du Chat syndrome, physical status ASA P2, was admitted for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and esophageal dilation. The patient had mental retardation, a few episodes of seizures, and marked hypertonia of the limbs. Airways exam showed limited cervical mobility and thyromental distance less than six centimeters. The patient was unable to comprehend verbal commands, making it difficult to undertake a complete assessment of the airways. Other findings on physical exam included microcephaly, micrognathism, subtle strabismus, limb hypertonia with flexion, and protrusion of the tip of the tongue. Intravenous fentanyl 50 μg, midazolam 1 mg, and propofol 60 mg were administered. The patient was maintained on spontaneous ventilation. The procedure lasted 5 minutes, without intercurrences. Conclusions: Patients with Cri Du Chat syndrome have clinical characteristics that are very important for their anesthetic management, being the responsibility of the anesthesiologist to consider carefully the structural particularities of each patient.",0,0
8024137,Head extension and laryngeal view during laryngoscopy with cervical spine stabilization maneuvers,"Background: Direct laryngoscopy frequently is modified in patients with known or suspected cervical spine injury. The goals of this study were to measure the degrees of head extension required to expose the arytenoid cartilages and glottis if neck flexion were not possible and to determine whether in-line stabilization maneuvers alter the amount of head extension. Methods: The subjects were anesthesized patients with normal cervical spines and Mallampati class 1 oropharyngeal views. Head extension was measured relative to a line drawn perpendicular to the table. Stabilization consisted of either passive immobilization, with the head held flat against a rigid board, or axial traction. Results: Without stabilization, arytenoid cartilage exposure and the best view of the glottis was achieved with a 10 +/- 5 degree (mean +/- SD) head extension and a 15 +/- 6 degree head extension, respectively (n = 31). Head immobilization reduced extension angles 4 +/- 5 degrees for arytenoid exposure and 5 +/- 6 degrees for best view compared with no stabilization. Conclusions: Head immobilization reduced head extension necessary for laryngoscopy. If head extension is construed to be potentially dangerous in patients with cervical spine injuries, head immobilization without traction might be the preferable stabilization technique.",0,0
12867862,Correction of upper airway obstruction in the newborn with internal mandibular distraction osteogenesis,"Tracheostomy for management of neonatal airway obstruction may be life saving but is associated with complications and developmental problems. As an alternative, the effectiveness of internal mandibular distraction osteogenesis was investigated in select neonatal patients with micrognathia and upper airway obstruction. Preoperative tests (sleep study, direct laryngobronchoscopy, and ""milk scan"" for GI reflux) were used to select appropriate candidates for the procedure. Excluded were patients with 1) central apnea, 2) severe reflux, 3) other airway lesions, and 4) mild to moderate obstruction controlled by positioning. Of 44 newborns (aged <3 weeks) with upper airway obstruction and micrognathia seen in the neonatal intensive care unit, 19 underwent tracheostomy, 10 were discharged with home monitoring and positional instructions, and 15 underwent bilateral mandibular lengthening with microdistractors. Of those who underwent mandibular distraction, a tracheostomy was avoided in 14 of 15 patients. Relative improvement in the posterior airway space was seen on 3D CT scans, cephalograms, and laryngobronchoscopies obtained preoperatively, postoperatively, and during follow-up evaluation. One of these 15 patients required a tracheostomy for postoperative central apnea. In an average of just 4.5 days following completion of distraction, patients were discharged home with improved oral feeding and no feeding tube. This study suggests that for selected newborns, the use of internal microdistractors allows for avoidance of a tracheostomy and improved oral feeding.",0,0
9187787,Difficult intubation and brain-stem anaesthesia,"Purpose: To present a case of difficult intubation with brainstem anaesthesia after retrobulbar block with bupivacaine and lidocaine and sedation with midazolam and to point out that close monitoring and timely treatment is important in preventing an unfavourable outcome. Clinical features: An 82-yr-old man with treated hypertension and stable angina was scheduled for cataract extraction. Physical examination revealed a class 2 airway. He had a retrobulbar block after topical tetracaine drops, with bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% with hyaluronidase under sedation with 1 mg midazolam. Five minutes after the block, respiration slowed, he became unresponsive and oxygen saturation decreased to 80%. Immediate ventilation with mask without additional oxygen improved saturation. Attempted tracheal intubation failed: the epiglottis could not be visualized despite flaccid jaw and extremities. A laryngeal mask airway was placed which was leaking and adequate ventilation could not be achieved but a second laryngeal mask airway was placed successfully. Conclusion: This case emphasizes the need for dose monitoring and personnel capable of managing the difficult airway when intra-orbital anaesthesia is used.",0,0

22201182,New method for quantitative assessment of airway calibre using a stereovision fibreoptic bronchoscope,"Background: We have developed a new bronchoscopy system with two independent lenses at the tip of the device. This enables measurement of object size using the principle of triangulation. This study was performed to assess the accuracy of this system. Methods: The accuracy of the bronchoscopy system was confirmed by measuring the diameters of four plastic tubes and 36 airway calibres in 12 surgical patients under general anaesthesia. The measured diameters of the tubes and airway tracts were compared with the manufactured diameters of tubes and those measured by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)-based virtual bronchoscopy, respectively. Results: Using the new bronchoscope system, tube diameters, 9, 12, 15, and 19 mm, were measured as 9.9 (0.7), 12.8 (1.4), 16.3 (1.6), and 20.1 (2.0) mm, respectively. Airway calibres obtained by a stereovision bronchoscopy and HRCT-based virtual bronchoscopy were 8.66 (4.31) and 9.38 (5.09) mm, respectively. There is a significant correlation between airway calibres with the two measurement methods (r=0.975, P<0.01). Conclusions: We have confirmed that this new bronchoscopy system could provide relatively accurate quantitative data. This new system may be useful in the clinic to measure airway dimension and lesion sizes such as tumours.",0,0
18401987,[General anesthesia in mentally disabled patients undergoing dental surgery],"Objective: To describe the anesthetic technique used, the evaluation of airway patency, and the perioperative complications in patients with lower than average intelligence (mentally disabled) who are administered general anesthesia for dental surgery. Material and methods: We carried out a prospective, descriptive, comparative study of mentally disabled ASA 2-3 patients. The patients were distributed in 2 groups: mild to moderate mental disability and severe to very severe mental disability. Induction was via intravenous or inhaled anesthesia depending on availability of venous access. Maintenance was with sevoflurane in oxygen and air at variable concentrations in order to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60. Statistical comparisons were based on the chi2 test, the log-rank test and the t test. Results: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. The anesthetic technique maintained hemodynamic stability in both groups. No statistically significant differences were found in Mallampati classification, Cormack-Lehane classification, or level of disability. The incidence of complications was higher in the group with more severe disability; the most common complication was difficult tracheal intubation. Bradycardia was the most common complication in the group with mild to moderate mental disability. Conclusions: The anesthetic technique used in this study proved to be safe and effective in this type of patient. A higher degree of mental disability led to less effective examination of the airway and more difficult direct laryngoscopy. BIS was as effective for monitoring in this population as it is in the general population.",0,0

A custom device easily assembled using an USB endoscopic camera, a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope blade size 3 or 4, and a personal computer was used. Patients with Mallampati class 1-3 were chosen. Video-laryngoscopy was recorded and reviewed. Twenty-four patients aged 16-68 years, of mean weight 58.46 ± 12.54 (40-86) kg were studied. The glottis could be visualized and intubation could be performed in all patients with 22/24 patients on first attempt. Mean duration of laryngoscopy was 22.17 ± 12.78 (7-59) s. Time taken for intubation, was mean of 28.58 ± 21.01 (9-89) s. Three patients with anticipated difficult airways could be intubated on the first attempt. Minor blood staining of the airway was seen in the video in two patients. Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy grade visualized was 1 in 9/24, 2 in 15/24 patients. Percentage of glottic opening score was 62.29 ± 28.40 (20-100) %. Real-time video could be captured in all cases. The custom-made, inexpensive, video-laryngoscopy device is safe and reliable for clinical use. Real-time visualization and endotracheal intubation were successful in all patients, including those with anticipated difficult airway. Further, this device helps in archiving the video of intubation.",0,0
12873960,Difficult tracheal intubation is more common in obese than in lean patients,"Whether tracheal intubation is more difficult in obese patients is debatable. We compared the incidence of difficult tracheal intubation in obese and lean patients by using a recently validated objective scale, the intubation difficulty scale (IDS). We studied 134 lean (body mass index, <30 kg/m2) and 129 obese (body mass index, >or=35 kg/m2) consecutive patients. The IDS scores, categorized as difficult intubation (IDS >or=>5) or not (IDS <5), and the patient data, including oxygen saturation (SpO2) while breathing oxygen, were compared between lean and obese patients. In addition, risk factors for difficult intubation were determined in obese patients. The IDS score was >or=5 in 3 lean and 20 obese patients (P = 0.0001). A Mallampati score of III-IV was the only independent risk factor for difficult intubation in obese patients (odds ratio, 12.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.01-77.81), but its specificity and positive predictive value were 62% and 29%, respectively. SpO2 values noted during intubation were (mean +/- SD) 99% +/- 1% (range, 91%-100%) and 95% +/- 8% (range, 50%-100%) in lean and obese patients, respectively (P < 0.0001). We conclude that difficult intubation is more common among obese than nonobese patients. None of the classic risk factors for difficult intubation was satisfactory in obese patients. The high risk of desaturation warrants studies to identify new predictors of difficult intubation in the obese. Implications: We report a difficult intubation rate of 15.5% in obese patients and 2.2% in lean patients. None of the risk factors for difficult intubation described in the lean population was satisfactory in the obese patients. We also report a high risk of desaturation in obese patients with difficult intubation.",1,1
10036887,[The clinical usefulness of predicting difficult endotracheal intubation],"We conducted several tests for predicting the difficult intubation airway in 476 patients excluding those with neck disease and anatomical abnormalities. The evaluation was performed using four methods. 1. The size of the tongue in relation to the oral cavity (Mallampani test: M-T). 2. The hyomental distance (H-D). 3. The thyromental distance (T-D). 4. The atranto-occipital joint extension (AOJE). Of these four methods, M-T was the best predictor of a difficult airway. However, all of these four methods may be good predictors, employing modified criteria which include M-T = class 2, 3, 4, H-D = less than 3.0 cm, T-D = less than 6.0 cm, and AOJE = less than 35 degrees.",0,0
25266137,Does a patient's Mallampati score predict outcome after maxillomandibular advancement for obstructive sleep apnoea?,"The Mallampati airway classification has been used to estimate the success of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) but its predictive value in maxillomandibular advancement has not been proved. We aimed to explore the association between preoperative Mallampati scores and surgical outcome after bimaxillary advancement for OSA. We retrospectively analysed data on 50 patients who had maxillofacial operations for OSA at our hospital and stratified them into two groups based on Mallampati scores: high (class III/IV) and low (class I/II). We compared pre- and postoperative apnoea/hypopnoea indices (AHIs), Epworth sleepiness scores, and lowest recorded oxygen saturation in both groups. The postoperative values for all three outcome measures were not significantly different when patients were stratified according to the Mallampati classification (mean (SD) AHI was 41(19) before and 7 (6) after operation in the low group, and 42 (15) before and 9 (7) after in the high group). Success rates (AHI less than 15 postoperatively) were similar in both low and high score groups (p>0.05). Maxillomandibular advancement alleviates obstruction at multiple levels and our study has shown comparable surgical outcomes in both groups. The Mallampati score can be used to optimise patient selection for surgeons considering single-level procedures for OSA. Our study suggests that the Mallampati classification is less useful for the prediction of surgical outcome after maxillomandibular advancement surgery.",0,0

Soft-tissue trauma may exacerbate this condition, causing further ossification. Multisystem involvement includes restrictive lung disease, cervical ankylosis with limited mouth opening, and cardiac dysfunction.

21282035,[Cricothyrotomy in emergency context: assessment of a cannot intubate cannot ventilate scenario],"Objective: The aim of this study was to assess airway management by emergency physicians in case of a simulated situation where intubation and ventilation were both impossible. Study design: Observational manikin study. Methods: A manikin (Airman®; Laerdal) allowing simulating difficult airway situations was used. The scenario assessed concerned a patient needing tracheal intubation for severe traumatic brain injury. The manikin was settled to make tracheal intubation under direct laryngoscopy impossible at the first attempt and to make facemask ventilation impossible after the second attempt. Manikin could initially be ventilated through the intubating laryngeal mask Airway (ILMA) but became impossible few seconds after its insertion. With impossible ventilation through the ILMA, arterial oxygen saturation decreased during 2 minutes before an hypoxic cardiac arrest occurred. Physicians could use classic laryngoscope with Macintosh blade, a Gum Elastic Bougie, an ILMA and a cricothyrotomy set. Adhesion to the national airway management algorithm was assessed. Time to cricothyroidotomy decision after ventilation through ILMA became impossible was measured. Results: Twenty-five emergency physicians were assessed. For 14 of them, national expert conference algorithm was perfectly followed. For ten physicians, cricothyroidotomy decision was taken after hypoxic cardiac arrest occurred. Conclusion: Simulation with a manikin is useful to assess the adhesion rate to difficult intubation algorithms. Our study shows that the decision making process for cricothyrotomy is too often delayed as soon as ventilation became impossible and oxygenation compromized.",0,0
6881849,Difficult laryngoscopy/intubation: the child with mandibular hypoplasia,"The child with mandibular hypoplasia (Treacher Collins syndrome, Pierre Robin sequence, hemifacial microsomia, etc) presents the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist with considerable problems when direct laryngoscopy and/or endotracheal intubation is attempted. In addition to the small mandible, several other features of these patients contribute to the difficult laryngoscopy: macroglossia, glossoptosis, trismus related to temporomandibular joint abnormalities, and prominent maxilla or maxillary incisors. Most of the techniques that have been described for laryngoscopy/intubation in problem cases are difficult or impossible to use in infants and young children with mandibular hypoplasia. We present a modification of the standard direct laryngoscopic procedure, utilizing the 9-cm anterior commissure laryngoscope and an optical stylet in the task of exposing and intubating the larynx of a child with mandibular hypoplasia.",0,0
21996015,Use of the Laryngeal Mask Airway-Aintree Intubating Catheter-fiberoptic bronchoscope technique for difficult intubation,"Study objective: To determine whether intubation using an Aintree Intubation Catheter (AIC), fiberoptic intubation (FOB), and Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is safe and effective for securing the airway in patients who are difficult to intubate after induction of general anesthesia. Design: Retrospective review of departmental difficult airway database procedures completed between July 2006 and December 2009. Setting: Academic medical center. Measurements and main results: During the study period, 128 of 500 patients entered into the difficult airway database underwent the LMA-AIC-FOB technique for intubation. One hundred nineteen (93%) of the 128 patients were successfully intubated by the LMA-AIC-FOB technique, and 9 required an alternate technique. No patient who underwent the LMA-AIC-FOB technique experienced an airway-related mortality or required an emergency surgical airway procedure. Conclusion: The LMA-AIC-FOB technique is safe and effective for patients who are difficult to intubate after induction of anesthesia.",0,0
9067056,Taping methods and tape types for securing oral endotracheal tubes,"Purpose: To evaluate tapes and taping methods with respect to the minimum force required to dislodge endotracheal tubes (ETTs). Methods: A simulated face model consisting of a section of PVC pipe was used. The ETT was attached to a piezo-electric force transducer and pullout force was manually applied in a vertical, right or left direction. Five tape types were tested: Curity, Leukosilk, Hy.tape, Leukopore, and Transpore, Seven taping methods were used to secure the ETT. The methods differed with respect to tape width and whether the tape was split along its longitudinal axis. Each taping condition was replicated 20 times (7 methods x 5 tapes x 3 directions) for a total of 2100 pullout tests. Results: Minimum forces to dislodge ETTs were higher (P < 0.05) with Curity tape (mean +/- SD; 135 +/- 75 N) than with the other tapes (Leukosilk: 93 +/- 51 N, Hy.tape: 78 +/- 34 N, Leukopore: 47 +/- 32, and Transpore: 37 +/- 23 N). The most secure taping method was achieved by taping the ETT, using 2.5 cm wide Curity tape, in a circumferential fashion to both the upper and lower borders of the simulated mouth opening, and reinforcing these tapes with two strips applied longitudinally across the borders of the mouth opening (method 7). Taping methods which involved splitting the tape along its longitudinal axis resulted in lower minimal pullout forces whenever the pullout force was directed towards the side of attachment (P < 0.05 vs right and vertical direction). Conclusion: There are differences in ETT pullout forces and mechanisms of dislodgement depending on taping method and tape type.",0,0
12928095,Laryngopharyngeal sensory testing and assessment of airway protection in pediatric patients,"Infant and pediatric feeding and swallowing disorders may result from a variety of diseases, including pneumonia, neurologic disorders, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) technique has been successfully used for evaluation in adult and pediatric swallowing disorders. A recent study demonstrated that FEES with sensory testing can be incorporated into evaluation of pediatric cases with relative safety. As seen in adults, pediatric patients with an increased laryngopharyngeal sensory threshold (LPST) have a significantly higher likelihood of laryngeal reflux penetration and aspiration during a feeding assessment. Additionally, the study using sensory testing found a possible correlation between a history of GERD and an increased LPST. Thus, further examination using LPST testing in pediatric patients is recommended.",0,0
26945383,An Evaluation of Thyromental Distance-based Method or Weight-based Method in Determining the Size of the Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme: A Randomized Controlled Study,"The successful placement of Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Supreme in adults largely depends on right selection of its size. Most anesthesiologists determine the size of LMA according to patients' body weight, which does not always work well. An alternative method should be established to guarantee higher efficacy of ventilation through LMA Supreme placement. This controlled study was designed to compare the efficacy of LMA Supreme placement, when the size of it is determined by body weight or by thyromental distance. Eighty healthy individuals with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 to 2 scheduled for elective ambulatory surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: thyromental distance-based group (n = 40) and weight-based group (n = 40). Efficacy of controlled ventilation through LMA, easy of device placement, and pharyngeal sealing were evaluated between the groups. The tidal volume under 10 cm H2O pressure-controlled ventilation in thyromental distance-based group was significantly higher than that in weight-based group (523.9 ± 135.4 vs 477.1 ± 185.6; P = 0.031). The number of patients who achieved ""excellent"" tidal volume (>8 mL/kg) were significantly more in the thyromental distance-based group (24/40 vs 13/40; P = 0.019). Among overweight patients (body mass index >23), those who achieved ""excellent"" tidal volume (>8 mL/kg) under 10 cm H2O pressure-controlled ventilation were also more in thyromental distanced-based group than in weight-based group (11/24 vs 2/24; P = 0.031). The time taken for successful insertion was shorter with the thyromental distance-based group compared with the weight-based group (54.6 ± 33.6 vs 87.8 ± 98.9; P = 0.021). Oropharyngeal leak pressure was pretty close between the 2 groups (26.4 ± 5.1 vs 25.0 ± 5.7 cm H2O; P = 0.180). In terms of guaranteeing better positive pressure ventilation, facilitating device placement, and reliable pharyngeal sealing, thyromental distance-based method can be a better option compared with the weight-based method for LMA Supreme size selection.",0,0
27407698,Local Anaesthesia for Fiberoptic Intubation : A Comparison of Three Techniques,"Background: The successful conduct of fiberoptic aided intubation is dependent upon effective local anaesthesia. The aim of the study was to compare three different methods of anaesthetizing the airway. Methods: 60 adult patients (American Society of Anaesthesiologists status I-III and Mallampati class III & IV), scheduled for elective surgery, received sedation followed by spraying of the nares and posterior pharyngeal wall with 4% lignocaine. Thereafter the patients received 4 ml of 4% lignocaine either by transtracheal injection (n=20, group A), via intubating fiberscope (Pentax F1-10P2) using 'spray as you go' technique (n=20, group B) or by nebulizer (Devilbiss 5610W) 20 min before intubation, (n=20, group C). Patients were asked to score the procedure using visual analog scale (VAS) and severity scores. Episodes of coughing, choking, stridor, extra / total local anaesthetic used and intubation times were recorded. Patients were monitored continuously for vital parameters. Results: Group B patients showed better VAS scores with shorter intubation times and had a lower incidence of coughing and choking. The endoscopists' VAS scores also showed a preference for group B. Conclusion: In conclusion the 'spray as you go' technique was safe, provided effective local anaesthesia and was preferred by both patients and endoscopists.",0,0
1941691,Difficult intubation--when can we predict it?,"Anaesthetists at times encounter difficult intubation in an apparently normal individual in spite of using the best possible positioning and most profound relaxation. This study was carried out to find out the most simple and easy measurement that may predict a difficult intubation. The study was conducted in three groups of patients of twenty each. The first group consisted of patients in whom intubation was easy. Second group consisted of anticipated difficult intubation. Cases in whom very difficult intubation was encountered were analyzed retrospectively and were included in third group. An attempt has been made to predict difficult intubation with the roentgenographic study of lateral view of mandible along with the measurement of distance from chin to thyroid cartilage. Of all the parameters, ratio of effective mandibular length to posterior mandibular depth and distance from chin to thyroid cartilage were found to be important to predict difficult intubation.",0,0
23710682,Effect of epidural analgesia on change in Mallampati class during labour,"Mallampati class has been shown to increase during labour. Epidural analgesia might influence this change. The aim of our study was to compare the change in Mallampati class during labour in parturients who did and did not receive epidural analgesia and study the association of these changes with pre-defined clinical characteristics. We performed a prospective observational study of 190 parturients. Using standard methodology, photographs of the upper airway were taken with a digital camera during early labour and within 90 min of delivery. Two to three consultant anaesthetists, blinded to the origin of the photographs, evaluated the images obtained and assigned a Mallampati class to each. Overall, Mallampati class increased in 61 (32.1%), decreased in 18 (9.5%) and did not change in 111 (58.4%) parturients (p<0.001). The proportions of parturients in the epidural and non-epidural groups who demonstrated an increase, decrease and no change in Mallampati class were similar. Of the relationships between change in Mallampati class and the other factors studied, only the total dose of epidural levobupivacaine during labour demonstrated a weak positive correlation 0.17 (p=0.039) with Mallampati class. This study confirms that labour is associated with an increase in the Mallampati class in approximately one third of parturients. Our findings indicate that having an epidural does not influence the likelihood of a change in Mallampati class during labour.",0,0
19457671,An assessment of the predictors of difficult intubation in patients with acromegaly,"Various clinical signs have been used for assessing difficult intubation in patients with acromegaly. These signs include the modified Mallampati classification, measurement of thyromental distance and head and neck movements. Some authors have also tried to establish a relationship between growth hormone levels and difficult intubation. We hypothesized that duration of symptoms in patients with acromegaly may have an association with difficult airway and difficult laryngoscopy. In this prospective study we evaluated tests of airway assessment such as: (i) the Mallampati grade; (ii) the thyromental distance; and (iii) the laryngoscopic grade (Cormack-Lehane). The growth hormone levels and the duration of disease symptoms were also examined. Significant correlation was observed between the Cormack-Lehane and Mallampati gradings (p = 0.05; rho = 19.3%), and between the thyromental distance and the duration of the symptoms (p = 0.03; rho = 26.9%). The incidence of Mallampati III and IV grades was higher in patients with acromegaly. Increased thyromental distance was noted in patients with a long duration of disease. However, increased thyromental distance was not associated with difficult laryngoscopy.",1,1
15249803,Emergency physicians and rapid sequence intubation: a survey of Scottish teaching hospitals,"Objectives: Emergency definitive airway management is a fundamental skill for physicians in the emergency department. The aim of this survey was to determine the perceived confidence in the assessment and control of the emergency airway, including rapid sequence intubation, among physicians in Scottish teaching hospital emergency departments. Methods: A postal survey of senior and middle-grade physicians in seven Scottish teaching hospital emergency departments. Results: The response rate was 78% (47/60). A total of 98% of physicians rated their confidence at assessing the difficult airway as 'reasonable' to 'very high'; 79% were confident concerning their ability to administer drugs to facilitate emergency intubation; 47% had used drugs for emergency intubation within the month preceding the survey, and 72% had done so within the 6 months before the survey. Consultants were more confident than trainees, as were those possessing the Fellow of the Royal College of Anaesthetists qualification or a Diploma in Anaesthetics (UK). Those possessing the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists qualification had all performed a rapid sequence intubation within the past month. Conclusion: Physicians in Scottish teaching hospital emergency departments have high levels of self-rated confidence in assessment and their ability to secure the emergency airway utilizing drugs to facilitate emergency intubation. Consultants and those with anaesthetic qualifications are more confident than trainees and those without such a qualification.",0,0
22174470,Improvement in Cormack and Lehane grading with laparoscopic assistance during tracheal intubation,"Background: To use laparoscope as an easily available and easy to use alternative option to videolaryngoscope. Aims: The aim of the study was to assess the improvement in the glottic view using a conventional direct laryngoscope (DL) assisted by a laparoscope with its endovision system along with the time taken for tracheal intubation. Settings and design: A prospective, double blind, randomized, controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care centre. Methods: Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II requiring general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation for elective surgery were included in the study. The patients were anaesthetized, paralysed, DL was performed and Cormack and Lehane grade (C and L) noted, followed by the introduction of the laparoscope alongside the flange of the Macintosh laryngoscope and a further C and L grading done as seen on monitor. Demographic data, ASA physical status, airway assessment, mouth opening, modified Mallampatti class, jaw protrusion, thyromental and sternomental distances, optimal external laryngeal manipulation, time taken for intubation, pulse oximetry, blood on; tracheal tube, lip, dentition or mucosal trauma, sore throat, hoarseness of voice, excessive secretions and regurgitation were recorded. Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was done using statistics package for social sciences software (17.0 version). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Eighty-three percent of the patients showed improvement in glottic view after laparoscopic assistance. Eighty-one and 85% of the patients with C and L grade II and III respectively on DL had an improved glottic view with this technique. The mean time to intubate was 37 seconds. Conclusions: Laparoscopic assistance provided a better glottic view than DL in most patients (83%). It has a potential advantage over standard DL in difficult intubation.",0,0
21498930,Resting metabolic rate and anthropometric measurements in male sleep apnea patients,"Objective: Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder. Associations among Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), body habitus differences, and otorhinolaryngologic abnormality may clarify the characteristics of patients with OSAS. In order to test this hypothesis, we aimed to compare the RMR, Modified Mallampati Scores (MMS), anthropometric measurements and body composition of male OSAS patients with simple snorers and to investigate the association among these parameters. Methods: MMS were calculated, overnight polysomnography was performed, body mass index, neck, shoulder, chest, waist, hip and abdomen circumferences, body fat amount and ratio, lean body weight, body water amount and RMR were measured for all of the patients. Patients: Ninety-eight male patients with suspected OSAS were included in the study. Results: Fifty-one patients were diagnosed as OSAS and 47 patients were diagnosed as simple snorers. RMR, total body water, neck, shoulder and chest circumferences were significantly higher in OSAS patients than the simple snorers. The majority of the simple snorers was seen to have a MMS of stage 2 whereas OSAS patients had MMS of stages 3 and 4. AHI was significantly correlated with neck, shoulder, chest circumferences, total body water amount, MMS and RMR. Chest girth was found as the most important single predictor of sleep apnea in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: We suggest that the increased RMR and chest circumference might have occurred due to the condition resulting from the elevated AHI in patients with OSAS. Mallampati score should be routinely evaluated in OSAS patients.",0,0
24024531,"A prospective study of physician pre-hospital anaesthesia in trauma patients: oesophageal intubation, gross airway contamination and the 'quick look' airway assessment","Background: In trauma patients intubated in a physician-led pre-hospital trauma service we prospectively examined the rate of misplaced tracheal tubes, the presence and nature of gross airway contamination, and the value of 'quick look' airway assessment to identify patients with subsequent difficult laryngoscopy. Methods: Patients requiring pre-hospital intubation in a 16 month period were included. Intubation success rate, misplaced tracheal tube rate, Cormack and Lehane grade, and the presence and nature of gross airway contamination were recorded at laryngoscopy. Tube placement was verified with carbon dioxide detection and chest x-ray. After visual assessment physicians stated whether laryngoscopy was expected to be a straightforward or 'difficult'. The assessment was compared to subsequent laryngoscopy grade. Results: 400 patients had attempted intubation and 399 were successfully intubated. 42 were in cardiac arrest and intubated without drugs. There were no oesophageal or misplaced tracheal tubes. Gross airway contamination was reported in 177 of 400 patients (44%), of which ¾ was from the upper airway. Unconscious patients had higher contamination rates (57%) than conscious patients (34%) (p ≤ 0.0001). As a test of difficult intubation, the 'quick look' generated sensitivity 0.597 and specificity 0.763 (PPV and NPV were 0.336 and 0.904 respectively). Conclusion: This study suggests that when physicians perform pre-hospital anaesthesia they have high intubation success rates and the use of ETCO2 monitoring reduces or eliminates undetected misplaced tracheal tubes. We found high rates of airway contamination; mostly blood from the upper airway. The 'quick look' airway assessment had some utility but is unreliable in isolation.",0,0
21633566,Prediction of difficult intubations using conventional indicators: Does rapid sequence intubation ease difficult intubations? A prospective randomised study in a tertiary care teaching hospital,"Background: Endotracheal intubations performed in the Emergency Department. Aims: To assess whether conventional indicators of difficult airway can predict a difficult intubation in the Emergency Setting and to investigate the effect of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) on ease of intubation. Settings and design: A prospective randomized study was designed involving 60 patients requiring intubation, over a period of 4 months. Materials and methods: Demographic profile, details of methods used, airway assessment, ease of intubation, and Cormack and Lehane score were recorded. Airway assessment score and ease of intubation criteria were devised and assessed. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. Chi-square/2 × 2, 2 × 3, 3 × 3, Fisher Exact test have been used to find the significance of study parameters on categorical scale between two or more groups. Results: Patients with a Mallampatti score of three or four were found to have worse laryngoscopic views (Cormack-Lehane score, 3 or 4). Of all airway indicators assessed, an increased Mallampatti score was found to have significant correlation with increased difficulty in intubation. The use of RSI was associated with better laryngoscopic views, and easier intubations. Conclusions: An airway assessment using the Mallampatti score is invaluable as a tool to predict a difficult airway and should be performed routinely if possible. RSI aids intubation ease. If not otherwise contraindicated, it should be performed routinely for all intubations in the ED.",0,0
21804626,Can difficult intubation be easily and rapidly predicted?,"Aim: Failed endotracheal intubation and inadequate ventilation with subsequent insufficient oxygenation can result in serious complications potentially leading to permanent health damage. Difficult intubation may occur not only in patients with apparent pathologies in the orofacial region but also, unexpectedly, in those without abnormalities. This study aimed at finding anthropometric parameters that are easy to examine and that would aid in predicting difficult intubation. Method: A case-control study was undertaken. Based on defined criteria, 15 parameters were examined in patients with unanticipated difficult intubation. The parameters included a previous history of difficult intubation, pathologies associated with difficult intubation, clinical symptoms of airway pathology, the Mallampati score, upper lip bite test, receding mandible, and cervical spine and temporomandibular joint movement. Thyromental, hyomental and sternomental distances and inter-incisor gap were measured. The methods were precisely defined and the measurements were carried out by a trained anesthesiologist. Statistical analysis was performed on data from 74 patients with difficult intubation and 74 control patients with easy intubation. Results: Significant predictors of difficult intubation were inter-incisor gap (IIG), thyromental distance (TMD) and class 3 limited movement of the temporomandibular joint. The IIG and TMD cut-offs were set at 42 mm and 93 mm, respectively. Conclusion: The results will be used to confirm these predictors in an anesthesiology clinic along with the aid of the laryngoscopic findings to improve the prediction of unanticipated difficult intubation.",1,1

22251105,Easy and difficult nasal intubation--a randomised comparison of Macintosh vs Airtraq® laryngoscopes,"A new Airtraq(®) laryngoscope has been developed for nasal intubation. We prospectively compared tracheal intubation efficiency of the Airtraq for nasotracheal intubation vs that of the Macintosh laryngoscope in 200 patients. Depending on pre-operative airway evaluation, the patients were allocated to expected easy (n = 100) or difficult (n = 100) intubation groups, on the basis of mouth opening ≤ 2.5 cm, modified Mallampati score of 4, history of difficult intubation, obvious tumour or swelling. Patients were randomly allocated to the Macintosh or nasotracheal Airtraq technique. All easy intubations were successfully performed with the respective technique. In the expected difficult intubation group, the success rate was higher (47/50 vs 33/50; p < 0.01), the glottis view was better (Cormack and Lehane 1/2/3/4 grades: 29/17/1/3 vs 5/11/18/16, p < 0.01), mean (SD) intubation time was shorter (45(46) s vs 77(47)s, p < 0.01) and the number of optimising manoeuvres was reduced with the nasotracheal Airtraq compared with the Macintosh, respectively.

Design: Prospective observational study. Settings: Tertiary/National referral airway reconstruction centre. Participants: Fourty tracheostomy-free patients undergoing endoscopic airway examination/laryngotracheoplasty. Main outcome measures: Demographic and clinical information, obtained from patient records, lesion severity, which was recorded intraoperatively, standard spirometry, which was measured preoperatively, and the MRC dyspnoea scale, which was administered preoperatively and at the first outpatient visit 4-6 weeks later. Results: There were 16 males and 24 females. Mean age at presentation was 44 +/- 14 years (+/- SD). Postintubation stenosis was the commonest aetiology (73%) followed by idiopathic subglottic stenosis and Wegener's Granulomatosis. Six patients were examined post-treatment and had minimal residual stenosis and the remaining patients had glottic stenosis (n = 11) or Myer-Cotton Grade I (n = 8), II (n = 7) or III (n = 8) tracheal stenoses. Pre-treatment MRC dyspnoea scores and the degree of change in the MRC score following treatment strongly correlated with pre-treatment stenosis severity (r = 0.75 and r = -0.71 respectively; P < .001). Moreover statistically significant correlations existed between preoperative peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in 1 s and preoperative MRC dyspnoea scores (r = -0.34 and r = -0.35 respectively; P < 0.05). Discussion: Exertional dyspnoea is the hallmark symptom of laryngotracheal stenosis and for many patients it is the primary cause of disability. These findings confirm that the MRC dyspnoea scale is an appropriate outcome instrument for assessing dyspnoea associated with this condition.",0,0
8297572,Tracheobronchomalacia in children,"Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is an important cause of airway distress during infancy, but it generally resolves as the airway enlarges. To assess the origin and natural history of TBM, a chart review and telephone survey were conducted for 50 patients with TBM at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Pa). This study revealed that TBM is a relatively common airway abnormality and is found on 15% of all diagnostic bronchoscopies. Prematurity, low birth weight, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and prolonged ventilation predispose patients to the most severe symptoms. In our study, a tracheotomy with continuous positive airway pressure was required by 75% of the premature infants and 25% of the full-term infants with TBM. Seventy-one percent of all patients underwent decannulation without any other surgical intervention and remained nearly asymptomatic. Some patients could not undergo decannulation because of other airway lesions. In most instances, TBM is a self-limited disease that resolves without surgery.",0,0
23328380,[Effects of different nasotracheal intubations in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome patients with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty],"Objective: To explore the safe and effective way of nasotracheal intubations in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome patients with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Methods: Upon the approval of the Ethics Committee at Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, from August 2008 to November 2011, 90 sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome patients were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=30 each): GlideScope (G), fiberoptic bronchoscope (F) and combination of Glidescope with fiberoptic bronchoscope (G+F). The parameters of tracheal intubation time, placement of endotracheal intubation, tracheal injury and complications were recorded. Also systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded at post-induction, the moment of tracheal intubation and post-intubation 1, 3, 5 min. Rate pressure product (RPP) was calculated at all time points as the product of heart rate and SBP during observation. Results: All of them underwent successful endotracheal intubation. There were 24 successful cases of intubation during the first attempt in Group G with a success rate of 80%; 27 patients successful during the first attempt in group F with a success rate of 90%; all in group G+F successful during the first attempt with a success rate of 100%. The rates were significantly different in 3 groups (P<0.05). Groups G and F patients with failed intubation during the first attempt were of Mallampati III/IV. After induction, SBP, DBP, MAP and RPP were lower in 3 groups (P<0.05) while HR change was not obvious. Compared with the after induction, the moment of tracheal intubation and after intubation 1 min, 3 groups of patients with SBP, DBP, MAP, HR and RPP increased (P<0.05). Groups F and G+F after intubation in intubated patients and 1 min of SBP, DBP, MAP, HR, RPP were higher than G group (P<0.05). No difference existed between groups F and G+F. Three groups showed no serious tracheal injury, laryngeal edema, hoarseness or other complications. Conclusion: During nasotracheal intubation for Mallampati I/II patients, GlideScope offers better overall glottic views. For those of Mallampati III and IV, the combination of Glidescope with fiberoptic bronchoscope may achieve a higher success rate and shorter intubation time than the latter alone.",0,0
11465621,The effect of sevoflurane and desflurane on upper airway reactivity,"Background: Although bronchial reactivity can be assessed by changes in airway resistance, there is no well-accepted measure of upper airway reactivity during anesthesia. The authors used the stimulus of endotracheal tube cuff inflation and deflation to assess changes in airway reactivity in patients anesthetized with sevoflurane and desflurane. Methods: Sixty-four patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II participated in this randomized, double-blind study. Patients were anesthetized with either sevoflurane or desflurane at 1.0 and 1.8 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The trachea was stimulated by inflating the endotracheal tube cuff. A blinded observer assessed the severity of patient response to the stimulus and changes in hemodynamic variables. The process was repeated at the second MAC treatment condition. Results: At 1.0 MAC, patients anesthetized with desflurane had a more intense response and a greater likelihood of significant coughing and associated hemodynamic changes (both at P < 0.05). At 1.8 MAC, sevoflurane and desflurane both suppressed clinically significant responses to tracheal stimulation. Interrater reliability was excellent for this measure of upper airway reactivity (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The assessment of the cough response to tracheal stimulation by endotracheal tube cuff inflation is a reliable and clinically meaningful measure of upper airway reactivity. At 1.0 MAC, sevoflurane is superior to desflurane for suppressing moderate and severe responses to this stimulus.",0,0
1854060,[Intratracheal intubation using a fiberoptic laryngoscope],"Experience with a new type of laryngoscope (Bullard) is reported. It weighs 1,200 kg, and has fiberoptic fibers both for lighting and viewing. Angle of vision is about 55 degrees. Endotracheal intubation with this device requires a semi-rigid stylet to bend the tracheal tube at 90 degrees just above its cuff, so as to reproduce the curvature of the laryngoscope blade. Intubation is carried out in five steps: 1) introducing the laryngoscope blade, and visualising the vocal cords through its lens; 2) introducing the tube with its stylet, just above the laryngoscope blade; 3) placing the tube between the vocal cords under fiberoptic vision; 4) adjusting tube position in the trachea, the stylet still in place; 5) removing both stylet and laryngoscope. The use of this apparatus in an obese patient with reduced mobility of the cervical spine, who was ranked 4 on the Mallampati scale, is reported. The Bullard laryngoscope enabled easy tracheal intubation (duration 1 min 30 s), whereas direct laryngoscopy and the use of a Huffman prism were unsuccessful. The fiberoptic laryngoscope may be of help in case of difficult intubation.",0,0
17717215,The use of three-dimensional computed tomography images for anticipated difficult intubation airway evaluation of a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome,A 13-year-old girl with Treacher Collins syndrome who had a history of difficult intubation was scheduled for plastic surgery. We took three-dimensional computed tomography images to better evaluate the anatomical features of the upper airway. The patient's anesthetic airway management was influenced by the findings of the images.,0,0
15321932,Intubating laryngeal mask airway allows tracheal intubation when the cervical spine is immobilized by a rigid collar,"Background: An intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) facilitates tracheal intubation with the neck in neutral position, which is similar to the neck position maintained by a rigid cervical collar. However, a cervical collar virtually obliterates neck movement, even small movements that normally facilitate airway insertion. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the ILMA will allow tracheal intubation even in patients wearing a rigid cervical collar. Methods: We performed blind tracheal intubation via an ILMA under general anaesthesia in 50 patients with a rigid Philadelphia collar in place undergoing cervical spine surgery and 50 general surgical patients. Time required for intubation, intubation success rate, and numbers and type of adjusting manoeuvres used were recorded. Results: Inter-incisor distance was significantly smaller (4.1 (0.8) vs 4.6 (0.7) cm, mean (sd), P<0.01) and Mallampati scores were significantly greater (P<0.001) in the patients with collars. ILMA insertion took longer (30 (25) vs 22 (6) s), more patients required two insertion attempts (15 vs 3; P<0.005), and ventilation adequacy with ILMA was worse (P<0.05) in collared patients. However, there were no significant differences between the collars and control patients in terms of total time required for intubation (60 (41) vs 50 (30) s), number of intubation attempts, overall intubation success rate (96 vs 98%), or the incidence of intubation complications. Conclusions: Blind intubation through an ILMA is thus a reasonable strategy for controlling the airway in patients who are immobilized with a rigid cervical collar.",0,0
25681041,A comparison between left molar direct laryngoscopy and the use of a Bonfils intubation fibrescope for tracheal intubation in a simulated difficult airway,"Background: Tracheal intubation in patients with an immobilized cervical spine can be difficult because of a restricted mouth opening and limited neck movements. Use of the Bonfils intubation fibrescope (BIF) or left molar (LM) laryngoscopy may be suitable options for tracheal intubation in such patients. Intubation adjuncts, such as an endotracheal tube introducer, may improve the overall intubation success rate with the LM approach. Formal studies are currently lacking on the use of LM laryngoscopy with a tube introducer. Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, a cervical collar (to simulate a difficult airway scenario) was placed on 120 prospective elective surgical patients who were randomly assigned to tracheal intubation with a BIF (Group BIF, n = 60) or with tube introducer-assisted LM laryngoscopy with routine optimal external laryngeal manipulation (Group LM, n = 60). The groups were compared for the primary endpoint, total intubation time, as well as for time to glottic view, tube introducer insertion time, intubation success rate, number of intubation attempts, and airway complications. Results: The mean (SD) total time for intubation was longer in Group LM than in Group BIF [40.4 (14.2) sec vs 33.1 (15.4) sec, respectively; mean difference 7.3 sec; 99% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 14.4; P < 0.001] despite less mean (SD) total time required for glottic view [15.4 (10.3) sec vs 23.8 (15.7) sec, respectively; mean difference 8.3 sec; 99% CI 2.3 to 14.7; P < 0.001]. The overall success rate was comparable between groups (95.0% in Group BIF vs 96.6% in Group LM; P = 0.64). Tracheal intubations could not be performed as per protocol in three patients in Group BIF and in two patients in Group LM and were considered as failures. No differences between the groups were found in the incidence of side effects. Conclusion: The tube introducer-assisted LM approach to intubation may be a good alternative to the BIF approach in patients with anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway scenarios.",0,0
22965285,Total airway reconstruction,"We present a case of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that required multilevel surgical correction of the airway and literature review and discuss the role supraglottic laryngeal collapse can have in OSA. A 34-year-old man presented to a tertiary otolaryngology clinic for treatment of OSA. He previously had nasal and palate surgeries and a Repose tongue suspension. His residual apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was 67. He had a dysphonia associated with a true vocal cord paralysis following resection of a benign neck mass in childhood. He also complained of inspiratory stridor with exercise and intolerance to continuous positive airway pressure. Physical examination revealed craniofacial hypoplasia, full base of tongue, and residual nasal airway obstruction. On laryngoscopy, the paretic aryepiglottic fold arytenoid complex prolapsed into the laryngeal inlet with each breath. This was more pronounced with greater respiratory effort. Surgical correction required a series of operations including awake tracheostomy, supraglottoplasty, midline glossectomy, genial tubercle advancement, maxillomandibular advancement, and reconstructive rhinoplasty. His final AHI was 1.9. Our patient's supraglottic laryngeal collapse constituted an area of obstruction not typically evaluated in OSA surgery. In conjunction with treating nasal, palatal, and hypopharyngeal subsites, our patient's supraglottoplasty represented a key component of his success. This case illustrates the need to evaluate the entire upper airway in a complicated case of OSA.",0,0
24152537,Incidence of unanticipated difficult airway using an objective airway score versus a standard clinical airway assessment: the DIFFICAIR trial - trial protocol for a cluster randomized clinical trial,"Background: Pre-operative airway assessment in Denmark is based on a non-specific clinical assessment. Systematic, evidence-based and consistent airway assessment may reduce the incidence of unanticipated difficult airway management. By assessing multiple predictors for difficult airway management, the predictive value of the assessment increases. The Simplified Airway Risk Index (SARI) is a multivariate risk score for predicting difficult intubation.This study aims to compare the use of the SARI with a non-specified clinical airway assessment on predicting difficult intubation. Further, to compare the examination and registration of predictors for difficult mask ventilation with a non-specified clinical airway assessment on prediction of difficult mask ventilation. Method/design: We cluster-randomized 28 Danish departments of anaesthesia to airway assessment either by the SARI or by usual non-specific assessment. Data from patients' pre-operative airway assessment are registered in the Danish Anaesthesia Database. Objective scores for intubation and mask ventilation grade the severity of airway managements. The accuracy of predicting difficult intubation and mask ventilation is measured for each group. The primary outcome measure is the fraction of unanticipated difficult and easy intubation.The fraction of unanticipated difficult intubation in Denmark is 1.87%. With a stratified randomization, type 1 error risk of 5% and a power of 80%, 30 departments are required to detect or reject a 30% relative risk reduction equalling a number needed to treat of 180. Sample size estimation is adjusted for the study design and based on standards for randomization on cluster-level. With an average cluster size of 2,500 patients, 70,000 patients will be enrolled over a 1-year trial period. The database is programmed so that registration of the SARI and predictors for difficult mask ventilation are mandatory for the intervention group but invisible to controls. Discussion: It is innovative to use a national clinical database as the basis for a randomized clinical trial. The method can serve as a precedent for implementation of evidence-based recommendations and database registration.The trial will forward understanding of how to predict and reduce unanticipated difficult airways and how to produce evidence-based recommendations for airway assessment and clinical database development.

18051093,Fiducial-free registration procedure for navigated bronchoscopy,"Navigated bronchoscopy has been developed by various groups within the last decades. Systems based on CT data and electromagnetic tracking enable the visualization of the position and orientation of the bronchoscope, forceps, and biopsy tools within CT data. Therefore registration between the tracking space and the CT volume is required. Standard procedures are based on point-based registration methods that require selecting corresponding natural landmarks in both coordinate systems by the examiner. We developed a novel algorithm for a fully automatic registration procedure in navigated bronchoscopy based on the trajectory recorded during routine examination of the airways at the beginning of an intervention. The proposed system provides advantages in terms of an unchanged medical workflow and high accuracy. We compared the novel method with point-based and ICP-based registration. Experiments demonstrate that the novel method transforms up to 97% of tracking points inside the segmented airways, which was the best performance compared to the other methods.",0,0
14566509,The combination of a fiberoptic stylet and a McCoy laryngoscope facilitates tracheal intubation in difficult airway cases,"Purpose: Fiberoptic stylets are considered useful for difficult airway management. In the present study, we assessed the usefulness of a fiberoptic stylet when the stylet was used with a Macintosh or a McCoy laryngoscope. Methods: Twenty-four patients, whose airways were graded as Cormack grade III, were studied. We compared the times required for tracheal intubation when the fiberoptic stylet was used with a Macintosh direct laryngoscope and when it was used with a McCoy laryngoscope. Cormack grade III was subdivided into IIIa (with distance between the epiglottis and the posterior wall of the pharynx) and IIIb (with no distance between the epiglottis and the posterior wall of the pharynx), according to the view of the vocal cords by the laryngoscope. Results: The intubation time in grade IIIb patients, who were intubated by the concurrent use of the fiberoptic stylet and the McCoy laryngoscope (28 +/- 4 s), was not significantly different from that in grade IIIa patients (28 +/- 10 s). The intubation time in grade IIIb patients, who were intubated by the concurrent use of the fiberoptic stylet and the Macintosh laryngoscope (52 +/- 8 s), was significantly longer than that in grades IIIa (28 +/- 10 s; P < 0.01) or IIIb with the McCoy laryngoscope (28 +/- 4 s; P < 0.01). Conclusion: The combination of a new handy fiberoptic stylet and a McCoy laryngoscope facilitated tracheal intubation of patients whose airway had no distance between the epiglottis and the posterior wall of the pharynx in laryngoscopic vocal cord view.",0,0
26229015,Virtual endoscopy--a new assessment tool in difficult airway management,"Preemptive mapping of the airway is a useful adjunct to conventional clinical assessments when airway management planning for patients with complex head and neck pathology. Nasendoscopy is frequently used for this purpose but is also invasive and poorly tolerated in a subset of patients and, even in expert hands, may not allow complete visualization of the glottis and subglottic structures. We present a novel tool for difficult airway management planning in the form of virtual endoscopy by applying free online OsiriX software to head and neck computed tomographic scans to generate a ""fly-through"" airway reconstruction. To highlight how well virtual endoscopy correlates to conventional fibreoscopy, we compare both of these assessment tools in 3 patients with glottic, subglottic, and multilevel airway pathologies. Virtual endoscopy represents a unique, noninvasive, safe, and accurate airway assessment and educational resource, which warrants further exploration.",0,0
9605681,The glottic aperture seal airway: a new ventilatory device,"Background: None of the presently used airway devices are ideal regarding ease of insertion, alignment with the laryngeal inlet, and provision of a high-pressure seal from the environment. The purpose of this study was to determine, in awake volunteers, the performance of a new ventilatory device, the glottic aperture seal airway, regarding ease of insertion, alignment with the laryngeal inlet, and forced exhalation seal pressure (PFES). Methods: The glottic aperture seal airway consists of a curved tubular component that ends in the middle of an elliptical foam cushion glottic component. The posterior surface of the foam has a curved flexible plastic backing, which imparts a 60 degree angle between the proximal half and the distal half of the foam cushion. When the glottic aperture seal airway is properly in situ in a supine patient, the proximal half of the foam cushion is opposite the laryngeal inlet. The posterior surface of the plastic backing has a balloon attached to it. Inflation of the balloon presses the ventilation hole and foam cushion up against the laryngeal inlet, thereby creating a seal from the environment. Using the laryngeal mask airway as a control device, the glottic aperture seal airway was tested for time and ease of insertion, fiberoptic alignment with the laryngeal inlet, and PFES in 18 lightly sedated and locally anesthetized volunteers. Results: The glottic aperture seal and laryngeal mask airways were inserted with equal ease and speed. The fiberoptic alignment with the larynx was excellent for both the glottic aperture seal and laryngeal mask airways. In all volunteers, the mean +/- SD PFES values at 0-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-ml balloon inflation volumes of the glottic aperture seal airway were 23.4 +/- 11.8, 29.6 +/- 12.4, 42.7 +/- 12.5, 56.9 +/- 5.6, and 60 +/- 0 cm H2O, respectively; the PFES at > or = 20 ml balloon inflation volume of the glottic aperture seal airway was significantly greater than with the laryngeal mask airway (19.4 +/- 6.7 cm H2O, P < 0.01). A PFES of > or =60 cm H2O was achieved with the glottic aperture seal airway in all volunteers (n = 2 at 10 ml, n = 3 at 20 ml, n = 9 at 30 ml, and n = 4 at 40 ml). The glottic aperture seal airway did not cause any trauma. Conclusion: In awake volunteers, the glottic aperture seal and laryngeal mask airways were equally easy to insert and position. The glottic aperture seal airway was capable of achieving a higher PFES than the laryngeal mask airway.",0,0
8865717,[Mouth mask method for fiberoptic tracheal intubation in difficult intubations],"We tried 72 fiberoptic tracheal intubations (FTI) using a mouth mask in difficult intubation cases. In this method, ventilation is performed via only the mouth using a mask applied over the mouth (mouth mask) and FTI can be done via a nostril with no hindrance from the mask in anesthetized patients. We have been using an infant or child type Seal Mask (Gibeck Respiration) for the mouth mask or a specially made mouth mask. An oral airway is usually inserted and the nostril of one side is plugged with cotton. FTI is performed by another anesthesiologist. An endotracheal (ET) tube capped with a rubber diaphragm is passed through another nostril, and a fiberscope is inserted through the ET tube. The subsequent technique is the same as that of the usual FTI for awake patients. Intubations were successful in all cases except 2; in one, ventilation was impaired even with oral airway in place, and in the other, bleeding in upper airway due to jaw injury from traffic accident hindered the sight of the scope. Mouth mask method for FTI is safe, useful and practical in difficult intubations with little discomfort to the patient.",0,0
20299983,A simplified risk score to predict difficult intubation: development and prospective evaluation in 3763 patients,"Background and objective: Despite the presence of numerous preoperative tests to predict a difficult airway, there is no reliable bedside method. The aim of this study was to create and verify a simplified risk model with an acceptable discriminating power. Methods: A total of 3763 patients from two university hospitals were screened for potential risk factors for difficult intubation, defined as needing additional technical or human resources, more than three attempts or duration more than 10 min. A random sample (n = 2509) was subjected to multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, and the most powerful independent risk factors were used to build a simplified model that was applied to a validation dataset (n = 1254). Results: The following factors (odds ratio) were associated with a difficult intubation: presence of upper front teeth (3.61), history of difficult intubation (2.88), any Mallampati status different from '1' (2.55) or equal to '4' (1.91) and mouth opening less than 4 cm (1.80). The discriminating power of the score was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.63-0.81). The likelihood for a difficult intubation increases continuously from 0 (when no risk factor is present) to 2, 4, 8 and 17%, when one, two, three and more than three factors are present. Conclusion: The new simplified multivariate risk score for difficult intubation may prove to be useful in clinical practice for predicting a difficult airway. Presence of upper front teeth, a history of difficult intubation, any Mallampati status different from '1' and equal to '4' and mouth opening less than 4 cm are independent risk factors for difficult endotracheal intubation. With each of these risk factors, the likelihood increases from 0 (when no risk factor is present) to 17% (when four or five factors are present).",0,0
22590950,[Survey of patients presented with severely difficult intubation in Hokkaido University Hospital (2005-2010)],"Background: Recently, in addition to bronchofiberscope, the new equipments to manage difficult intubation are available. However, it is unknown whether the incidence of difficult intubation decreases or not. In order to determine the incidence of severe difficult intubation, we conducted a survey of patients who presented with severely difficult intubation during 2005-2010. Methods: From data of patients in whom tracheal intubation was attempted in the operating rooms in Hokkaido university hospital from January 2005 to December 2010, the data was collected on the patients who presented with severely difficult intubation, defined as the inability to secure tracheal intubation in less than 20 min from induction of anesthesia. Results: A total of 21,982 tracheal intubations were attempted during the study period. The incidence of severely difficult intubation was 0.3% (65 intubations for 58 patients). There was no significant difference among the years in the incidence of severely difficult intubation. Conclusions: The incidence of severely difficult intubation was 0.3% in Hokkaido university hospital during 2005-2010.",0,0
15983153,The LMA Fastrach facilitates fibreoptic intubation in oral cancer patients,"Purpose: To compare ease of endotracheal intubation with the Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway (ILMA) tracheal tube (TT; for LMA-Fastrach) and regular PVC TT (Portex) for nasotracheal fibreoptic intubation in oral cancer patients with a difficult airway. Methods: 40 patients of physical status ASA I-II with a history of previous oral cancer surgery and/or postoperative radiotherapy scheduled for oral cancer surgery were randomly allocated by sealed envelopes to undergo tracheal intubation with either the ILMA TT or a standard TT. Ease of nasal passage of the TT and ease of tracheal intubation over the fibrescope was assessed. Peak airway pressures were assessed intraoperatively and postoperatively for 12 hr. Results: The use of the ILMA TT increased the ease of nasotracheal intubation by increasing the percentage of successful tube placements at the first attempt (80%) in comparison with standard TT (35%); (P < 0.05). Peak airway pressures were found to remain low with the ILMA TT. None of the patients experienced any airway related complications. Conclusions: Use of a soft, flexible, nonkinking ILMA TT with a tapered tip design facilitates passage into the trachea over a fibreoptic bronchoscope and allows maintenance of lower airway pressures. The ILMA TT may be a useful adjunct for management of the difficult airway in oral cancer surgery.",0,0
1757384,Initiation of oral breathing in lambs in response to airway obstruction: mechanisms,"Our aim was to assess the mechanisms determining the reflex formation of an oral airway in response to nasal obstruction (NO) and tracheal obstruction (TO). In nine conscious lambs (14-37 days old) NO was effected by blockade of nasal tubes; TO was later effected by blockade of an endotracheal tube. We measured arterial O2 saturation, PO2, PCO2, and pH and the depth and duration of inspiratory efforts when mouth opening (MO) occurred. Responses were compared when NO and TO followed breathing of room air, rebreathed air, and 100% O2. After both NO and TO, MO was initiated most rapidly after lambs rebreathed air and least rapidly after they breathed 100% O2. Similar changes in blood gases and pH were measured when MO occurred after air breathing and rebreathing; however, the extent of these changes was greater during TO than during NO. After 100% O2 was breathed, MO occurred when lambs were still hyperoxic, but they were more hypercapnic and acidemic than after breathing air or rebreathed air. There were no differences, related to prebreathed gases or site of airway occlusion, in the depth of inspiratory efforts at the time of MO. We conclude that the formation of an oral airway requires a critical level of inspiratory drive in the presence of airway obstruction. After the prebreathing of different gases, differences in response latency and blood gases at the time of MO can be attributed to the attainment of this threshold level of inspiratory drive. The formation of an oral airway is facilitated by, but not dependent on, receptors in the upper airway.",0,0
11063359,Appropriateness of endotracheal tube size and insertion depth in children undergoing air medical transport,"Objectives: Guidelines for pediatric endotracheal tube (ETT) size and insertion depth are important in the helicopter EMS (HEMS) setting, where intubated patients are frequently transported by a non-physician flight crew providing protocol-based care in an environment noted for limitations in clinical airway assessment. The objectives of this study were to characterize, in a HEMS pediatric population, the frequency of compliance with guideline-recommended ETT size and insertion depth, and to test for association between guideline noncompliance and subsequent receiving hospital adjustment of ETT size or insertion depth. Design: This retrospective review analyzed 216 consecutive pediatric (age <14) scene and interfacility HEMS transports, of patients intubated before or during HEMS transport, by an urban two-helicopter HEMS service providing protocol-based care with a nurse/paramedic crew configuration. Patients were transported to one of three receiving academic pediatric referral centers. Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) criteria for ETT size and insertion depth were used to assess guideline-appropriateness of pediatric ETTs. Receiving hospital records were reviewed to determine if post-transport ETT size or lipline adjustment were associated with guideline-appropriateness of size and lipline during HEMS transport. Univariate (chi-square and Fisher's exact) and multivariate (logistic regression) statistics were used to assess and control for the following covariates: intubator group (physician, flight crew, ground EMS), transport year, sex, age, transport type (scene versus interfacility), and receiving hospital. For all analyses, statistical significance was set at the 0.05 level. Results: The initial ETT size was within 0.5 mm of guideline-recommended sizes in 178 (83.6%) of the 213 patients for whom this data were available. Inappropriate sized ETTs were nearly always (32 of 35, 91.4%) too small. Compared to initial ETTs placed by ground EMS personnel, initial ETTs placed by flight crew or physicians were more likely to be appropriate as defined by guidelines (P = .008 and .032, respectively). Receiving hospitals changed the ETT size in 18 (8.3% of 216) cases. Receiving hospital ETT size change was more likely with later transport year (P = .018) and less likely in patients over 2 years of age (P = .03); there was no significant association between receiving hospital ETT size change and intubator group (P > .22) or guideline-appropriateness of ETT size (P = 0.94). The initial ETT insertion depth was within 1 cm of the guideline-recommended lipline in 86 (43.2%) of the 199 patients for whom this data were available. Inappropriate liplines were almost always (109 of 113, 96.5%) too deep. Compared to initial ETT liplines determined by ground EMS personnel, initial liplines determined by flight crew (P = .007), but not physician (P = .47) were more likely to be appropriate as defined by guidelines. Receiving hospitals changed the ETT insertion depth in 72 (33.3% of 216) cases. Receiving hospital lipline change was more likely (P = .03) in patients older than 2 years of age, but was not associated with intubator group (P = .75) or lipline guideline-appropriateness (P = .35). Conclusions: As judged by frequently used guidelines, pediatric ETTs are often too small and commonly inserted too deep. However, this retrospective study, limited by lack of clinical correlation for ETT size and insertion depth, failed to find an association between lack of ETT size or lipline guideline compliance and subsequent ETT adjustment at receiving pediatric centers. This study's findings, which should be confirmed with prospective investigation, cast doubt upon the utility of pediatric ETT size/lipline guidelines as strict clinical or quality assurance tools for use in pediatric airway management.",0,0

602956,Post-extubation pulmonary function tests in detection of upper airway obstruction in drug-overdosed patients,"A relatively high percentage of hypnotic-sedative drug-overdosed (HSDO) patients suffer post-extubation upper airway obstruction. Since early detection and treatment of these lesions is desirable, we studied 20 recently extubated (within 24 hours) as well as 11 non-intubated HSDO patients employing flow-volume loops and spirometry. Abnormalities in tests for upper airway obstruction were common in both groups but only in the four post-extubation patients with clinically suspected upper airway obstruction was an inspiratory plateau by flow volume loops found. In addition, three of these four patients had mid-VC ratios greater than 1.25. We conclude that the Inspiratory flow volume loop and the mid-VC ratio may help in detecting post-extubation upper airway obstruction in lethargic, HSDO patients.",0,0
27066203,Comparison of the GlideScope and the McGrath method using vascular forceps and a tube exchanger in cases of simulated difficult airway intubation,"Background: A ""difficult airway"" can be simulated with an extrication collar, which restricts cervical motion and mouth opening. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of the GlideScope and the McGrath in difficult airway simulation. Methods: Patients were randomized using computer-generated numbers and were placed into the GlideScope group or the McGrath group. The total intubation time was defined as the time measured from when the anesthesiologist picks up the device to the time at which three successive end-tidal CO2 values are acquired after intubation. Results: There was no significant difference in total intubation time between the two groups (73.0 ± 25.3 sec vs. 72.3 ± 20.9 sec, P = 0.92). The success rates of the first intubation attempt did not differ between the two groups (82.8% vs. 83.3%, P = 0.95). Conclusions: Our results suggest that there are no significant differences in the intubations with GlideScope and McGrath using vascular forceps and tube exchangers in difficult intubation scenarios.",0,0
19297115,Feasibility of the preoperative Mallampati airway assessment in emergency department patients,"Background: Multiple predictors have been proposed to assist in identifying patient features that would predict difficult airway management. The Mallampati score (MS) has been shown to be useful in the preoperative assessment of patients being intubated in the operating room. Objective: We sought to define the feasibility of this assessment in the Emergency Department. Methods: A prospective, observational study was performed on all patients being intubated at a university Level I trauma center over a period of 6 months. We recorded and calculated the proportion of patients who were successfully assessed using the MS. Reasons given by individual intubators for failure to assess were recorded. We also tracked patient characteristics between groups and complication rates. Results: Of 328 patients, 32 (10%) were excluded due to incomplete data. Among the remaining 296, 58% were intubated for non-trauma indications, 70% were male, and the mean age was 45.9 years. Only 76 of 296 (26%) (95% confidence interval 21-31%) were able to have the MS performed. Lack of patient cooperation and clinical instability were listed as factors that precluded evaluation in patients whose assessment was unsuccessful. The frequency of procedure-related minor events did not differ significantly between the assessed and non-assessed groups. Major events included two cricothyrotomies in the non-assessed group. Conclusions: We were unable to perform a Mallampati assessment in three-quarters of our patients requiring emergency intubation. These findings call into question the feasibility of the standard Mallampati assessment in the practice of Emergency Medicine.",0,0
10519176,[Guidelines on difficult intubation in anesthesia: evaluation of 2 information diffusion methods],"Background: In 1996, experts from the Société Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation published guidelines about difficult intubation. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of two diffusion methods of these guidelines, media versus direct mailing plus media diffusion, and the relation between reading of the guidelines and practice behavior and training willingness. Methods: Data were collected in two different samples of 300 anesthetists from three regions for pre and post-intervention surveys (E1 and E2 samples). Half of the anesthetists from E2, randomly chosen, received a direct mailing of the guidelines (E2a sample). The remaining constituted the E2b sample. Three assessment criteria were used, two concerning practice behavior and one training willingness. Relationship between these criteria and diffusion methods and reading was tested using logistic regression. Results: The response rates were respectively 91%, 80% and 78% in the E1, E2a and E2b samples. The socio-professional features were not statistically different between the three samples. There was no relationship between the criteria and the diffusion methods. The direct mailing did not increase the reading rate (81% and 82% respectively in the E2a and E2b samples). The rate of anesthetists who routinely screened for predictive signs of difficult intubation (one of the practice criteria) was higher in E2a than in E2b (28% and 12% respectively). In the multivariate analysis, the difference only appeared among the sub-group of anesthetists who did not receive the direct mailing. The private practice was associated with a lower rate of routine screening. Conclusion: No impact of the diffusion methods on practice behavior and training willingness was found. Reading was inconstantly associated with practice behavior.",0,0
21392269,"Morphological features of elderly patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: a prospective controlled, comparative cohort study","Objectives: To investigate the pharyngeal morphologic features and its pathogenic role on obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in the elderly population. Design: Prospective controlled, comparative cohort study. Setting: Territory referral centre. Participants: We enroled 320 consecutive patients with complaints of snoring who visited Nagoya University Hospital from January 2004 to December 2007. We also collected 26 control subjects aged over 60 years from community-dwelling people. Main outcome measures: We underwent a morphological evaluation, measurement of nasal resistance, assessment of daytime sleepiness and nocturnal polysomnography. Results and conclusions: Two hundred and ninety-two patients were analysed. The constitution ratio of men, the body mass index and Epworth sleepiness scale were decreased with ageing. Tonsil size was reduced progressively with ageing. Retroglossal space was wider, and soft palate was lower in ≥ 60 year group than in < 40 year group. Retroglossal space was wide in elderly patients with sleep apnoea compared with control subjects. Tonsil size was not correlated to apnoea/hypopnoea index in ≥ 60 year group unlike the other generations. Modified Mallampati Score and tongue size were significantly but mildly correlated only in ≥ 60 year group. Width of fauces was correlated in all the groups. Multiple regression analysis showed that body mass index, age, gender, tonsil size and width of fauces were independent factors for apnoea/hypopnoea index. Conclusions: Morphologically, the tonsil could play a minor role but the width of fauces could play relatively a major role. Additionally, wide retroglossal space, low positional soft palate and large tongue size may be characteristics for elderly patients of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.",0,0

23468025,Oxygen supplementation during awake fibreoptic bronchoscopy in a Nigerian tertiary hospital,"Background: Examination of the airway is necessary in a wide variety of conditions. This study was carried out to determine the need for oxygen supplementation during the conduct of flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy on the awake patient. Study design: A prospective study of consecutive consenting patients requiring awake flexible bronchoscopy between January 2010 and December 2011 using a fibreoptic bronchoscope in the study centre was conducted. With the aid of transcutaneous pulse oximetry, baseline oxygen saturation values were recorded as well as at the various stages of the procedure as well as during brush cytology, washings, biopsy, transbronchial biopsies and transbronchial needle aspirations and 5, 15 and 30 minutes post-procedure. Data was analysed using SPSS 16 and significant values were taken at pd""0.05. Results: Sixty-seven awake fibreoptic bronchoscopies were performed on 61 patients comprising 38 males and 29 females and a mean age of 51.9 ± 18.9 years. The lowest mean SPO2 of 91.2% was attained during brush cytology. Thirty- four patients (50.7%) had the procedure without oxygen supplementation. Supplemental oxygen was required in all seven patients with a baseline SPO2 of d""92% while it was required in 63.2% of patients with baseline SPO2 of 93- 96%. Baseline oxygen saturation was the most important predictor of the need for oxygen supplementation (p= 0.005). Conclusion: Routine oxygen supplementation is not mandatory for the safe conduct of flexible bronchoscopy. The baseline oxygen saturation value accurately predicts the need for oxygen administration.",0,0
24633945,Effect of mandibular tori on glottic exposure during simulated suspension microlaryngoscopy,"Objectives: Mandibular tori have been identified as a contributing factor in difficult exposure during intubation. However, no investigation has measured the effect of mandibular tori on glottic exposure during suspension microlaryngoscopy (SML). The objective of this study was to measure how the size and location of mandibular tori affect glottic exposure during simulated SML at different thyromental distances. Methods: Suspension microlaryngoscopy was modeled on an anatomically accurate skull and larynx with thyromental distances between 6 and 12 cm. Mandibular tori were simulated by protruding screws 5 to 15 mm from the lingual aspect of the mandible. The tori were positioned either 15 mm (anterior) or 25 mm (posterior) from the midline of the symphysis. The glottic exposure for the various-size tori in each location was measured by recording the displacement of the glottiscope tip relative to the most anterior exposure achievable without tori. The glottiscope angle relative to the horizontal plane was measured for each condition. Results: Mandibular tori of more than 10 mm had a significant impact on glottic exposure. Displacement of the glottiscope tip ranged from 2 to 9 mm for anteriorly placed tori and from 7 to 29 mm for posteriorly placed tori, with larger tori causing greater displacement. Increasing the thyromental distance increased the posterior glottiscope tip displacement regardless of torus size or location. The glottiscope angle increased with larger tori (12º to 28º), but this angle did not change with increasing thyromental distance. Conclusions: Larger size and more-posterior location of mandibular tori more significantly reduce glottic exposure during SML. The inner table of the mandible is the most relevant anatomic constraint on glottic exposure, which varies with the presence or absence of mandibular tori independent of thyromental distance.",0,0
6824989,Low thoracic epidural anaesthesia for elective cholecystectomy in a patient with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension,"A 52-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension secondary to partial anomalous pulmonary venous return unassociated with atrial septal defect was given thoracic epidural anaesthesia for elective cholecystectomy. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by increased pulmonary blood flow which in severe cases results in pulmonary hypertension subjecting the right ventricle to strain. An epidural catheter was placed at the T11-T12 interspace and anaesthesia was established to the T4 dermatomal level with bupivacaine (180 mg) and lidocaine (100 mg). Central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, radial artery pressure, and cardiac output were monitored. There was minimal change in pulmonary arterial pressure, although there was a significant drop in systemic arterial pressure. Thoracic epidural block is recommended for upper abdominal surgery in clinical situations with pulmonary hypertension.",0,0
25325606,Does neck-to-waist ratio predict obstructive sleep apnea in children?,"Objectives: Central adiposity and large neck circumference are associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults but have not been evaluated in children as predictors of OSA. Study objectives were to determine whether (1) anthropometric measures including neck-to-waist ratio are associated with OSA in older children; (2) body fat distribution, measured by neck-to-waist ratio, is predictive of OSA in overweight/obese children. Methods: Cross-sectional study involving children 7-18 years scheduled to undergo polysomnography at a tertiary care children's hospital. OSA was defined as total apnea-hypopnea index > 5 events/h and/or obstructive apnea index > 1 event/h. Recursive partitioning was used to select candidate predictors of OSA from: age, sex, height and weight percentile, body mass index (BMI) z-score, neck-to-waist ratio, tonsil size, and Mallampati score. These were then evaluated using log binomial models and receiver operator characteristic analysis. Results: Two hundred twenty-two participants were included; 133 (60%) were overweight/obese, 121 (55%) male,47 (21%) had OSA. Neck-to-waist ratio (relative risk [RR] 1.97 per 0.1 units, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.84) and BMI z-score (RR 1.63 per unit, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.05) were identified as independent predictors of OSA. Considering only overweight/obese children, neck-to-waist ratio (RR 2.16 per 0.1 units, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.59) and BMI z-score (RR 2.02 per unit, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.26) also independently predicted OSA. However, in children not overweight/obese, these variables were not predictive of OSA. Conclusions: Neck-to-waist ratio, an index of body fat distribution, predicts OSA in older children and youth, especially in those who were overweight/obese.",0,0
25668307,Waist circumference and postmenopause stages as the main associated factors for sleep apnea in women: a cross-sectional population-based study,"Objective: The current study aimed to investigate stages of reproductive aging as an associated factor for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) among women in a representative sample of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Four hundred seven women underwent clinical evaluation, polysomnography, and biochemical analysis. Stages of reproductive aging were defined as premenopause, early postmenopause, and late postmenopause. Results: OSAS was more frequent in the postmenopausal groups, with 68.4% of women affected by severe OSAS belonging to the late postmenopause group. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, associated factors for OSAS, regardless of its severity, were waist circumference, modified Mallampati score IV, and both postmenopause stages. For moderate to severe OSAS and severe OSAS, we found waist circumference and both postmenopause stages to be the main factors. We carried out a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, which demonstrated that the cutoff value for waist circumference was 87.5 cm, with a maximum of 75.7% accuracy for the classification of women as OSAS or non-OSAS. Conclusions: OSAS is prevalent in postmenopausal women, especially in late postmenopause. This study highlights the association between waist circumference, early postmenopause and late postmenopause, and severity of OSAS. Our findings suggest that postmenopause stages may potentially exacerbate the presence of sleep disturbance and that reducing waist circumference may be an important strategy for managing OSAS in women.",0,0
16032630,Use of gum elastic bougie for prehospital difficult intubation,"The objective of this study was to assess effectiveness of gum elastic bougie (GEB) in case of difficult intubation occurring in the prehospital settings. After manikin training to GEB handling, physicians were recommended to use GEB as first alternative technique in case of difficult intubation. Intubating conditions and details of patients requiring GEB-assisted laryngoscopy were recorded over 30 months. Among the 1442 extrahospital intubations performed, 41 patients (3%) required GEB. Gum elastic bougie allowed successful intubation in 33 cases (78%) and 8 patients sustained a second alternative technique. One patient was never intubated, another 1 required rescue cricothyroidotomy. Twenty-four (60%) GEB patients had associated factors for difficult intubation such as reduced or limited cervical spine mobility, morbid obesity, cervicofacial trauma, and ears, nose, and throat neoplasia. The success rate of GEB was 75% and 94%, respectively, depending on whether associated factors for difficult intubation are present or not. No adverse events associated to GEB use were noted.",0,0
16490092,The clinical observation of difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation in infants with cleft lip and palate,"Background: The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy in infants with cleft lip and palate and to observe its relationships with age, sites, and degrees of deformities. Methods: A total of 985 infants aged 1 month to 3 years, undergoing repair of cleft lip and palate were included in this study. The infants suffering from unilateral cleft lip, simple cleft palate, and combined bilateral cleft lip and palate were 465, 421, and 79 respectively. They were divided into three groups according to age; 1-6 months group, 6-12 months group and 1-3 years group. Results: The total incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was 4.77%. The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was closely related to age, sites and degrees of deformities, and micrognathia. The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was 7.06% in 1-6 months group, 2.90% in 6-12 months group, and 3.13% in 1-3 years group, and was greatest for infants with combined bilateral cleft lip and palate, less for those with left cleft lip and least for those with right cleft lip and simple cleft palate. The incidences of difficult laryngoscopy in infants with and without micrognathia were 50% and 3.83% respectively. The incidences of moderately difficult, difficult, and failed intubations were 1.02%, 0.91%, and 0.102% respectively. Conclusions: Infants with cleft lip and palate, left cleft lip and alveolus, combined bilateral cleft lip and palate, micrognathia, and age <6 months were the important risk factors for difficult laryngoscopy. Difficult intubation occurred mainly in infants with laryngoscopic views of grade III and IV.",0,0
10145480,Testing airway management skills: interactive video courseware vs ACLS instructor,"Lectures and demonstrations have been the teaching and testing strategies most often employed by the American Heart Association in Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) training. I compared the abilities of interactive videodisc (IVD) courseware and ACLS instructors to evaluate airway management skills. Methods & materials: Twenty-two subjects were simultaneously tested during 30 attempts at endotracheal (ET) intubation and 34 attempts at esophageal obturator airway or esophageal gastric tube airway (EOA/EGTA) insertion. The instructors were blind to the visual and auditory messages produced. Results: The IVD program and the ACLS instructors showed high agreement in their evaluation of student performance for time of intubation (95.5% ET; 100% EOA/EGTA), proper tube placement (91% ET; 93% EOA/EGTA), appropriate tube assessment (95.5% ET; 100% EOA/EGTA), and correct EOA/EGTA cuff inflation (100%). Lower levels of agreement were noted with ET and EOA/EGTA appropriate head positioning, and the evaluation of tooth pressure with ET intubation (60.5%, 76.5%, and 66.0%, respectively). The IVD system was unable to detect certain procedural errors associated with appropriate intubation procedure--syringe attachment, syringe removal after cuff inflation, and control of tube after intubation. The low agreement for tooth pressure suggests that the sensor-equipped manikin may better evaluate tooth pressure than does the observer. Conclusions: Although the IVD system shows promise as an adjunct method for instruction and testing, it cannot be considered suitable for 'stand-alone' instruction. Further research is needed to explore costs, skills retention, and possible impact of the medium for training hospital and prehospital-care personnel.",0,0
23479917,"[A case of an unexpected difficult nasal intubation, caused by hypertrophied lingual tonsil]","We experienced a case of unexpected difficult nasal intubation due to lingual tonsil hyperplasia. A 43-year-old man was scheduled for pharyngoplasty because of sleep apnea syndrome. After induction of general anesthesia, Macintosh laryngoscopy failed to expose his glottis by two experienced anesthesiologists. We also found that the view of his larynx by fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was poor, and nasal intubation guided by FOB was difficult. Finally, we made an oral intubation with Macintosh laryngoscopy under a gum elastic bougie guide. Ventilation and oxygenation were maintained throughout the procedure. A FOB guided intubation under general anesthesia is often difficult, because identification of glottis is interfered by deviated pharyngeal tissue and epiglottis, which are affected by the use of muscle relaxants. At present, a selective relaxant binding agent, sugammadex, is available in anesthesia, to reverse the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant and to restore spontaneous breathing in this situation.",0,0
10084001,Awake tracheal intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask,"Purpose: To report successful awake insertion of the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach) and subsequent tracheal intubation through it, in a patient with predicted difficult tracheal intubation, due to limited mouth opening, and difficult ventilation through a facemask, due to a large mass at the corner of the mouth. Clinical features: A 53-yr-old woman with a large post-gangrenous mass on the right cheek to the angle of the mouth was scheduled for its resection. The right side of her face was damaged by a bomb attack followed by cancrum oris 50 yr ago. The distance between the incisors during maximum mouth opening was 2 cm and that between the gums on the right side < 1 cm. After preoxygenation and 50 micrograms fentanyl and 30 mg propofol i.v., propofol was infused at 2 mg.kg-1.hr-1. Lidocaine, 8%, was sprayed on the oropharynx. A #4 intubating laryngeal mask was inserted with a little difficulty. A fibrescope was passed through a 7.5-mm ID RAE tracheal tube, and the combination was easily passed through the laryngeal mask into the trachea. General ansthesia was then induced. Finally, the intubating laryngeal mask was removed, while the RAE tube was being stabilized using an uncuffed 6.0-mm ID tracheal tube. Conclusion: Awake tracheal intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask is a useful technique in patients with limited mouth opening in whom ventilation via a facemask is expected to be difficult.",0,0

19461561,Preauricular skin tags and difficult tracheal intubation: a case report,"Despite the large variety of equipment available for pediatric intubations, difficult tracheal intubation is still a main factor in deaths associated with anesthesia, especially in children with congenital anomalies of the airways or with rare diseases and syndromes. The aim of this study was to focus attention on the possibility of difficult intubation in children with preauricular tags. This condition is reported as both isolated and associated with more complex syndromes, including nephrourological anomalies and multiple craniofacial dysmorphysms. We retrospectively analyzed the anesthesia procedures for seven children (aged between 3 and 18 months) who underwent surgical ablation of preauricular tags between October 2006 and April 2008 at the Fondazione Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Mangiagalli and Regina Elena of Milan. Two of these children, both native residents of Sri Lanka, presented with a problematic airway and difficult tracheal intubation, which was suspected in one case but totally unexpected in the other. Considering the International Guidelines for difficult intubation in pediatrics and the data of other authors, our conclusions for how to approach a child with preauricular tags are: 1) to verify whether the defect is isolated or associated with other malformations; 2) to analyze the medical history and to perform an accurate physical examination to identify a possibly difficult airway; and 3) to not exceed three attempts to intubate and, if possible, to choose an alternative strategy.",0,0

26673904,Anatomic and physiopathologic changes affecting the airway of the elderly patient: implications for geriatric-focused airway management,"There are many anatomical, physiopathological, and cognitive changes that occur in the elderly that affect different components of airway management: intubation, ventilation, oxygenation, and risk of aspiration. Anatomical changes occur in different areas of the airway from the oral cavity to the larynx. Common changes to the airway include tooth decay, oropharyngeal tumors, and significant decreases in neck range of motion. These changes may make intubation challenging by making it difficult to visualize the vocal cords and/or place the endotracheal tube. Also, some of these changes, including but not limited to, atrophy of the muscles around the lips and an edentulous mouth, affect bag mask ventilation due to a difficult face-mask seal. Physiopathologic changes may impact airway management as well. Common pulmonary issues in the elderly (eg, obstructive sleep apnea and COPD) increase the risk of an oxygen desaturation event, while gastrointestinal issues (eg, achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease) increase the risk of aspiration. Finally, cognitive changes (eg, dementia) not often seen as related to airway management may affect patient cooperation, especially if an awake intubation is required. Overall, degradation of the airway along with other physiopathologic and cognitive changes makes the elderly population more prone to complications related to airway management. When deciding which airway devices and techniques to use for intubation, the clinician should also consider the difficulty associated with ventilating the patient, the patient's risk of oxygen desaturation, and/or aspiration. For patients who may be difficult to bag mask ventilate or who have a risk of aspiration, a specialized supralaryngeal device may be preferable over bag mask for ventilation. Patients with tumors or decreased neck range of motion may require a device with more finesse and maneuverability, such as a flexible fiberoptic broncho-scope. Overall, geriatric-focused airway management is necessary to decrease complications in this patient population.",0,0
22969214,"""Passive-bending colonoscope"" significantly improves cecal intubation in difficult cases","Colonoscopy sometimes causes pain during insertion, especially in difficult cases. Over-insufflation of air causes elongation or acute angulations of the colon, making passage of the scope difficult and causing pain. We previously reported a sedative-risk-free colonoscopy insertion technique, namely, ""Water Navigation Colonoscopy"". Complete air suction after water infusion not only improves the vision, but also makes water flow down to the descending colon, while the sigmoid colon collapses and shortens. While non-sedative colonoscopy can be carried out without pain in most cases, some patients do complain of pain. Most of these patients have abnormal colon morphology, and the pain is caused while negotiating the ""hairpin"" bends of the colon. The ""hairpin"" bends of the colon should be negotiated by gently pushing the full-angled colonoscope. The proximal 10-20 cm from the angulated part of the conventional colonoscope is stiff, with a wide turning radius, therefore, a conventional colonoscope cannot be negotiated through the ""hairpin"" bends of the colon without stretching them and causing pain. The ""passive-bending colonoscope"" has a flexible tip with a narrow turning radius, so that the scope can be negotiated through the ""hairpin"" bends of the colon with a minimum turning radius and minimal discomfort. Therefore, the intubation and pain-reducing performance of the ""passive-bending colonoscope"" was assessed in difficult cases.",0,0
19019463,Stridor due to a bridge-like subglottic stenosis in a 10-week-old male infant,We present an infant with post-intubation stridor caused by a bridge-like subglottic stenosis. At the age of 6 weeks he suffered from a RSV infection with the need for endotracheal intubation. At week 10 acute respiratory distress required a re-intubation. Flexible endoscopy was suggestive for laryngomalacia. Rigid endoscopy revealed a subglottic laterolateral mucosal bridge resulting in a doubling of the airway lumen. Histopathological examination showed a fibrinoid pseudomembrane. Follow up endoscopy showed a grade 1 posterior subglottic stenosis without respiratory compromise. This is the first case in the literature of an infant with a post-intubation bridge-like fibrinoid pseudomembranous subglottic lesion.,0,0
8765864,[Anesthesiologic problems in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva],"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare, congenital disease of the striated muscular system, ligaments and fascia; it leads to complete ossification in adult life. The disease usually begins in the first decade of life and is accompanied by abnormalities of the hands and feet that have already begun to occur at birth. There is no effective therapy. Although some of these patients have to undergo an operation, there is very little information available on anaesthetic procedures. CASE REPORT. A 49-year-old-woman came to the anaesthetic ward for amputation of her left foot with the diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP) and an infection resistant to any antibiotic treatment. Except for her left elbow, she could not move any of her extremities. Her back and neck were stiff (Figs. 1, 2), she could not open her mouth more than 2.5 cm, and her teeth were full of cavities and loose (Fig. 3). Aspiration of gastric content some time ago was known. Lung function showed a restrictive pattern. She suffered from kyphoscoliosis and needed chronic nasal administration of O2. With this therapy the arterial blood gas analysis was normal. Right bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram was found. She was in a wheelchair and was completely dependent on the help of others. She was taking no medicine at the time of admission. A second operation was necessary because of reactive bone proliferation with a danger of skin perforation. DISCUSSION. This rare and congenital disease was first described in 1648 by G. Patin [14] and again in 1736 by J. Freke [10]. Since then, the progressive ossification of striated muscles, ligaments and facia has been described more than 600 times. Despite this fact, descriptions of anaesthetic procedures are rare. Because of the neck stiffness, the small mouth opening, the poor teeth and the recently observed history of aspiration, fiberoptic nasal intubation when the patient is awake was found to be the best choice. The possibility of atlanto-axial subluxation in such cases [2, 4] favored this procedure. Other authors have used blind nasal intubation [11], ketamine without intubation [18], or even local anaesthesia for a cesarean section [21]. Newer publications [13, 20] promote fiberoptic intubation and general anaesthesia with or without muscle relaxation. In this case propofol/fentanyl/ N2O/O2 without muscle relaxation was used for the first operation and etomidate/fentanyl/ethran/ N2O/O2 without muscle relaxation for the second procedure. During both anaesthesias important hypotension with good response to a generous volume supply was seen. The patient recovered well. Unfortunately, she died a few weeks later from suicide. The goal of this case report is to emphasize the value of the fibrobronchoscope in patients with FOP.",0,0
10916007,[Air trapping revealing endobronchial tuberculosis],"We report a case of endobronchial tuberculosis located in the main left bronchus suspected on a CT scan and assessed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. This localisation is not unusual, and is often associated with a normal chest radiography. Air trapping present on high resolution CT scan led to focus the examination on proximal airways and to suspect their involvement. This observation underlines the value of expiratory CT scan in demonstrating proximal stenosis of main bronchi.",0,0
22420397,Can we predict a difficult intubation in cleft lip/palate patients?,"Objective: To find predictors of a difficult intubation in infants with an isolated or a syndromic cleft lip/palate. Study design: Retrospective review: single-blind trial. Settings: Tertiary care centre. Methods: A total of 145 infants born with cleft lip/palate were enrolled. Three clinical and seven lip/palate anatomic parameters were evaluated. The grade of intubation was determined by the anesthesiologist at the time of the labioplasty/staphylorrhaphy surgery at 3 and 10 months, respectively. Main outcome measure: Intubation grade. Results: The relative risk of a difficult intubation in the cleft lip, cleft palate without the Pierre Robin sequence, cleft lip-palate, and cleft palate with Pierre Robin sequence groups was 0, 2.7, 10, and 23%, respectively. The infants born with the Pierre Robin sequence had a statistically significant higher intubation grade. The degree of difficulty was increased in cases with early airway and feeding problems (p < .0001). Within the group of cleft palate patients without any lip malformation, a wider cleft was associated with a higher intubation grade with statistical significance (p = .0323). Conclusions: Infants born with Pierre Robin sequence have a statistically significantly higher risk of difficult intubation. Within this group, of all the studied factors, a clinical history of early airway and feeding problems was the best predictor of a difficult endotracheal intubation. In cleft palate patients without any cleft lip, larger width of the cleft is also a significant predictor.",0,0
10958231,Induced sputum: diagnostic value in interstitial lung disease,"Induced sputum by inhalation of hypertonic saline solution is a noninvasive technique used to collect cellular and soluble material from lung airways. During the past decade, this method has been widely used to assess airway inflammation in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, since it produces reliable results and compares favorably to other invasive techniques, such as biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Induced sputum has been recently used to study interstitial lung disease (ILD), more specifically pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis, and nongranulomatous ILD. Moreover, results from induced sputum supplied information comparable to BAL findings for occupational lung disease and were able to distinguish sarcoidosis patients from healthy subjects and from patients with nongranulomatous ILD. Although induced sputum had previously provided promising results in assessing patients with ILD, its diagnostic role has not yet been well defined. Further studies of the evaluation by induced sputum of grading of severity, follow-up of disease, and effects of treatment are needed. Additionally, to date no specific studies have been undertaken to evaluate the safety and functional effects of sputum induction on patients with ILD. In conclusion, we think that induced sputum can be used as a complementary tool to BAL both in research and in clinical monitoring of patients with ILD.",0,0
1977068,Oral complications associated with endotracheal general anesthesia,"A series of 745 consecutive cases of endotracheal anesthesia were collected at the National Taiwan University Hospital. Evaluation of the oral conditions was performed before, during and after the anesthesia. Injuries to oral structures were recorded. An 18% incidence of oral injuries was noted and the frequency for dental damage was 12.1%. Maxillary incisors, especially the left ones, were accident-prone. Risk factors identified in this study included large decay or restoration, advanced periodontitis, presence of dental prosthesis, shedding deciduous tooth, class II jaw relationship and anterior crowding. More than one third of the complications occurred during the maintenance or emergence stage of the anesthesia. Recommendations for prevention and management of this problem were given.",0,0

Positioning, sealing, patient comfort and airway morbidity]","Background: Supraglottic airway devices (SGAD) have become more important in airway management over the past years and an objective comparison of the available devices is in order. Methods: In a prospective study the four SGADs LMA-Classic(cLMA), LMA-ProSeal (PLMA), Ambu AuraOnce and Intersurgical i-gel were compared in groups of 40 patients in ambulatory surgery, with respect to the feasibility of positioning, leak tightness, patient comfort and airway morbidity. The seal test of the airway devices was carried out with a specially constructed pneumotachograph. Results: Adequate placement on the first attempt was achieved in 92.5% with the cLMA, 85% with the PLMA, 92.5% with the AuraOnce and 82.5% with the i-gel (p>0.05). There were no clinically relevant differences in mean insertion times: cLMA 13.8 s (+/-3.4 s), PLMA 13 s (+/-3.2 s), AuraOnce 11.2 s (+/-2.7 s; p<0.05) and 13.9 s (+/-3.6 s) with the i-gel. A tight seal at a constant oropharyngeal pressure of 15 cmH(2)O was achieved in 85% of the cases (34 cases) with the cLMA, 90% (36 cases) with the PLMA, 97.5% (39 cases) with the AuraOnce and 72.5% (29 cases) with the i-gel (p<0.05). A tight seal at a constant oropharyngeal pressure of 20 cmH(2)O was seen in 62.5% with the cLMA, 60% with the PLMA, 67.5% with the AuraOnce and in 50% with the i-gel of the cases (p>0.05). Airway morbidity was not observed in any group. Significantly more patients complained of a sore throat after using the cLMA (p<0.05). Conclusion: The tested SGADs were comparable with regard to ease of insertion, insertion times and airway morbidity. Considering leak tightness and patient comfort the PLMA and the AuraOnce fared better with regard to tightness of seal and patient comfort.",0,0
21451975,Using temporomandibular joint mobility to predict difficult tracheal intubation,"The aim of this prospective study was to determine the reliability of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) mobility measurements for predicting difficult intubation. To evaluate the accuracy in predicting difficult intubation by TMJ mobility measurement, 762 patients requiring general anesthesia with tracheal intubation for elective surgery were enrolled in this prospective, observational, single-blind study. Maximum mouth opening, right-left jaw excursion, and degrees of protraction were determined with a digital inclinometer. Incisor gap was measured using a vernier caliper during full mouth opening. After induction of anesthesia using a standard protocol, the patient's grade of laryngeal view by Cormack-Lehane classification was documented by an anesthesiologist. We found that the degrees of protraction and incisor gap in the easy intubation group were significantly higher than those in the difficult intubation group. The incisor gap was found to be more sensitive (88.37%) and more specific (95.71%) than protraction degrees (58.14% and 59.76%, respectively). The results revealed that measurements of the incisor gap and degrees of protraction may be useful routine screening tests for preoperative prediction of difficult intubation.",1,1
22151802,Observational study on efficacy of negative expiratory pressure test proposed as screening for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among commercial interstate bus drivers--protocol study,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a respiratory disease characterized by the collapse of the extrathoracic airway and has important social implications related to accidents and cardiovascular risk. The main objective of the present study was to investigate whether the drop in expiratory flow and the volume expired in 0.2 s during the application of negative expiratory pressure (NEP) are associated with the presence and severity of OSA in a population of professional interstate bus drivers who travel medium and long distances. Methods/design: An observational, analytic study will be carried out involving adult male subjects of an interstate bus company. Those who agree to participate will undergo a detailed patient history, physical examination involving determination of blood pressure, anthropometric data, circumference measurements (hips, waist and neck), tonsils and Mallampati index. Moreover, specific questionnaires addressing sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness will be administered. Data acquisition will be completely anonymous. Following the medical examination, the participants will perform a spirometry, NEP test and standard overnight polysomnography. The NEP test is performed through the administration of negative pressure at the mouth during expiration. This is a practical test performed while awake and requires little cooperation from the subject. In the absence of expiratory flow limitation, the increase in the pressure gradient between the alveoli and open upper airway caused by NEP results in an increase in expiratory flow. Discussion: Despite the abundance of scientific evidence, OSA is still underdiagnosed in the general population. In addition, diagnostic procedures are expensive, and predictive criteria are still unsatisfactory. Because increased upper airway collapsibility is one of the main determinants of OSA, the response to the application of NEP could be a predictor of this disorder. With the enrollment of this study protocol, the expectation is to encounter predictive NEP values for different degrees of OSA in order to contribute toward an early diagnosis of this condition and reduce its impact and complications among commercial interstate bus drivers.

26790337,[Comparison of Tracheal Intubation Performance between Macintosh Direct Laryngoscope and McGRATH® MAC Video Laryngoscope among Anesthesia Trainees],"Background: From April 2013, Macintosh direct laryngoscopes (DL) were replaced by McGRATH® MAC video laryngoscopes (VL), and VL were distributed in all of our operating rooms and used as routine first choice devices. Purpose of this study was to compare the success rate of the first attempt tracheal intubation by the trainees with VL and DL. Incidence of tracheal intubation related injuries were also assessed. Materials and methods: We reviewed anesthesia chart database in which tracheal intubations were provided by anesthesia trainees with experience of less than 3 months. Patient demographics, Mallampati classification and tracheal intubation profiles including type of the tracheal tube and devices were recorded. Results and discussion: The first attempt success rate was 78.6% with DL and 92.8% with VL (P < 0.001). More than 2 repeated trial incidence was 5.2% with DL and 1.3% with VL (P < 0.001). Incidence of mucosal injury was lower with DL than VL. Conclusions: VL notably improved the first success rate of tracheal intubation compared with DL among trainees.",0,0
17456674,"Cricoid pressure impedes insertion of, and ventilation through, the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway in anesthetized, paralyzed patients","Background: We designed this prospective self-controlled study to assess whether cricoid pressure hampers placement of and ventilation through the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (ProSeal LMA) in anesthetized, paralyzed adult patients. Methods: After induction of anesthesia, the ProSeal LMA was inserted using the introducer tool with cricoid pressure advanced as far as possible, and the cuff pressure was set at 60 cm H2O. Ventilation adequacy and anatomic position were scored using measures previously described for ProSeal LMA assessment. Airway seal pressure was recorded. Cricoid pressure was then released, the ProSeal LMA further advanced and reseated, and the assessment repeated. Results: Lung ventilation scores, anatomic position scores, and airway seal pressure were significantly better after release of cricoid pressure and reseating of the ProSeal LMA than in the first position, where the ProSeal LMA was seated with cricoid pressure (P < 0.05). Expiratory tidal volume during intermittent positive pressure ventilation was similar with and without cricoid pressure, but peak inspiratory pressure decreased from 28 cm H(2)O with cricoid pressure to 14 cm H(2)O without cricoid pressure (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Cricoid pressure applied before insertion hampered proper placement of the ProSeal LMA. Temporary cricoid pressure release during insertion allowed the device to be advanced to the proper position. After correct placement of the ProSeal LMA, application of cricoid pressure did not change tidal volume, but produced a significant increase in peak inspiratory pressure.",0,0
11771613,Unexpected difficult intubation in a patient with normal airway on assessment,Routine preoperative assessment of the patient's airway includes an assessment of mouth opening and a grading of the view according to the Mallampati scale.

22646973,Prospective model-based comparison of different laryngoscopes for difficult intubation in infants,"Background: Difficult intubation in infants is uncommon but may be a challenge for the anesthesiologist. Many optical-assisted techniques are available to ease endotracheal placement of tube but have not been systemically evaluated for pediatric practice. Aim: The study was performed to compare conventional pediatric Macintosh - with different optical laryngoscopes in difficult endotracheal intubation in infants. We hypothesized that inexperienced anesthetists would perform more successful with optical devices and that differences between the devices would be found. Methods/materials: In this randomized controlled study, 30 anesthesia residents performed endotracheal intubation in an infant model of difficult airway presenting with airway obstruction and neck immobilization. Primary endpoints were intubation success rate and intubation time. Beyond that glottis view, dental trauma and difficulty of technique were evaluated and measured by a study observer. Macintosh, Airtraq(®), Storz DCI(®) -, and Gyrus Infant Bullard(®) laryngoscopes were used in random order. After standardized briefing every resident had three attempts of at most 120 s with every device to place a 3-mm tube into the trachea. Glottis view and difficulty of technique were rated by the residents using classification of Cormack/Lehane and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 0 = easy to 10 = very difficult). Results: Success rate was 41% with conventional Macintosh, 43% with Airtraq(®), 62% with Storz DCI(®), and 100% with Bullard(®) laryngoscopes. Median time from passing the lips to first ventilation was 67 s (Storz DCI(®) laryngoscope), 54 s (Macintosh laryngoscope), 45 s (Airtraq(®) laryngoscope), and 21 s (Bullard(®) laryngoscope), respectively. Dental trauma did not occur with Bullard(®) laryngoscope and was frequent with Storz DCI(®) laryngoscope (39%) and Macintosh laryngoscope (42%). Glottis view was best with Bullard(®) laryngoscope (Grade 1 in 100%) and worst with Macintosh laryngoscope (Grade 1 in 2%). Difficulty of technique was rated with a VAS score of 2 (Bullard(®) laryngoscope), 4.5 (Storz DCI(®) laryngoscope) and 6 (Airtraq(®) - and Macintosh laryngoscopes). Conclusions: Inexperienced anesthetists have higher success rates and shorter intubation times with optical-assisted laryngoscopes compared with conventional Macintosh laryngoscope. Gyrus Infant Bullard(®) laryngoscope significantly undertakes best success rate and shortest intubation time with mildest impact to maxillary dents and easiest technique. Our findings support the hypothesis that optical laryngoscopes can be used successfully by inexperienced anesthetists in simulated difficult pediatric airway conditions.",0,0
9121854,Quantitative assessment of intrathoracic airway collapse in infants and children with tracheobronchomalacia,"Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is increasingly recognized in infants, children, and adults with acquired chronic lung diseases as the use of flexible bronchoscopy has become widely established in spontaneously breathing patients. However, the lack of a reliable method to quantify the severity of the airway collapse has made serial studies, evaluation of therapies, and comparisons between patients difficult. The purpose of this study was to describe a method of quantifying airway collapse in TBM. The degree of airway collapse was quantitated by measuring the ratio of the smallest to the largest airway area during a respiratory cycle. The videotape of flexible bronchoscopy was run through a video monitor and frozen at the appropriate times. The airway circumference was then traced onto plastic overlays and the area measured. The videotapes of seven infants and children with TBM and eight with normal airways were reviewed by investigators who did not know the diagnosis. Intra-observer variability was 2.2%, and inter-observer variability was 1.4%. The mean smallest/largest airway ratio was 0.34 + or - 0.14 (SD) in the subjects with known TBM, compared with a ratio of 0.82 + or - 0.08 (SD) in children with a normal airway (P< 0.0001). The range in the children with TBM was 0.22-0.61, whereas for the control children it was 0.73-0.93. In this series, there was no overlap in the ratios between affected and unaffected patients. In addition to the manual method of calculating airway area ratios, a computer-assisted method is described that could be adapted to real-time use. This way of analyzing the degree of airway collapse could be used to assess patients with TBM quantitatively and reproducibly.",0,0
11330217,A new cut-off point of thyromental distance for prediction of difficult airway,"Background: Difficult intubation, often unexpected, remains a primary concern for the anesthesiologist. None of the bedside tests have proven to be efficacious and highly predictive. The prupose of this study was to correlate the full range of thyromental distance with both the Cormack grade and the Mallampati score. Methods: One hundred and sixty patients undergoing general anesthesia were included in the study. Patients with abnormal atlanto-occipital extension, small chin size and mouth opening were excluded from the study. The thyromental distance, the Mallampati score, and the Cormack grade were determined in all patients. The correlation between the thyromental distance and each of the Cormack grade and the Mallampati score was determined, as well as the correlation between the Mallampati score and the Cormack grade. The cut-off value of the tyromental distance that discriminated best between patients with easy glottic visualization (Cormack grade 1,2) vs. difficult visualization (Cormack grade 3,4) was derived. Results: A significant and high correlation was observed between the thyromental distance and the Cormack grade (r = -0.72). In contrast, a lower correlation was observed between the thyromental distance and the Mallampati score (r = -0.41) and the Mallampati score and the Cormack grade (r = 0.47). A cut-off value for the TMD of 4 cm was the best in discriminating between patients with difficult and easy glottic visualization. The combination of TMD < or = 4 cm and Mallampati score of 3,4 predicted the patients with the most difficult glottic visualization. Conclusion: Patients with a thyromental distance greater than 4 cm can be easily intubated. In contrast, when the TMD < or = 4 cm, tracheal intubation is difficult in 48% of patients if the Mallampati score is 1,2 and in 79% if the Mallampati score is 3 or 4.",0,0
22522652,Transnasal tracheoscopy,"Objectives/hypothesis: Unsedated transnasal tracheoscopy (TNT) has emerged as a technique in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery for an awake airway examination in the office setting. This study investigates the safety, procedural success rate, indications, and findings of TNTs performed over a 3-year period at an academic medical center. Study design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: After institutional review board approval, billing records were reviewed for patients who underwent TNT from 2007-2009 in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Hospital charts for these patients were obtained, and data regarding patient demographics, complications, procedural success rate, indications, and findings were recorded. Results: Sixty-eight TNTs were performed on 44 patients over the last 3 years (25 males, 19 females; age range, 16-91 years). No complications were noted. Ninety-one percent of procedures were able to be completed. Indications for TNT were to: 1) detect airway stenosis or pathology, 2) evaluate the larynx and trachea prior to airway surgery, 3) monitor postoperative results of airway interventions, and 4) evaluate the airway prior to tracheotomy tube decannulation. Conclusions: TNT is a safe procedure that can be performed on the unsedated patient using only topical anesthesia and is an attractive alternative to rigid bronchoscopy. The procedural success rate was high, indicating good patient tolerance. The indications for TNT, including its use as a tool for surgical planning, have become better defined. TNT has become a standard tool in the management of patients with airway pathology in our practices.",0,0
10961056,[Laryngeal mask vs tracheal tube in pediatric anesthesia in the presence of upper respiratory tract infection],"Background: The aim of this report is to assess the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications in patients recently suffering from inflammation of the upper respiratory tract in whom a LMA or an uncuffed orotracheal tube have been used. Methods: Four hundred patients were enrolled aged 6 months to 12 years undergoing general anaesthesia for elective body surface surgery with insertion of the LMA (group M) or the uncuffed tube (group T). Acute inflammation of the upper airways (URI) was assessed, defined by the presence of at least two of the following symptoms, rhinorrhea, coughing, pharyngodynia, disphony, fever, malaise. The appearance of post-surgical adverse respiratory events (ARE), such as laryngospasm, stridor, disphony, excessive coughing was detected. Patients were divided into four groups in relation to the management of the airway and the presence or otherwise of URI (M URI, M NO URI, T URI, T NO URI). Results: In NO URI patients, the presence of ARE was 9.6% in the M and 36.9% in the T group (p < 0.001); in URI patients, these figures were respectively 31.5% and 73.9% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The frequency of ARE increases significantly in URI patients with both LMA and the tracheal tube, but with the former is far lower than with the latter. Despite the appearance of only minor and transient complications, it is confirmed that the tracheal intubation is an additional risk factor as a result of the mechanical airway simulation. In recent URI, it would seem appropriate to avoid tracheal intubation, if possible, preferring the LMA.",0,0
17869983,"Dental injury associated with anesthesia: a report of 161,687 anesthetics given over 14 years","Study objective: To determine the frequency, outcomes, and risk factors for dental injury related to anesthesia. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Tertiary-care university hospital. Patients: Patients who had a perianesthetic dental injury between August of 1989 and December 31, 2003. Measurements: A 1:2 case control study was done to identify the frequency, outcomes, and risk factors for dental injury. Perianesthetic dental injuries were defined as any notable change to the patient's dentition during the perianesthetic period that may or may not have required dental consultation or treatment. Main results: Seventy-eight patients with perianesthetic dental injury were identified. The incidence of dental injury was one per 2,073 anesthetics. Eighty-six percent of dental injuries were discovered by the anesthesia provider. Maxillary incisors were the most frequently injured teeth. The most commonly reported injuries were enamel fracture, loosened or subluxated teeth, tooth avulsion, and crown or root fracture. Patients with poor dentition or reconstructive work, whose tracheas were moderately difficult or difficult to intubate, were at much higher risk (approximately 20-fold) of dental injury than those with good dentition and found to be easy to intubate. Among those whose tracheas were easy to intubate, patients with poor dentition or reconstructive work were 3.4 times more likely to have dental injuries related to anesthesia. Conclusions: Dental injury is one of the most common adverse events reported in association with anesthesia. Risk factors include preexisting poor dentition or reconstructive work and moderately difficult to difficult intubation.",0,0
10219152,Traumatic injuries of the teeth in connection with general anaesthesia and the effect of use of mouthguards,"The aim of the present study was to describe the frequency of dental injuries over a 10-year period, where a mouthguard was used in approximately 10% of intubation cases or endoscopying. The types of injury are presented and the use of different types of mouthguard is discussed. Among 120,086 procedures involving anaesthesia carried out in the period 1983-1992 at Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, 75 cases of dental trauma occurred. The incidence of dental traumatic injuries was 0.06%. Although eight patients had used mouthguards they were registered with traumatic injuries to the teeth in connection with general anaesthesia. Of the patients, 58% were women and 42% men, with a mean age of 61 years. Seventy-eight percent of the injuries were located in the maxilla and 91% of these involved the incisor area of the maxilla. Forty-one percent were classified as lateral luxations or mobile teeth, 47% were classified as fractured teeth, 10% tooth avulsions and the remaining 2% were classified as concussions. Because of the low frequency of traumatic dental injuries in connection with general anaesthesia and the non-significant effect of the use of mouthguards, routine use of mouthguards is not recommended. Only when a patient is to have an endoscopy done under general anaesthesia, and the surgeon or anaesthesiologist foresees problems (restricted mouth opening, extensive fixed prosthetics, extensive loss of marginal bone) is use of an individually made mouthguard indicated.",0,0
17457122,Submandible angle in nonobese patients with difficult tracheal intubation,"Background: Although functional immobility of craniofacial structures during direct laryngoscopy may cause difficult tracheal intubation (DTI), there may be an unfavorable specific craniofacial feature for successful tracheal intubation. The aim of this study was to identify the specific craniofacial features associated with DTI. Methods: Digital photographs of nonobese patients with DTI (23 males and 18 females) and age- and body mass index-matched patients with easy tracheal intubation (ETI) (16 males and 16 females) were taken and used for measurements of various craniofacial dimensions. Composite facial pictures of each patient group were constructed for visualization of differences of the craniofacial features. Results: Mandible position angle was significantly smaller in DTI males than in male patients with ETI. Submandible angle was significantly larger in both male and female DTI patients than in patients with ETI. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the submandible angle was a significant and independent variable associated with DTI among the craniofacial dimensions for both sexes. The specific craniofacial features were visually more evident in the profile in than frontal composites. Conclusion: Increased submandible angle characterizes craniofacial features of patients with DTI.",0,0
10077371,Airway epithelium of transplanted lungs with and without direct bronchial artery revascularization,"Objective: Normal systemic blood flow to the airways and lung parenchyma of transplanted lungs can only be re-established by direct bronchial artery revascularization. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether such direct bronchial artery revascularization would preserve ciliary function, previously shown to be reduced in lungs transplanted without revascularization. Methods: Twenty-five single lung transplanted patients were included in this study. Complete direct bronchial artery revascularization was achieved in eight patients. In 16 patients the procedure had either failed (n = 10) or was not attempted (n = 6). In one patient the result of the revascularization was unknown. Airway epithelium samples were obtained from the native and the transplanted lungs during bronchoscopic examinations. Airway erythema and excessive secretion were registered. The epithelium samples underwent histological examination and ciliary beat frequency was measured in vitro by video recording. Transbronchial biopsies from the transplanted lungs were examined for signs of rejection and bronchitis. Results: No differences in ciliary beat frequency nor in the distribution of ciliated/de-ciliated columnar epithelium cells between native lungs and transplanted lungs with or without successful direct bronchial artery revascularization could be demonstrated. In 38% of the transplanted lungs without successful revascularization metaplastic or squamous epithelium was present, while lungs with successful revascularization had only normal columnar epithelium. Ongoing rejection or airway erythema did not influence ciliary beat frequency. Excessive secretion in the airways was the only finding associated with significantly increased ciliary beat frequency. Conclusions: Ciliary beat frequency of epithelium cells of transplanted lungs did not differ from that of native lungs and consequently direct bronchial artery revascularization did not have any demonstrable important influence. Excessive secretion in the airways was associated with increased ciliary beat frequency. The histological findings also showed that the abundance of ciliated cells was preserved in transplanted bronchi irrespective of bronchial artery revascularization. However, epithelium metaplasia was only seen in transplanted bronchi without revascularization.",0,0
21830315,A comparison of fluoroscopic airway screening with flexible bronchoscopy for diagnosing tracheomalacia,"Background: Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is the gold standard method of diagnosing tracheomalacia but it is not always feasible in settings with limited resources. Fluoroscopy is sometimes performed as an alternative diagnostic tool but there are no prospective studies that have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of airway fluoroscopy for tracheomalacia using a-priori definitions. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood predictive ratio of airway fluoroscopy compared with FB in children suspected of having an airway abnormality. Methods: Airway fluoroscopic examination was undertaken within 2-weeks of a FB in children aged <18-years and reported by a pediatric radiologist blinded to FB data. Fluoroscopic and FB methods and diagnostic criteria were standardized and defined a-priori. Tracheomalacia diagnosed by FB were independently scored (mild, moderate, severe) by 2 pulmonologists in a blinded manner. Results: In 22 children (median age 33 months, range 1-187) evaluated for airway abnormality, tracheomalacia was found in 21 children at bronchoscopy. Of these, fluoroscopy detected tracheomalacia in five children. Airway fluoroscopy was poorly sensitive (23.8%) but highly specific (100%), positive likelihood ratio was 8.6. However, in moderate-severe tracheomalacia, the sensitivity improved to 57.1% but the specificity reduced (93.3%). The agreement between bronchoscopists for tracheomalacia severity was excellent, weighted kappa 0.74 (95% CI 0.77, 0.98). Conclusion: Airway fluoroscopy cannot replace FB which remains the tool for definitively diagnosing airway malacia. However, in absence of other modalities for diagnosis fluoroscopy should be considered in the setting of persistent respiratory symptoms compatible with the clinical picture of tracheomalacia.",0,0

Intervention: Nasotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy under general anaesthesia was performed unless the supine position was not tolerated, or difficult mask ventilation or intubation was anticipated, when awake nasotracheal fibre-optic intubation was indicated. In the case of failure at the first attempt, orotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy was attempted. If failure persisted, tracheotomy was then performed. Main outcome measures: The principal endpoint was the incidence of difficult mask ventilation which was expected to be less than 5%. Secondary endpoints were the incidence of difficult tracheal intubation and tracheotomy. Results: We included 127 consecutive patients (mouth opening 20±10 mm). One did not tolerate the supine position and was successfully intubated using the fiberscope. Among the 126 remaining, difficult mask ventilation did not occur [0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0-3%], 124 (98%) patients were intubated by direct laryngoscopy and two (2%) required tracheotomy. Retrognathia (odds ratio 8.2, 95% CI 1.3-50.1) and extension to oral floor (odds ratio 15.1, 95% CI 1.8-129.5) were significantly associated with the prediction of intubation failure at the first attempt. Conclusion: Most patients with dental cellulitis can be safely intubated through direct laryngoscopy even if mouth opening is limited.",0,0
11983670,Co-administration of alfentanil-propofol improves laryngeal mask airway insertion compared to fentanyl-propofol,"Purpose: Insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) requires sufficient depth of anesthesia to relax the jaw and obtund airway reflexes. Recent studies suggest that the short-acting opioid alfentanil provides the best insertion conditions. We therefore compared the insertion conditions following co-administration of alfentanil-propofol with more commonly used fentanyl-propofol. Methods: One hundred forty ASA I or II patients, age 18-81 yr, requiring minor surgery were recruited. They were randomized to receive either alfentanil (10 microg x kg(-1); n = 73) or fentanyl (1 microg x kg(-1); n = 67) with propofol (2.5 mg x kg(-1)) 90 sec prior to LMA (size 3 or 4) insertion. A six variable (mouth opening, ease of insertion, swallowing, coughing, movement and laryngospasm) three-point (nil / partial / total) score was used to assess insertion conditions. Duration of post-insertion apnea was recorded. Insertion conditions were compared using Chi-square for trends. Results: The two groups were demographically similar. Mouth opening and ease of insertion were not improved with alfentanil co-administration. Alfentanil-propofol reduced the incidence of swallowing, gagging, movement and laryngospasm (P < 0.05), with 29% (alfentanil) compared to 45% (fentanyl) of patients responding (P = 0.05) to LMA insertion. Apnea [mean (SD)] following alfentanil lasted 154 (139) sec compared to 82 (61) sec following fentanyl (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Co-administration of alfentanil-propofol provided better insertion conditions than fentanyl-propofol, though apnea was prolonged by 72 sec.",0,0
17484653,Laparoscopic nephrectomy in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis: surgical and anesthetic challenges,"A 55-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis was referred with left sided loin pain, loin mass, and painless macroscopic hematuria. Physical examination revealed a palpable loin mass, fixed flexion deformity of the lumbar and cervical spines, with severely restricted cervical movement and mouth opening. An ultrasound and computed tomography scan confirmed a 7-cm solid mass in the left kidney. Following a multidisciplinary meeting he elected to undergo radical laparoscopic nephrectomy. An anesthetic opinion was sought in view of the expected difficulties with intubation. Mouth opening was restricted to 3 fingers and he was Mallampati grade 3 on airway examination. As the degree of spinal flexion deformity and restricted spinal movement was significant, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position, and surgery was performed using a transperitoneal approach. A five-port technique was employed and was carried out successfully with no complication. Operative time was 240 minutes and estimated blood loss was 700 mL. His postoperative inpatient stay was 4.5 days. Surgical margins were clear and the patient was disease-free at 2-year follow-up. Laparoscopic nephrectomy in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis is technically challenging for both the surgeon and the anesthetist, however, with the right preoperative planning, potential morbidity can be limited to ensure a good outcome for the patient.",0,0
25289371,Inhalation anesthesia in a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum: a case report,"Introduction: Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is defined by extreme sensitivity to sunlight and UV radiation and characterized by skin lesions and neuromuscular abnormalities. It is caused by a molecular defect in nucleotide excision repair genes. It has been reported that volatile anesthetics may cause genotoxic side effects or aggravation of the neurological signs. We report an XP patient with difficult intubation whose airway was controlled with Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) and was anesthetized with sevoflurane. Case presentation: A 23-year-old woman, who had been a known case of XP since her childhood, was admitted to our hospital for excision of face mass (SCC) and skin graft surgery. Her airway examination revealed some anatomical and pathological abnormalities, including limitation of mouth opening, jaw protrusion, head extension, and class 4 of mallampati, all predicting difficult intubation. We chose general anesthesia with inhalation induction, LMA insertion and maintenance with sevoflurane without muscle relaxant. The surgery was completed uneventfully and the patient left the hospital the day after the surgery without any new complaint. Conclusions: We suggest that for XP patients with compromised air-way, sevoflurane (not all volatiles) may be preferred.",0,0
19857405,Determination of difficult intubation in the ED,"Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the predictors of difficult intubation in the emergency setting. Methods: This prospective observational clinical study was conducted in the emergency department (ED) of a University Hospital with an annually census of 50 000 visits from May 2005 to May 2007. All patients requiring intubation in the ED were included into the study. During the study period, same airway management protocol was used all intubations. The study form included patient's demographic and variables according to intubation such as the Cormack-Lehane grade, modified LEMON score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, success rate, and associated complications. Results: A total of 366 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the study patients was 46.8 +/- 22.8, and 68.6% (n = 251) of them were male. A total of 86 (23.5%) patients were classified in the difficult intubation group and 280 (76.5%) patients in easy intubation group. Logistic regression analysis performed by the variables found to be significant in the univariate analysis revealed thyroid-to-hyoid distance less than 2 fingers (odds ratio, 3.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-8.27; P = .009) as an independent factor complicating the intubation. Cormack and Lehane classification was strongly related to difficult intubation. Intubation was more difficult from grade 1 to 4 (11% vs 25.2% vs 34% vs 81.8%, respectively; P = .000). Conclusions: The thyroid-to-hyoid distance less than 2 fingers is the only independent variable in predicting difficult intubation. Mallampati classification is not a useful tool in classifying the difficult intubation in the ED that the ""LEMON"" acrostic can be modified to ""LEON"".",1,1
21189852,Assessment of difficult laryngoscopy by electronically measured maxillo-pharyngeal angle on lateral cervical radiograph: A prospective study,"Background: Difficult airway continued to be a major cause of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Successful airway management depends on direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Difficult laryngoscopy is a resultant of incomplete structural arrangements during the process of head positioning. Through clinical history, examination of the patients along with craniofacial indices alerts the anesthetist for difficult laryngoscopy. But it does not predict all causes of difficult laryngoscopy during pre-anesthetic evaluation. The maxillo-pharyngeal angle, an upper airway anatomical balance, was proposed for better understanding the pathophysiology of difficult laryngoscopy. In our study we have assess difficult laryngoscopy by electronically measuring maxillo-pharyngeal angles on a lateral cervical radiograph. This angle is normally greater than 100°. Less than 90° angle suggests either impossible or difficult direct laryngoscopy when all known craniofacial indices were within the normal range. Cervical radiographic assessment is a simple, economical, and non-invasive predictive method for difficult laryngoscopy. It should be used routinely along with other indices as pre-anesthetic airway assessment criteria to predict the difficult laryngoscopy. Context: Difficulties with airway management continue to be a major cause of anesthesia-related morbidity, mortality, and litigation. Pre-operative assessment of difficult laryngoscopy by the simple and non-invasive radiological method can help to prevent them. Aims: To assess the difficult laryngoscopy pre operatively by a simple and non invasive radiological method by electronically measuring maxillo-pharyngeal angle on a lateral cervical radiograph and it's correlation with Cormack and Lehane grading. Settings and design: This is a controlled, nonrandomized, prospective, cohort observation study. Patients and methods: The 157 adult consented patients of ASA grade I to III of either sex, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia with endo-tracheal intubation, were studied. The patients with identified difficult airway indices were excluded from the study. The maxillo-pharyngeal angle was electronically measured on a lateral cervical radiograph and was correlated with ease or difficulty of laryngoscopy under general anesthesia. Their degree of laryngeal exposure according to Cormack and Lehane classification grade was also noted. Statistical analysis used: We performed univariate analyses to evaluate the association between the covariates and direct laryngoscopy. Results: In 148 patients (94.28%), the maxillo-pharyngeal angle was more than 100°, in 7 patients (4.45%) it was less than 90°, and in 2 patients (1.27%) the M-P angle was less than 85° with normal craniofacial indices. When the MP angle was less than 90°, the direct laryngoscopy was difficult which could be compared with to Cormack and Lehane classification grade III and IV. Conclusions: Lateral cervical radiographic assessment should be used as pre-anesthetic airway assessment criteria to predict the difficult laryngoscopy as it is a simple, safe and non-invasive method.",0,0
10984846,The difficult airway,"The difficult airway, although rare, still occurs with a frequency sufficient to require that all personnel associated with airway management be familiar with methods to use when confronted with a challenging airway. Methods of airway assessment are helpful but lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. The most effective means of anticipating a difficult airway lies in an integrated approach utilizing the history, physical exam, and the patient's medical record. The most effective manner of dealing with a difficult airway involves proper anticipation, patient preparation, and the development of practical, well thought out contingency plans. Most importantly, extubation must only occur after a plan has been designed to ensure that the patient may be adequately supported in the event of a premature extubation. Certain injuries to the airway and esophagus are more common in patients in whom intubation was difficult. Such patients should be closely watched and informed about the signs and symptoms of tracheal and esophageal injury.",0,0
11452466,[The intubating laryngeal mask: its advantages and limitations],"It has been hypothesized that the intubating laryngeal mask (ILM) has some advantages: (1) tracheal intubation is achieved with a neutral head-neck position and limited mouth opening, (2) intubation is not interfered with blood and secretion in the mouth, (3) ventilation via the device is possible, and (4) it is easy to use. Many studies have brought evidences for these points. Actually, cervical spine movement is unavoidable to a small extent although tracheal intubation is possible with a neutral head-neck position. Degree of hemodynamic changes and incidences of postoperative airway complications are similar between the ILM and the laryngoscope. ILM-users should pay attention to these limitations when they use the ILM.",0,0

Preoperative assessment showed limited mouth opening, head extension, and kyphosis. Intubation with a size 4 mm endotracheal tube (ETT) was achieved with fiberoptic bronchoscopy, after which surgery proceeded uneventfully and the ETT was carefully removed. Copious airway secretions required frequent suctioning. On the second postoperative day, respiratory status stabilized, and the patient was discharged home.",0,0
19219502,Chronic sleep complaints in premenopausal women and their association with sleep-disordered breathing,"Background: In clinical practice, we have found that premenopausal women have delayed diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Methods: During a 4-year period, we systematically collected the clinical and polysomnographic variables for all women referred for sleep complaints using preestablished questionnaires, scales, clinical grid, polygraphic montage, and scoring criteria. The variables collected on premenopausal SDB women were analyzed and compared to those of postmenopausal women within 5 years of menopause. Results: Of 977 women, 316 were premenopausal with SDB. Complaints of chronic insomnia and sleepwalking were the most common reasons for referral, had been present for a mean of 6.4 +/- 5.4 years, and had lead to unsuccessful symptomatic treatment. The normal-weight premenopausal SDB group had anatomically small upper airways, while those with body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 kg/m(2) complained more frequently of snoring and daytime sleepiness and their clinical presentation was closer to those of the postmenopausal SDB comparison group. Premenopausal women often had a low apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), but there was a discrepancy between the low AHI and the amount of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) needed to control the SDB, and there was a need for higher pressures in overweight premenopausal SDB women (mean 9.1 +/- 1.9 and 10.1 +/- 2.6 cmH(2)O). Conclusion: Normal-weight premenopausal SDB women often present with atypical sleep complaints of chronic insomnia and parasomnias. Clinical attention paid to craniofacial features and use of specific scales such as Mallampati help with the suspicion of the presence of SDB, and a low AHI is unrelated to the positive clinical impact of nasal CPAP treatment.",0,0
20028998,Comparison of four manikins and fresh frozen cadaver models for direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation training,"Objective: To compare the acceptability and preference between manikin models and fresh frozen cadaver (FFC) for direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation training. Methods: In this prospective crossover trial, participants in the airway workshop performed direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation on four airway training manikins: Airway Management Trainer (Ambu, St Ives, UK), Airway Trainer (Laerdal, Medical, Stavanger, Norway), Airsim (Trucorp, Belfast, Northern Ireland) and ""Bill 1"" (VBM, Sulz, Germany), and FFC. Participants were asked to access the following: reality of jaw mobility, difficulty with mouth opening, reality of neck flexibility, difficulty with intubation, overall model reality and model preference for each model using a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0-10 cm. The VAS scores for each model were compared. Results: Fifty-six participants were included in the study. The FFC had a highest VAS score for reality of jaw mobility, overall reality and preference of model. Trucorp manikin and Laerdal manikin followed cadaver. There were no significant statistical differences between Trucorp manikin and Laerdal manikin. In difficulty with mouth opening and difficulty with intubation, Trucorp manikin had the lowest VAS score. Conclusion: The FFC is a more realistic and preferred model for direct laryngoscopic orotracheal intubation training. Trucorp and Laerdal manikin can be used as alternative models.",0,0
22366848,Accuracy of identification of the cricothyroid membrane in female subjects using palpation: an observational study,"Background: The cricothyroid membrane (CTM) is the recommended site of access to the airway during cricothyroidotomy to provide emergency oxygenation. Despite the apparent simplicity of the technique, this rescue maneuver frequently fails to achieve its goals and complications are numerous. The reasons for this failure are unclear. We sought to determine the ability of physicians to correctly identify the CTM in female patients. Methods: Using fluorescent ""invisible"" ink, the physician was asked to mark the CTM with the patient in the supine neutral position and then with the head extended. The actual level was identified using ultrasound and the distance between the actual and estimated margin of the CTM was measured. A correct estimation was defined as a mark made between the upper and lower limits of the membrane and within 5 mm of midline. Participants were also asked to assess the ease of CTM palpation using a 10-cm visual analog scoring (VAS) scale. Results: Fifty-six patients participated of whom 15 were obese. In the supine neutral neck position, the CTM was identified in 10/41 vs 0/15 (P = 0.048) in nonobese versus obese, respectively. Of the 46 incorrectly identified CTMs in this position, 24 were above (maximum 3 cm) and 22 below (maximum 3 cm) the actual level. Similar results were observed when the patients were placed with the neck in the extended position; the CTM was identified correctly in 12/41 vs 1/15 nonobese and obese patients, respectively. The range of values was also extensive; the estimation of the position of the membrane was as high as 2.5 cm above and 4 cm below the actual level, and up to 1.6 cm laterally. Participating doctors found palpation of the CTM subjectively more difficult in the obese than nonobese groups; VAS score for palpation difficulty was 5.25 ± 2.5 vs 3.3 ± 2.5, respectively, P = 0.005. Using multiple linear regression, VAS scores for palpation correlated negatively with increased patient height (P < 0.001) and greater thyromental distance (P = 0.006), and correlated positively with increased sternomental distance (P = 0.011) and neck circumference (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Misidentification of the CTM in female patients is common and its localization is less precise in those who are obese. This has implications for the likely success of invasive airway access via the CTM.",0,0
25721326,A comparison of the McGrath® Series 5 videolaryngoscope and Macintosh laryngoscope for double-lumen tracheal tube placement in patients with a good glottic view at direct laryngoscopy,"We compared the McGrath® Series 5 videolaryngoscope with the Macintosh laryngoscope for double-lumen tracheal tube placement in patients with a predicted good glottic view on assessment of the airway. An initial laryngoscopy was performed using the Macintosh laryngoscope; 96 patients with Cormack and Lehane grade-1 or -2a views were randomly assigned to undergo intubation using either the McGrath or Macintosh device. Compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, the McGrath videolaryngoscope provided more Cormack and Lehane grade-1 views (47 (97.9%) vs 29 (60.4%), p < 0.05), a longer mean (SD) intubation time (39.6 (10.0) s vs 24.4 (7.3) s, p < 0.05) and a higher incidence of double-lumen tube malposition (6 (12.5%) vs 0, p < 0.05). However, in 18 non-randomised patients with Cormack and Lehane grade ≥ 2b on initial laryngoscopy using the Macintosh, the glottic view was improved on intubation with the McGrath videolaryngoscope, with a total success rate of double-lumen tube placement of 94.4% and mean (SD) intubation time of 50.0 (18.6) s. We recommend that in patients with a low airway risk index score requiring intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube, the Macintosh laryngoscope is used as the first device and the McGrath videolaryngoscope is used only if this provides a poor glottic view.",0,0
10553855,"Pressures exerted against the cervical vertebrae by the standard and intubating laryngeal mask airways: a randomized, controlled, cross-over study in fresh cadavers","In this randomized, controlled, cross-over study, we measured the pressures exerted by the standard laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILM) against the cervical vertebrae during insertion, intubation, and maneuvers commonly used to facilitate intubation. We also assessed the effect of these pressures on cervical spine (C-spine) movement. Twenty cadavers (6-24 h postmortem) without cervical abnormality were initially studied. Three microchip pressure sensors were implanted into the pharyngeal surface of C2-3. The size 5 ILM and LMA were inserted in random order into each cadaver with the head-neck in the neutral position. Maximal cervical pressures (CPmax) were recorded for both devices during cuff inflation from 0-40 mL and with the intracuff pressure (ICP) at 60 cm H2O, insertion, fiberscope-guided intubation, partial withdrawal/reinsertion (ILM only), elevation/depression of the handle with 20 N of force applied (ILM only). In five additional matched cadavers, the effect of pressure on posterior displacement of C3 was assessed, and CPmax was measured during laryngoscope- and fiberscope-guided oro/nasotracheal intubation (controls). CPmax was higher for the ILM than the LMA over the inflation range (96 vs 15 cm H2O; P < 0.0001) and with the ICP at 60 cm H2O (95 vs 10 cm H2O; P < 0.0001). During cuff inflation, CPmax was generally unchanged for the ILM but was always increased for the LMA. CPmax for the LMA and ILM was similar during insertion (224 vs 273 cm H2O) but higher for the ILM during fiberscope-guided intubation (96 vs 43 cm H2O; P < 0.0001). At 60 cm H2O ICP, CPmax increased during LMA (224 cm H2O; P < 0.0001) and ILM insertion (273 cm H2O; P < 0.0001) and increased for the LMA (43 cm H2O; P < 0.0001) but was unchanged for the ILM (96 cm H2O) during fiberscope-guided intubation. For the ILM, CP-max increased during handle depression (394 cm H2O; P < 0.0001) and partial withdrawal/reinsertion (265 cm H2O; P < 0.0001) but decreased during handle elevation (6 cm H2O; P < 0.00001). CPmax for the controls was usually zero and was always less than the LMA/ ILM (P < 0.0001). The mean (range) for posterior displacement of C3 was 0.8 (0-2) mm at 100 cm H2O and 2.8 (1-5) mm at 400 cm H2O. Laryngeal mask devices exert greater pressures against the cervical vertebrae than established intubation techniques and can produce posterior displacement of the C-spine. Implications: Laryngeal mask devices exert greater pressures against the cervical vertebrae than established intubation techniques and can produce posterior displacement of the cervical spine. We recommend that laryngeal mask devices only be used in the unstable cervical spine if difficulties are anticipated or encountered with established techniques, pending the results of studies demonstrating its relative safety.",0,0
8087908,Analysis of mathematical model for osseous factors in difficult intubation,"A two-dimensional model of the factors relevant to difficult laryngoscopy was analysed mathematically to determine clinical implications and limitations. The model describes the space into which the ""inevitable residual volume"" of the tongue (that part remaining anterior to the blade at laryngoscopy) can be displaced to permit a view of the larynx. Four points are used: the tip of the upper incisors; a point on the anterior airway just above the larynx; the mid-point between the mandibular condyles and the internal mid-point of the symphysis. The number, F, was defined by a formula developed from their spacial relationships. Decreasing F values imply an increasing likelihood of difficult laryngoscopy. The analysis investigated the effects of: translation of individual points; plotting individual point positions for specified F-values; translating adjacent pairs of points; treating any three points as a triangle which rotates about each of its apices; and lastly, translating three points independently. During manipulations the model behaved well mathematically. Single point analysis implied that jaw recession and a non-protruding mandible were comparable in effect. Closing the mouth around the laryngoscope blade maximised F-values. Prominence of the maxilla required greater forward displacement than backward movement of the symphysis for equivalent F-value change. One particular triangular rotation suggested an entirely novel mechanism for difficulty (the ""hi-slung mandible"") where the condyles are positioned more rostral than normal. An otherwise normal jaw with this configuration recedes markedly on opening. Further studies are required to validate the model. Accurate quantification of individual factors in difficult laryngoscopy may then be feasible.",0,0
15766344,Comparison of the Flexiblade levering laryngoscope with the English Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with a poor laryngoscopic view,"The effectiveness of two laryngoscopes, the English Macintosh and the Flexiblade (a levering laryngoscope), were compared in a clinical setting. An investigation was carried out in 100 patients admitted for surgery under general anaesthesia, to compare intubation with the Flexiblade or the Macintosh laryngoscope. The patients had two anatomical characteristics that may predict difficult intubation - Mallampati score II and III, and a thyromental distance </= 6.5 cm. Patients were randomly allocated to receive intubation with one of the laryngoscopes. The laryngeal view obtained during laryngoscopy, the intubation time, and the need for optimization manoeuvres and assistance required were compared in the two groups. The correlation between intubation time and anatomical characteristics was determined. Only 49 patients had a poor laryngeal view during initial laryngoscopy and required additional facilitating manoeuvres. In these patients, successful intubation time (in seconds) using the Flexiblade was significantly shorter than using the Macintosh laryngoscope (median 14.3 s, IQR 12.0-18.4 s [corrected] vs. median 20.8 s, IQR 14.9-25.5 s (U = 165, [corrected] p , 0.01). Assistance and additional manoeuvres were required significantly less frequently in the Flexiblade group (21%) compared to Macintosh group (67%) (p < 0.01). No correlation was found between intubation time, Mallampati scores, thyromental distance, or body weight. We concluded that in patients with an initial poor laryngoscopic view, the Flexiblade may enable faster and easier tracheal intubation.",0,0
18559351,LMA-Supreme--a new single-use LMA with gastric access: a report on its clinical efficacy,"Background: LMA-Supreme (SLMA) is a new, single-use, latex-free, laryngeal mask airway with gastric access. The anatomically shaped airway tube permits easy insertion without placing fingers in the patient's mouth. The cuff is designed to provide higher seal pressures than the LMA-Classic or Unique. Methods: A prospective, randomized, cross-over study of LMA-Proseal (PLMA) and SLMA in 36 fasted, adult, female patients with general anaesthesia, neuromuscular block (NMB) and positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is presented. Results: First attempt insertion in 35/36 patients in each group (two attempts in one PLMA and three in one SLMA patient) with successful PPV in all. Median insertion time (15 s) and glottic seal pressure (28 cm H(2)O) were similar in both groups. Median volume of air for cuff inflation to 60 cm H(2)O was 22.4 ml (PLMA) and 21.9 ml (SLMA). Median age and BMI: 50 yr (range 25-74), 51 yr (23-72) and 29 kg m(-2) (range 21-46), 30 kg m(-2) (20-42) in PLMA and SLMA groups, respectively. Mallampati score mean arterial pressures after induction, and 1 min after induction and insertion of the first device were similar. A lubricated gastric tube (16Fr) was passed at the first attempt in both devices: median gastric content 15 ml (5-75), 17.5 (5-124) and a median pH of 3 (1-6), 1.5 (1-6) in the PLMA and SLMA groups, respectively. Fibreoptic laryngoscopic scores of 1-2 were recorded in 29/36 in both groups. Conclusions: Insertion success, glottic seal pressure and gastric access were similar in SLMA and PLMA.",0,0
23281247,Bronchoscopic assessment of airway involvement in children presenting with clinically significant airway obstruction due to tuberculosis,"Introduction: The incidence of complicated lymph node disease in tuberculosis (TB) in children less than 15 years of age varies from 8% to 38%. There are few published studies on the bronchoscopic appearance and severity of airway obstruction caused by lymph node involvement of the airways resulting from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The primary aim of the study was to describe the flexible bronchoscopic findings of lymph node involvement of the airways caused by MTB in children with severe airway obstruction. The secondary aim was to compare the degree of airway involvement in HIV negative to HIV positive children as well the airway involvement caused by drug susceptible and drug resistant MTB. Patients and methods: All children between 1 month and 13 years of age presenting with clinical and radiological signs of significant airway obstruction suspected of being the result of MTB infection were studied. In addition to routine examination for MTB disease a flexible bronchoscope and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for MTB culture were performed on all the children. Results: Two hundred fifty children (16% HIV positive) were studied. Median age was 14 months and the median weight 8.5 kg. MTB was cultured from 78% (n = 194) of children with the BAL positive in 44%. The BAL culture yield was significantly higher in children with radiological evidence of pneumonia when compared to children with airway involvement alone (P = 0.004). The bronchial tree was obstructed on the right in 85% (n = 212), the left in 66% (n = 164), and both sides in 53% (n = 132) of cases. The commonest sites of obstruction were bronchus intermedius (72%) and left main bronchus (62%). Drug resistance was present in 16% (n = 28). There was no difference in the site or severity of obstruction when comparing drug susceptible to drug resistant cases or HIV positive to HIV negative children. Conclusions: Bronchus intermedius and left main bronchus were the commonest sites of airway obstruction. The MTB culture yield from BAL was higher in children with pneumonia when compared to those with airway involvement alone. HIV positive or children with drug resistant TB did not have more severe airway obstruction.",0,0
19854521,Evaluation of the upper airway in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may be associated with the presence of upper airway obstruction caused by chronic infection and nasal polyposis that may also contribute to OSAS severity. Our objective was to identify the profile of findings in CF and OSAS patients by performing upper airway examinations. Methodology: Observational, cross-sectional study involving 63 children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 14 with CF. All patients answered a questionnaire and underwent a standard otolaryngology examination, including an endoscopic nasal and nocturnal polysomnography. OSAS diagnosis was confirmed if the obstructive apnea index was >or=1. Results: OSAS was identified in 35 (55.6%) patients. The upper airway findings were evaluated using multiple correspondence factorial analysis. The OSAS group presented with overjet >2mm, enlarged pharyngeal pillars, palatine tonsils and pharyngeal tonsils hypertrophy, ogival hard palates and characteristics of chronic rhinosinusitis. Conclusion: Bone and soft tissue structural alterations of the upper airway and chronic rhinosinusitis were associated with the OSAS group patients.",0,0
24572486,The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation,"Background: The concurrence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is generally identified as an overlap syndrome. Only limited evidence is available on the prevalence of OSA in patients with stable COPD, and essentially no data on the prevalence of OSA in patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation. The aims of the study were to determine the ratio of concurrence of OSA in patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation and to identify the confounders of OSA detected in COPD subjects. Methods: 101 patients were hospitalized for COPD exacerbation at the Department of Respiratory Diseases in the course of four months. Seventy-nine consecutive patients were enrolled in the study and in 35 of these subjects polygraphy was performed. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation and Fisher's test were used to summarize and evaluate results. Results: In 18 (51.4%) subjects with polygraphy examination, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5 indicated the presence of OSA. The AHI value, and thus the severity of the sleep disorder, correlated with the class of the Mallampati score, presence of snoring, apnea, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus in patient's history, height, body mass index, neck, waist and hip circumferences, and the value of the Epworth sleepiness scale. Conclusion: Polygraphy performed in patients hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD indicated an increased prevalence of OSA compared to the general population and stable COPD patients.",0,0
25511370,Diagnostic accuracy of anaesthesiologists' prediction of difficult airway management in daily clinical practice: a cohort study of 188 064 patients registered in the Danish Anaesthesia Database,"Both the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the UK NAP4 project recommend that an unspecified pre-operative airway assessment be made. However, the choice of assessment is ultimately at the discretion of the individual anaesthesiologist. We retrieved a cohort of 188 064 cases from the Danish Anaesthesia Database, and investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the anaesthesiologists' predictions of difficult tracheal intubation and difficult mask ventilation. Of 3391 difficult intubations, 3154 (93%) were unanticipated. When difficult intubation was anticipated, 229 of 929 (25%) had an actual difficult intubation. Likewise, difficult mask ventilation was unanticipated in 808 of 857 (94%) cases, and when anticipated (218 cases), difficult mask ventilation actually occurred in 49 (22%) cases. We present a previously unpublished estimate of the accuracy of anaesthesiologists' prediction of airway management difficulties in daily routine practice. Prediction of airway difficulties remains a challenging task, and our results underline the importance of being constantly prepared for unexpected difficulties.",0,0
20108728,Airway management in a bleeding adult following tonsillectomy: a case report,"A 37-year-old morbidly obese man with a history of obstructive sleep apnea underwent elective tonsillectomy. The patient was successfully intubated with an 8.0-mm regular cuffed endotracheal tube. A large video laryngoscope (GlideScope, Verathon Inc, Bothell, Washington) was used for intubation, as airway assessment indicated a potentially difficult airway. The surgery was uneventful, but active bleeding was noticed in the oropharynx after extubation. The patient was reintubated, again with the use of a GlideScope. The bleeding site was cauterized, and the patient was extubated after meeting the criteria for an awake extubation. He was discharged home the following day. Eight days postoperatively, the patient returned to the emergency center with spontaneous bleeding from the oropharynx. He was taken to the operating room and, based on the previous GlideScope use, an attempt was made to intubate the patient with a GlideScope. The attempt failed, as the GlideScope screen was blurred by the presence of blood in the oropharynx, even though the oropharynx was suctioned. Resuctioning and reinsertion of the GlideScope probe did not provide an adequate visual field. After 2 failed attempts, the use of the GlideScope was abandoned. Subsequently, the patient's trachea was successfully intubated with a size 4 Macintosh blade.",0,0
26599736,Management of Near-Complete Airway Obstruction Caused by a Vallecular Cyst in an Infant Using a Tongue Tip Traction Suture,"Airway obstruction in infants can be because of a number of airway issues, one of which is a vallecular cyst. Although uncommonly seen, the management strategy for this difficult airway can be applied to many other difficult airway cases. We report the use of a preoperative oral fiberoptic assessment of the airway, use of a tongue stitch, and manipulation of a flexible nasal fiberoptic bronchoscope to secure the airway. Keeping the patient breathing spontaneously with low-dose ketamine also facilitated successful tracheal intubation.",0,0
9613299,The intubating laryngeal mask. Use in failed and difficult intubation,"The use of the intubating laryngeal mask in three patients is described. In two patients for whom tracheal intubation using traditional techniques had failed, the intubating laryngeal mask was used to achieve successful tracheal intubation. The trachea of one of these patients was subsequently re-intubated for a second procedure using the same technique. A third patient with a cervical spine fracture whose trachea was electively intubated using the intubating laryngeal mask is also presented.",0,0
2240543,Successful difficult intubation. Tracheal tube placement over a gum-elastic bougie,A randomised study was carried out to assess the effect of tracheal tube rotation on the passage of a tube over a gum-elastic bougie into the trachea in 100 patients. The effect of the presence or absence of a laryngoscope on successful tube placement was also assessed. A grade 3 difficult intubation was simulated in patients with a laryngoscope. There was a significant difference in the rates for successful first-time intubation in those patients with tube orientation of -90 degrees (with the bevel facing posteriorly) as compared with a tube orientation of 0 degrees (the normal orientation with the bevel facing left). The unsuccessful first-time intubations with a 0 degree orientation were frequently converted to successful intubations with the -90 degrees position at a second attempt. The presence of a laryngoscope in the mouth while rail-roading a tube over the bougie also made a significant difference to the rate of successful first-time intubations. The most successful method was to leave the laryngoscope in the mouth and rotate the tube to -90 degrees.,0,0
23047390,Impact factors for difficult cecal intubation during colonoscopy,"Background: There are no accepted means of identifying patients in whom colonoscopy is likely to be more difficult and allocate time accordingly. Aims: To identify patient-related, endoscopist-related, and procedure-related factors associated with difficult cecal intubation. Methods: This was a prospective study performed at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical Center, from January to December 2009. Data pertaining to patient information (age, sex, weight, waist circumference and buttock girth, bowel habit, and abdomen surgery history) were recorded prospectively. Procedure-specific information including the need to alter patient position, application of external compression, and cecal intubation time (CIT) was documented. Results: A total of 859 consecutive patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 50.5 ± 11.4 years. CIT was longer in women compared with men (410 ± 195 vs. 376 ± 224 s; P = 0.021). Older patients had longer CITs--an additional 2.1 seconds for each incremental year (P = 0.001), and poor bowel preparation increased CIT (P = 0.019). Patients who required a position change or abdominal compression took longer to reach the cecum (P<0.001). Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the importance of colon preparation and the need for abdominal compression and a change of position when performing a difficult colonoscopy.",0,0
15281517,"A new supraglottic airway, the Elisha Airway Device: a preliminary study","We describe the Elisha Airway Device (EAD), a new reusable supraglottic ventilatory device. Its uniqueness consists of its ability to combine three functions in a single device: ventilation, blind and/or fiberoptic-aided intubation without interruption of ventilation, and gastric tube insertion. This study was performed in 70 ASA status I-II, Mallampati class I-II patients undergoing elective knee arthroscopy and receiving general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and was maintained with isoflurane in N20/oxygen. Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with vecuronium. Blind insertion of the device was successful in 96% of patients, with a mean insertion time of 20 +/- 4 s. In these patients it was possible to maintain oxygenation and ventilation throughout the surgical procedure. Gastric tube insertion was successful in all cases. Endotracheal intubation via the EAD was attempted in 20 patients. Blind intubation was possible during the first and second attempts in 15 and 2 patients, respectively. Fiberoptic intubation was then successful in two of the remaining three patients. The EAD is a new alternative in the evolution of supraglottic ventilatory devices; however, further clinical studies are necessary to evaluate its efficacy.",0,0
27468254,Which oropharyngeal factors are significant risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea? An age-matched study and dentist perspectives,"Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep breathing disorder. Untreated OSA may lead to a number of cardiovascular complications. Dentists may play an important role in OSA detection by conducting careful oral examinations. This study focused on the correlation of oral anatomical features in Thai patients who presented with OSA. Methods: We conducted a prospective comparative study at a sleep/hypertension clinic and a dental clinic at Khon Kaen University in Thailand. Patients with OSA were enrolled in the study, along with age-matched patients with non-OSA (controls). Baseline characteristics, clinical data, and oropharyngeal data of all patients were compared between the two groups. Oropharyngeal measurements included tongue size, torus mandibularis, Mallampati classification, palatal space, and lateral pharyngeal wall area. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with OSA. Results: During the study period, there were 156 patients who met the study criteria; 78 were patients with OSA and the other 78 were healthy control subjects. In the OSA group, there were 43 males with a mean age of 53 (standard deviation 12.29) years and a mean BMI of 30.86 kg/mm(2). There were 37 males in the control group with a mean age of 50 (standard deviation 12.04) years and a mean BMI of 24.03 kg/mm(2). According to multivariate logistic analysis, three factors were perfectly associated with OSA, including torus mandibularis class 6, narrow lateral pharyngeal wall, and Mallampati class 4. There were two other significant factors associated with having OSA, namely, BMI and Mallampati classification. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of these two factors were 1.445 (1.017, 2.052) and 5.040 (1.655, 15.358), respectively. Conclusion: Dentists may play an important role in the detection of OSA in patients with high BMI through careful oropharyngeal examination in routine dental treatment. A large torus mandibularis, Mallampati class 4, and a narrow lateral pharyngeal wall are important anatomical risk factors for OSA.",0,0
15223446,Bronchoscopy simulator effectively prepares junior residents to competently perform basic clinical bronchoscopy,"Background: Teaching procedural skills in a clinical setting is becoming increasingly difficult. Simulators can provide safe and inexpensive skills training. This randomized study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a bronchoscopy simulator in teaching clinical bronchoscopy. Methods: Three groups of surgical residents were evaluated while performing an intraoperative flexible bronchoscopy. First year (PGY1) residents were randomly assigned to perform bronchoscopy either with (n = 5) or without (n = 5) preprocedural bronchoscopic simulator training (PreOp flexible bronchoscopic simulator, Immersion Medical, Gaithersburg, MD). Residents PGY2 to 3 (n = 3) with prior bronchoscopic experience (> or = 10 bronchoscopies) underwent evaluation without simulator training. Subjects were required to complete a systematic airway examination through a laryngeal mask airway with patients under general anesthesia. Evaluation criteria included procedure time, number of verbal and physical interventions by evaluator, and a rating of exam thoroughness, proficiency, and confidence. Results: The PGY1 subjects who trained on the simulator required significantly fewer verbal (6.2 +/- 1.6 vs 3.2 +/- 0.8) and physical (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs 0.2 +/- 0.4) cues and performed more systematic examinations (2.6 +/- 0.5 vs 4.4 +/- 0.9 on scale 1 to 5) than those who did not use the trainer. The skill level of PGY1 subjects who worked with the simulator was similar to that of PGY2 to 3 residents experienced in bronchoscopy. Procedural times were not different between groups as the evaluator maintained the pace of the examination using verbal and physical assistance. Conclusions: One hour of training with the bronchoscopic simulator effectively taught residents basic bronchoscopy and familiarity with airway anatomy. Residents using the trainer performed first-time bronchoscopy nearly as competently as residents experienced with bronchoscopy.",0,0
20112544,[Management of the easy or complicated airway by nonexperts using the AirTraq optical laryngoscope],"Objectives: To evaluate the utility of the AirTraq optical laryngoscope in a retrospective case series, assessing indications for use and benefits as well as possible limitations. Patients and methods: Retrospective study of the first 124 patients in whom we used the AirTraq for tracheal intubation. Anatomical and demographic variables were recorded in addition to preoperative findings on examination of the airway. Ease in accomplishing the maneuver and quality of the procedure were assessed after intubation with the AirTraq. Results: The trachea was correctly intubated in 97.6% of the patients. Intubation failed in only 3 (2.4%) patients. Laryngoscopic quality was optimal in over 95% of the cases. There were few complications or other events. Conclusions: The AirTraq laryngoscope has been shown to facilitate intubation even when nonexpert staff perform the maneuver in cases in which previous attempts at laryngoscopy have failed and in which a difficult airway is anticipated. Ease of use and relative safety make the AirTraq a practical device for a variety of patient types and clinical settings.",0,0
17164541,Assessment of airway caliber in quantitative videobronchoscopy,"Background: Quantitative assessment of airway caliber is generally confined to indirect methods. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy provides a direct view of the airways, but measurement of the internal size of bronchi in a standard examination is not possible. Using a special image analysis program, we developed a method allowing quantitative assessment of airway caliber by means of videobronchoscopic (VB) examination. Objectives: The purpose of the study was toshow that quantitative videobronchoscopy (VB coupled with a computer image analysis) allows direct and accurate measurement of the bronchi diameter. Methods: To test our hypothesis, we measured the same areas of a bronchial tree in CT and in VB in 40 patients with diagnostic indications for both the procedures. Results: We measured the diameters of 149 bronchi. The mean value of the difference between VB and CT measurements was equal to -0.071 mm and was not significantly different from 0 (p = 0.086). There was no obvious relation between the difference and the mean (r = 0.026, p = 0.745). The Bland Altman limits of agreement were L = -1.071 mm and U = 0.929 mm. We also assessed the bronchial diameter after endobronchial challenge and in patients with tracheobronchomalacia to show the application of this method for dynamic measurements. Conclusions: Quantitative videobronchoscopy allows the accurate and direct measurement of an airway caliber. It may be useful in clinical setting to quantify changes in a bronchial caliber (endobronchial masses, tracheobronchomalacia). Dynamic visualization of changes in airways may be useful in research, especially to explore the mechanics of airway narrowing.",0,0
10764176,Failed tracheal intubation using a laryngoscope and intubating laryngeal mask,"Purpose: To report unexpected failed tracheal intubation using a laryngoscope and an intubating laryngeal mask, and difficult ventilation via a facemask, laryngeal mask and intubating laryngeal mask, in a patient with an unrecognized lingual tonsillar hypertrophy. Clinical features: A 63-yr-old woman, who had undergone clipping of an aneurysm seven weeks previously, was scheduled for ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. At the previous surgery, there had been no difficulty in ventilation or in tracheal intubation. Her trachea remained intubated nasally for 11 days after surgery. Preoperatively, her consciousness was impaired. There were no restrictions in head and neck movements or mouth opening. The thyromental distance was 7 cm. After induction of anesthesia, manual ventilation via a facemask with a Guedel airway was suboptimal and the chest expanded insufficiently. At laryngoscopy using a Macintosh or McCoy device, only the tip of the epiglottis, but not the glottis, could be seen, and tracheal intubation failed. There was a partial obstruction during manual ventilation through either the intubating laryngeal mask or conventional laryngeal mask; intubation through each device failed. Digital examination of the pharynx, after removal of the laryngeal mask, indicated a mass occupying the vallecula. Lingual tonsillar hypertrophy (1 x 1 x 2 cm) was found to be the cause of the failure. Awake fibrescope-aided tracheal intubation was accomplished. Conclusions: Unexpected lingual tonsillar hypertrophy can cause both ventilation and tracheal intubation difficult, and neither the laryngeal mask nor intubating laryngeal mask may be helpful in the circumstances.",0,0
25821616,Tracheal agenesis: a challenging prenatal diagnosis-contribution of fetal MRI,"Tracheal agenesis is a rare congenital anomaly. The prevalence is less than 1 : 50 000 with a male to female ratio of 2 : 1. This anomaly may be isolated but, in 93% of cases, it is part of polymalformative syndrome. The most evocative diagnosis situation is the ultrasonographic congenital high airway obstruction syndrome. Dilated airways, enlarged lungs with flattened diaphragm, fetal ascites and severe nonimmune hydrops can be observed. In the absence of a congenital high airway obstruction syndrome, the antenatal diagnosis of tracheal agenesis is difficult. Tracheal agenesis should be suspected in the presence of an unexplained polyhydramnios associated with congenital malformations. The fetal airway exploration should then be systematically performed by fetal thoracic magnetic resonance imaging. A case of Floyd's type II tracheal agenesis, detected during the postnatal period, is reported here. The retrospective reexamination of fetal magnetic resonance images showed that the antenatal diagnosis would have been easy if a systematical examination of upper airways had been performed. Prenatal diagnosis of tracheal agenesis is possible with fetal MRI but the really challenge is to think about this pathology.",0,0
15907231,Predicting difficult intubation--a comparison between Mallampati classification and Wilson risk-sum,"Objective: To compare the Mallampati classification and Wilson risk-sum and adopt a predictive rule in our setup that has better results. Design: An analytical study. Place and duration of study: The main Operation Theatre of Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi from 1st September to 31st December 2000. Patients and methods: Three hundred and thirty-eight patients were evaluated pre-operatively for difficult intubation using both the tests. The sensitivities, specificities and positive predictive values (PPV) were determined in grading the laryngeal view in each case during direct laryngoscopy. Results: Both tests identified only 3 out of 7 difficult intubations, giving a similar sensitivity of 0.42. Twice as many patients were predicted to be difficult by Mallampati classification than by Wilson risk-sum (specificity 84% and 93%). The Wilson risk-sum had better positive predictive value (11%) as compared to 5% of Mallampati classification. Conclusion: The Wilson risk-sum had preferred for assessment of the airway because of its better specificity and positive predictive value while noting that both tests have poor sensitivities when used alone.",0,0
9661564,A comparison of the laryngeal mask airway and cuffed oropharyngeal airway in anesthetized adult patients,"We compared the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) with the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in 120 anesthetized adult patients. We compared 1) placement success rates, 2) airway interventional requirements, 3) airway stability in different head/neck positions, 4) cardiorespiratory tolerance, and 5) intra- and postoperative adverse events/symptoms. A standardized anesthesia protocol was followed by four anesthesiologists experienced with both devices. Observational data were validated by independent analysis of continuous video recordings. Postoperative interviews were double-blind to the device used. The LMA had a more frequent success rate than COPA (97% vs 55%, P < 0.00001), an overall higher success rate (100% vs 83%; P = 0.001), a shorter time to achieve an effective airway (49 vs 188 s; P < 0.00001), a higher oropharyngeal leak pressure (21 vs 16 cm H2O; P = 0.003), and a fewer number of chin lift airway interventions required (0.1% vs 42%; P < 0.00001). When comparing mean tidal volumes in different head/neck positions to assess airway stability, the quality of airway was unchanged in 98% patients with the LMA and 54% with the COPA (P < 0.00001). The incidences of intraoperative adverse events were similar. On removal, blood was detected more often on the COPA (3% vs 14%; P = 0.04). In the late postoperative period, more patients complained of adverse symptoms with the COPA than with the LMA (26% vs 57%; P = 0.001). Late postoperative symptoms occurred more frequently with the COPA (0.87 vs 0.34; P = 0.003). There was more late postoperative sore throat (14% vs 36%; P = 0.0003) and more jaw/neck pain (12% vs 26%; P = 0.0008) in patients managed with the COPA. This study demonstrates that the LMA offers advantages over the COPA in most technical aspects of airway management and in terms of postoperative morbidity. Implications: In this randomized, prospective study, we compared the laryngeal mask airway and the cuffed oropharyngeal airway in anesthetized patients. The laryngeal mask airway offers advantages in most technical aspects of airway management and in terms of postoperative morbidity.",0,0
19230424,Comparison of clinical and polysomnographic characteristics of non-obese and obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea,"Objective: To compare the clinical features, anthropometric indices, and polysomnographic data between different body mass index (BMI) subgroups of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Material and method: The authors reviewed the data from OSA patients in Siriraj Sleep Clinic from April 2005 to September 2006. Objective measurement for sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), anthropometric measurements [body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, thyromental distance, Mallampati S score, and occlusion pattern] and polysomnographic recordings [apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) during REM and NREM periods, respiratory arousal index, periodic leg movement index, minimal oxygen saturation, total sleep time with oxygen saturation <90%, and desaturation index] were collected. The patients were stratified into the non-obese group and obese group if their BMI was <27 or > or =27 kg/m2 respectively. Results: Of the total 158 patients, 71 were non-obese and 87 were obese, no difference in mean age and sex was observed, but more patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease were noted in the obese group. Mean ESS was not different between the 2 groups. In anthropometric measurements, the obese group had statistically significant large neck circumference (41.6 +/- 3.5 cm vs. 37.0 +/- 2.9 cm, p<0.001), but the nonobese group had a shorter thyromental distance (56.4 +/- 11.7 mm vs. 61.4 +/- 11.2 mm, p=0.006), with no significant difference in Mallampatis score and occlusion pattern. In polysomnographic data, the obese group had statistical significantly more severity of various indices except for AHI during the REM period and the periodic limb movement index. Conclusion: Non-obese obstructive sleep apnea patients have more bony structural change than the obese ones as demonstrated by shorter thyromental distance. But degree of abnormalities during sleep was less severe in nearly all aspects.",0,0
16973985,Airway eosinophilia in children with severe asthma: predictive values of noninvasive tests,"Rationale: Children with severe asthma experience persistent symptoms despite maximal conventional treatment. Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Fe(NO)) and sputum eosinophils are used as markers of airway inflammation to guide treatment with steroids, but no data are available on how reliable they are in predicting airway eosinophilia assessed bronchoscopically in these children. Objectives: To determine how Fe(NO) and sputum eosinophils predict airway eosinophilia measured in both bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and endobronchial biopsy. Methods: Twenty-seven children with moderate to severe persistent asthma attempted measurement of Fe(NO) and sputum eosinophils, followed by bronchoscopy, BAL, and endobronchial biopsy within 24 h. Main results: Significant correlations were found between eosinophils in sputum and both BAL eosinophils (n = 20, r = 0.45, p = 0.045) and Fe(NO) (n = 23, r = 0.42, p = 0.049). The relationship between Fe(NO) and BAL eosinophils was also significant with a stronger correlation (n = 24, r = 0.54, p = 0.006). The positive predictive value (PPV) for increased sputum eosinophil percentage (> 2.5%) to detect elevated eosinophils in BAL (> 1.19%) was 75%; the negative predictive value (NPV) was 63%. All patients with both increased sputum eosinophils and an elevated Fe(NO) value (> 23 ppb) had elevated eosinophils in BAL (PPV, 100%); the NPV of these two markers was 65%. Eight of nine patients without any sputum eosinophils had normal subepithelial eosinophil numbers (< 1.2%; NPV, 89%). However, the PPV of any sputum eosinophils for increased subepithelial eosinophilia was only 36.4%. Conclusions: There was moderate agreement between both Fe(NO) and sputum eosinophils and BAL eosinophils. There was good NPV, but only poor PPV for these markers for mucosal eosinophilia.",0,0
15200542,A comparison of the intubating laryngeal mask airway and the Bonfils intubation fibrescope in patients with predicted difficult airways,"Tracheal intubation with the intubating laryngeal mask airway or the Bonfils intubation fibrescope was performed in 80 patients with predicted difficult airways. Mallampati score, thyromental distance, mouth opening and mobility of the atlanto-occipital joint were used to predict difficult airways. The overall success rate, time to the first adequate lung ventilation and time taken for the successful placement of the tracheal tube were recorded, as well as a subjective assessment of the handling of the device and the incidence of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness. The median [range] time to the first adequate ventilation was significantly shorter with the intubating laryngeal mask airway than with the Bonfils intubation fibrescope (28 [6-85] s vs. 40 [23-77] s, p < 0.005). Tracheal intubation was significantly slower with the intubating laryngeal mask airway than with the Bonfils intubation fibrescope (76 [45-155] s vs. 40 [23-77] s, p < 0.0001.

Twenty-three patients scheduled for general anesthesia were studied. The tooth-blade distance was measured when optimum visibility of the glottis was obtained. The visibility was determined according to the Cormack and Lehane grading. The distance with the McCoy and the Belscope was greater than that with the Macintosh or the Miller. The visibility grade was significantly worse with the Macintosh than with the other types of laryngoscope. The results indicate that the McCoy and the Belscope provide less incidence of upper dental injuries and greater visibility than either with the Macintosh or the Miller. Furthermore, the force applied to the handle is thought to be smaller with the McCoy than with the Belscope.",0,0
20734845,[Difficult tracheal intubation: comparative assessment of the value of prognostic indices in using Macintosh and Truview laryngoscopes],"The paper describes the experience in using three predictive criteria, such as Mallampati test, Patila test, and ULBT test, to evaluate tracheal intubation and compares their predictive validity. The experience in applying Macintosh and Truview laryngoscopes to patients with predicted difficult tracheal intubation (DTI) is also depicted. A combination of three above predictive procedures is a reliable predictor of DTI (r = 0.5; p < 0.05). Therefore their combination may be recommended for clinical use to predict DTI. No significant correlation was obtained between the other criteria of DTI and the difficulties during intubation at the first attempt (p > 0.05). There was no statistical significant correlation between the used type of a laryngoscope and the rate of effective/ineffective intubations at the first attempt (r = 0.34; p > 0.05).",0,0

Study design: Prospective study. Patients and methods: Eighteen consecutive patients at risk of DI. After premedication made of hydroxyzine 2 mg x kg(-1), preoxygenation, 0.1 microg x kg(-1) sufentanil was administered (T0), then, inhalational induction was started: sevoflurane 8% in 100% O2 l x min(-1). After 1 min, sevoflurane was decreased to 5% and, if necessary, adapted to obtain an adequate depth of anaesthesia (Ramsay score > 3). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed through a Fibroxy mask. BP was measured every 2.5 min, HR, SpO2, RR were recorded. The results were analyzed by Newman-Keuls test. Results: Intubation was easily realized but it was necessary to assist ventilation in patients presenting prolonged apnea lasting more than 30 s (5 out of 9 patients who presented apnea during procedure). Intubation was quickly realized (T+ 4 +/- 3 min). Haemodynamics and saturation were not altered during procedure. Inhalatory induction using sevoflurane costs 6 10 versus 16 80 for intravenous target controlled propofol anesthesia (using only one preconditionned syringe). Conclusion: Inhalational induction with sevoflurane and fiberoptic intubation appeared easy, fast and cheap.",0,0
7292268,Cerebrospinal fluid human chorionic gonadotropin levels in normal pregnancy and choriocarcinoma,"We measured human chorionic gonadotropin levels simultaneously in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of 36 normal pregnant women and of six patients with choriocarcinoma. During normal pregnancy, human chorionic gonadotropin levels in the cerebral spinal fluid correlated well with those in the serum in both the first and third trimesters. A serum-cerebral spinal fluid human chorionic gonadotropin ratio of less than 60 has previously been reported as a sensitive diagnostic test for trophoblastic central nervous system involvement. However, we found this ratio to be less than 60 in one patient undergoing first trimester abortion and in one patient with nonmetastatic choriocarcinoma. Furthermore, two patients with documented trophoblastic cerebral metastases had serum-cerebral spinal fluid human chorionic gonadotropin ratios in excess of 60. Results of our study, thus, indicate that determination of a single serum-cerebral spinal fluid human chorionic gonadotropin ratio may not conclusively prove or exclude trophoblastic central nervous system metastases. Unless it is corroborated by other diagnostic means, a single decreased serum-cerebral spinal fluid human chorionic gonadotropin ratio is insufficient evidence to initiate multimodality treatment for presumptive central nervous system involvement.",0,0
19247763,Lighted stylet-guided intubation via the intubating laryngeal airway in a patient with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome,"Purpose: Hallermann-Streiff syndrome is a congenital syndrome associated with oculomandibulofacial abnormalities and potentially difficult airways. This case report describes the novel use of a lighted stylet-guided tracheal tube insertion through a new supraglottic airway, the intubating laryngeal airway (ILA), in a patient with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome who had anticipated difficult airway. Clinical features: A 26-year-old male with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome was scheduled for a vitrectomy. The patient had mandibulofacial dystocia with a bird-like appearance, a mouth opening of 4 cm, a receding chin, and a Mallampati class 3 examination. The surgeon requested muscle paralysis and no movement during surgery. After receiving midazolam, fentanyl and propofol, a size 3.5 ILA was inserted and lung ventilation was easy to perform. A 7.5-mm internal diameter tracheal tube was mounted on a lighted stylet with its inner rigid stylet removed. After succinylcholine administration, the lighted stylet-tracheal tube assembly was inserted via the ILA until the transillumination just vanished below the sternal notch. The lighted stylet was removed, the circuit was connected, and capnography confirmed tracheal placement of tube. The ILA was deflated and left in situ. Upon emergence from anesthesia, the tracheal tube, and subsequently the ILA, were removed without complications. Conclusions: This case presents a novel use of a lighted stylet-guided tracheal tube insertion through the ILA in a patient with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. This intubation technique can be considered in patients with difficult airways as a primary route of intubation, or as a secondary rescue strategy.",0,0
17893452,Novices ventilate and intubate quicker and safer via intubating laryngeal mask than by conventional bag-mask ventilation and laryngoscopy,"Background: Because airway management plays a key role in emergency medical care, methods other than laryngoscopic tracheal intubation (LG-TI) are being sought for inadequately experienced personnel. This study compares success rates for ventilation and intubation via the intubating laryngeal mask (ILMA-V/ILMA-TI) with those via bag-mask ventilation and laryngoscopic intubation (BM-V/LG-TI). Methods: In a prospective, randomized, crossover study, 30 final-year medical students, all with no experience in airway management, were requested to manage anesthetized patients who seemed normal on routine airway examination. Each participant was asked to intubate a total of six patients, three with each technique, in a randomly assigned order. A task not completed after two 60-s attempts was recorded as a failure, and the technique was switched. Results: The success rate with ILMA-V was significantly higher (97.8% vs. 85.6%; P < 0.05), and ventilation was established more rapidly with ILMA-V (35.6 +/- 8.0 vs. 44.3 +/- 10.8 s; P < 0.01). Intubation was successful more often with ILMA-TI (92.2% vs. 40.0%; P < 0.01). The time needed to achieve tracheal intubation was significantly shorter with ILMA-TI (45.7 +/- 14.8 vs. 89.1 +/- 23.3 s; P < 0.01). After failed LG-TI, ILMA-V was successful in all patients, and ILMA-TI was successful in 28 of 33 patients. Conversely, after failed ILMA-TI, BM-V was possible in all patients, and LG-TI was possible in 1 of 5 patients. Conclusion: Medical students were more successful with ILMA-V/ILMA-TI than with BM-V/LG-TI. ILMA-TI can be successfully used when LG-TI has failed, but not vice versa. These results suggest that training programs should extend the ILMA to conventional airway management techniques for paramedical and medical personnel with little experience in airway management.",0,0
25142764,Mallampati score and pediatric obstructive sleep apnea,"Rationale: Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common, and a delay in diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA. However, difficulty accessing PSG due to the relative shortage of sleep centers with pediatric expertise can lead to a delay in the diagnosis and management of OSA. Objectives: To assess the utility of Mallampati score (sitting and supine) in predicting the presence and severity of OSA in children. Methods: A retrospective study of 158 children from a single pediatric sleep center. All patients had a PSG and a physical examination documenting Mallampati score. The Mallampati score, tonsillar size, age, sex, and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) were analyzed. Odds ratio of having pediatric OSA (AHI > 1) with increase in Mallampati score and tonsillar size were calculated. Measurements and main results: A significant correlation was found between Mallampati score, tonsillar size, and AHI. For every point increase in the Mallampati score, the odds ratio of having OSA increased by more than 6-fold. For every point increase in tonsillar size, the odds ratio of having OSA increased by more than 2-fold. Conclusions: Mallampati score and tonsillar size are independent predictors of OSA. Oral examination including Mallampati score and tonsillar size should be considered when evaluating a patient for OSA. They can be used to prioritize children who may need PSG.",0,0
1942516,[Utility of Bullard intubating laryngoscope with a special stylet in two cases of difficult tracheal intubation],"The Bullard intubating laryngoscope is useful for cases of difficult tracheal intubation, but a skilled hand is needed to manipulate it. In two cases of difficult tracheal intubation, we used a recently improved Bullard intubating laryngoscope to which a special stylet is attached to introduce an endotracheal tube easily into the larynx. The difficulties of tracheal intubation were caused by micrognathia and trismus in one case and by restriction of neck movement and trismus due to ankylosing spondylitis in the other case. Using the Bullard intubating laryngoscope with the special stylet, intubation was done smoothly in both cases. This improved Bullard intubating laryngoscope is recommended for cases of difficult tracheal intubation.",0,0
25046065,[Comparison of rhinomanometry results with polysomnography and physical examination findings in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome],"Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effects of anterior rhinomanometry-induced nasal resistance on obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients. Patients and methods: Between May 2011 and September 2011, 100 volunteer patients (76 males, 24 females; mean age 47.6±11.6 years; range 20 to 71 years) who were admitted with complaints of snore, breathing pauses told by their partners, oversleep mood in a daytime and fatigue and diagnosed with OSAS by polysomnography with simple snore were included. Anterior rhinomanometry was applied for all patients and nasal resistance was estimated. Mallampati index and body mass index (BMI) of patients was calculated. The mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and minimum oxygen saturation values were measured. Results: There was no significant relationship between nasal resistance and AHI. However, a significant relationship between AHI and Mallampati and BMI values was observed. The AHI values increased, as the Mallampati and BMI values increased. Conclusion: Our study results show that nasal resistance has no significant effect on AHI and minimum oxygen saturation in OSAS patients.",0,0
17532537,Dual digital video-autofluorescence imaging for detection of pre-neoplastic lesions,"Aim: The incorporation of autofluorescence (AF) to white light bronchoscopy has led to improved sensitivity for the detection of pre-neoplastic lesions in the airways. However, AF has difficulty distinguishing benign epithelial changes such as bronchitis, previous biopsy, and airway fibrosis from pre-invasive lesions, which necessitates extensive biopsy. This frequently results in longer procedural time and need for additional sedation that may compromise patient safety, increase the risk of bronchospasm, and bleeding from multiple endobronchial biopsies. We postulate that dual imaging with simultaneous video and AF bronchoscopy of the tracheobronchial tree could improve the low specificity observed with AF in the detection of pre-invasive lesions, leading to targeted biopsy, good correlation with pathological diagnosis and shorter procedural time. Methods: Forty-eight patients with known or suspected of lung cancer underwent video and AF bronchoscopy, which were provided as real-time dual images with SAFE 3000 (Pentax, Tokyo) between March and August 2006. Biopsy specimens were taken from all suspicious areas with two random specimens from normal areas. Values were expressed as median and range, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Twenty-five suspicious sites were detected by dual imaging bronchoscopy, and 126 endobronchial biopsies were evaluated, of which 22 (17.5%) were graded as moderate dysplasia and worse. Sensitivity and specificity of dual imaging for the detection of high-grade dysplasia were 86% and 94%, respectively, with good correlation between bronchoscopic assessment and pathology (r=0.77, p<0.0001). However, there were three random biopsy specimens obtained from normal or abnormal sites that showed severe dysplasia in two and moderate dysplasia in one. Median time taken for airway examination was 4 min (range, 4-4.8), and 5 min (range, 4-5) for biopsy, giving a total procedural time of 9 min (range, 8-10). There were no procedure-related complications noted. Conclusion: Dual imaging that allows simultaneous real-time assessment of the lesion with video and AF bronchoscopy not only achieves satisfactory sensitivity for the detection of pre-neoplastic lesions, importantly it improves specificity by allowing targeted biopsy, which has led to a marked decrease in procedural time and better patient safety.",0,0
23810609,Airway management in obese patients,"The well-known difficulties in airway management in obese patients are caused by obesity-related airways and respiratory changes. Anesthesiologists confront a number of troubles, including rapid oxygen desaturation, difficulty with laryngoscopy/intubation and mask ventilation, and increased susceptibility to the respiratory depressant effects of anesthetic drugs. Preoperative assessment of the airways in the obese should include examination of specific predictors of difficult mask ventilation other than those for difficult intubation. Difficulties in airway management are decreased after providing optimal preoxygenation and positioning (""ramped""). Other strategies may include availability of alternative airway management devices, including new video laryngoscopes that significantly improve the visualization of the larynx and thereby facilitate intubation. If awake intubation is mandatory, it may be performed with fibrobronchoscope after providing an adequate topical anesthesia and sedation with short-acting drugs, such as remifentanil. Succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction might be replaced by rocuronium where sugammadex is available for reversal. A complete reversal of neuromuscular block, measured by train-of-four monitoring, should be obtained before extubation, which requires a fully awake patient in the same position with airway equipment used for intubation.",0,0
22240714,The Kushida Index as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome,"Objectives: To test the validity of the Kushida Index for screening for sleep apnoea in a West of Scotland adult population. Methods: Specific intra-oral measurements and respiratory polysomnography were carried out on 71 patients in this prospective study. The intra-oral measurements were applied to the Kushida formula to obtain a value for the Kushida Index. This value was compared to the diagnosis obtained using polysomnography in the conventional manner. Results: The sensitivity of the Kushida Index in this present study was 68% (95% CI 50-81) and the specificity was 71% (95% CI 52-84). The positive predictive value was 71% and the negative predictive value was 67%. The Mallampati score, Epworth sleepiness score and enlargement of the tongue, soft palate or tonsils were not statistically significantly related to a diagnosis of sleep apnoea (p >0.05). Conclusion: With the limited sensitivity and specificity of the Kushida Index demonstrated in this study, this test cannot be recommended as a screening tool for sleep apnoea in a West of Scotland population.",0,0
18292672,Airway changes during labor and delivery,"Background: There are no prospective studies that evaluated airway changes during labor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate airway changes in women undergoing labor and delivery. Methods: Two studies were undertaken to evaluate airway changes during labor. The first study used the conventional Samsoon modification of the Mallampati airway class. The airway was photographed at the onset and the end of labor. Women with class 4 airways were excluded from initial participation. In the second study, upper airway volumes were measured using acoustic reflectometry at the onset and the conclusion of labor. Acoustic reflectometry software computed the values for the components of upper airway, oral volume, and pharyngeal volume. Results: In study 1 (n = 61), there was a significant increase in airway class from prelabor to postlabor (P < 0.001). The airway increased one grade higher in 20 (33%) and two grades higher in 3 (5%) after labor. At the end of labor, there were 8 parturients with airway class 4 (P < 0.01) and 30 parturients with airway class 3 or class 4 (P < 0.001). In study 2 (n = 21), there were significant decreases in oral volume (n = 21; P < 0.05), and pharyngeal area (P < 0.05) and volume (P < 0.001) after labor and delivery. No correlation was observed between airway changes during labor and duration of labor, or fluids administered during labor in either study. Conclusion: Airways can change during labor. Therefore, a careful airway evaluation is essential just before administering anesthesia during labor rather than obtaining this information from prelabor data.",0,0
18420866,Poor visualization during direct laryngoscopy and high upper lip bite test score are predictors of difficult intubation with the GlideScope videolaryngoscope,"Background: The GlideScope videolaryngoscope allows equal or superior glottic visualization compared with direct laryngoscopy, but predictive features for difficult GlideScope intubation have not been identified. We undertook this prospective study to identify patient characteristics associated with difficult GlideScope intubation. Methods: Demographic and morphometric factors were recorded preoperatively for 400 patients undergoing anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. After induction, direct laryngoscopy was performed in all patients to assess the Cormack and Lehane grade of glottic visualization followed by GlideScope intubation. The number of attempts and time needed for intubation were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the characteristics associated with difficult GlideScope intubation. Results: Intubation required 1, 2, and 3 attempts in 342, 48, and 9 participants, respectively, with one failure. Mean time for intubation was 21 +/- 14 s. After univariate analysis, the following characteristics were significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with longer time to intubate and/or multiple attempts: older age, male sex, history of snoring, high Mallampati class, small mouth opening, short sternothyroid and manubriomental distances, large neck circumference, high upper lip bite test score, and high Cormack and Lehane grade during direct laryngoscopy. However, after introducing these variables in nominal logistic and proportional hazard multiple regression models, only high Cormack and Lehane grade during direct laryngoscopy, high upper lip bite test score, and short sternothyroid distance were significantly associated with multiple attempts or lengthier intubations. Conclusion: Despite a high success rate, intubation with the GlideScope is likely to be more challenging in patients with high Cormack and Lehane grade during direct laryngoscopy, high upper lip bite test score, or short sternothyroid distance.",0,0
1824555,Management of the difficult adult airway. With special emphasis on awake tracheal intubation,"Difficulty in managing the airway is the single most important cause of major anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Successful management of a difficult airway begins with recognizing the potential problem. All patients should be examined for their ability to open their mouth widely and for the structures visible upon mouth opening, the size of the mandibular space, and ability to assume the sniff position. If there is a good possibility that intubation and/or ventilation by mask will be difficult, then the airway should be secured while the patient is still awake. In order for an awake intubation to be successful, it is absolutely essential that the patient be properly prepared; otherwise, the anesthesiologist will simply fulfill a self-defeating prophecy. Once the patient is properly prepared, it is likely that any one of a number of intubation techniques will be successful. If the patient is already anesthetized and/or paralyzed and intubation is found to be difficult, many repeated attempts at intubation should be avoided because progressive development of laryngeal edema and hemorrhage will develop and the ability to ventilate the lungs via mask consequently may be lost. After several attempts at intubation, it may be best to awaken the patient, do a semielective tracheostomy, or proceed with the case using mask ventilation. In the event that the ability to ventilate via mask is lost and the patient's lungs still cannot be ventilated, TTJV should be instituted immediately. Tracheal extubation of a patient with a difficult airway over a jet stylet permits a controlled, gradual, and reversible (in that ventilation and reintubation is possible at any time) withdrawal from the airway. Significant advances in the management of the difficult airway have occurred in recent years. Eighty percent of the 127 references in this article were published after 1985. However, there is much more to learn with regard to recognition of the difficult airway, preparation of the patient for an awake intubation, new techniques of endotracheal intubation, and establishment of gas exchange in patients who cannot be intubated or ventilated by mask. As the anesthesiologist's ability to manage the difficult airway significantly improves, respiratory-related morbidity and mortality will decrease.",0,0
19462791,[Risk management of anesthesia for head and neck surgery],"Control of the airway is fundamental for the safe anesthetic practice of head and neck surgery and careful assessment of airway must be undertaken preoperatively. Safe tracheal intubation method should be decided after the airway assessment. Special considerations are necessary for laser surgery, use of a nerve stimulator, and selecting the proper size and type of endotracheal tubes. Emergency anesthesia for neck and head surgery is most difficult. Experienced personnel and several kinds of devices for securing the airway should be gathered in the operating room before induction of anesthesia.",0,0
10591345,Clinical predictors of obstructive sleep apnea,"Objective: To identify physical findings that can be standardized to predict the presence and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Study design: One hundred seventy-two patients who answered questionnaires with responses that suggested they might have OSA were included in this prospective study. Methods: All patients underwent a physical examination and polysomnography. The physical examination included the measurement of four parameters used by anesthesiologists to identify patients likely to have difficult intubation to determine if these same parameters predict OSA. We recorded modified Mallampati grade (MMP), tonsil size, and body mass index (BMI) and measured thyroid-mental distance (TMD) and hyoid-mental distance (HMD) in the study population. Results: When the physical findings were correlated singly with the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), we found that MMP (P < .001), tonsil size grading (P = .008), and BMI (P = .003) were reliable predictors of OSA. A greater correlation with OSA emerged when an ""OSA score"" was formulated by factoring the MMP, tonsil grade, and BMI grade (RDI = 7.816 x MMP + 3.988 x Tonsil Size + 4.675 x BMI - 7.544). A high score was not only predictive of OSA but also correlated well with OSA severity. Neither HMD nor TMD correlated with the severity of RDI. Conclusions: An OSA score may help identify those patients who should have a full sleep evaluation.",0,0
17448065,Comparison of the Levitan FPS Scope and the single-use bougie for simulated difficult intubation in anaesthetised patients,"A randomised cross-over study was performed in 34 patients with no evidence of airway difficulties, following induction of general anaesthesia, to compare the efficacy of the Levitan FPS scope (LFPS) and the single-use bougie for tracheal intubation during simulated grade IIIa laryngoscopy. Success rates for intratracheal placement of the device, and the time required for insertion and tracheal intubation were recorded. Both devices were equally successful (31/34 for the LFPS vs 29/34 for the bougie) for insertion into the glottis. The mean insertion time for the LFPS was statistically longer than that for the bougie (4.4-12.5 s) but this difference was not clinically relevant. Intubation times were similar between the two devices. Major problems hindering successful intubation using the LFPS were the presence of a narrow epiglottic-pharyngeal wall space and copious secretions. An inability to maintain the desired shape was the principal cause of failure with the bougie.",0,0
21277060,Improvement in respiration and craniofacial changes associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery,"Purpose: To study weight loss, craniofacial changes, and respiratory quality among obese patients before and after bariatric surgery. Material and methods: The obese group comprised 17 male and female patients aged between 18 and 60 years with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m(2) who were scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery. All patients were evaluated in the preoperative period and at least 4 months following surgery by means of clinical, physical, anthropometric, facial, nasal, oral, and oropharyngeal examinations as well as radiographic examinations of the facial profile with individual cephalometric analysis. Patients also completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale. The control group underwent the same examinations and included 10 male and female volunteers with BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m(2), good dental occlusion, harmonious facial features, and no history of respiratory or sleep disorders. Results: There were significant reductions in weight, BMI, and neck circumference as well as an improvement in Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scores in the obese group after bariatric surgery (P < .05). There was a reduction in craniocervical length, increase in velopharyngeal air space, and reduction in the distance between the hyoid bone and mentum following weight loss. The Mallampati Scale revealed a significant inversion of palate position categories between evaluations. Conclusions: There was improvement in respiratory quality and craniofacial changes caused by weight loss, especially in soft tissues around the upper air space, as well as craniocervical length and position of the hyoid bone.",0,0
18179746,Effects of nanoparticles on lung physiology in the presence or absence of antigen,"Ambient particulate matter (PM) exacerbates allergic airway diseases. Our previous study showed that diesel exhaust particles, the main constituents in urban PM, enhance airway hyperresponsivness in mice. In addition, health effects of PM with a diameter of less than 100 nm, called nanoparticles, have been reported, and we have also demonstrated that carbon nanoparticles exacerbate antigen-related airway inflammation. The present study investigates the effects of pulmonary exposure to two sizes of carbon nanoparticles on lung physiology and lung expression of Muc5ac in the presence or absence of antigen in mice. Nanoparticles alone or ovalbumin (OVA) alone moderately enhanced cholinergic airway reactivity, as assessed by total respiratory system resistance (R) and Newtonian resistance (Rn). In the nanoparticle + OVA groups, all the parameters for lung responsiveness, such as R, compliance, elastance, Rn, tissue damping, and tissue elastance, were worse than those in the vehicle group, the corresponding nanoparticle groups or the OVA group. The lung mRNA level for Muc5ac was significantly higher in the OVA group than in the vehicle group, and further increased in the nanoparticle + OVA groups than in the OVA or the nanoparticle groups. These data suggest that carbon nanoparticles can enhance lung hyperresponsiveness, especially in the presence of antigen. The effects may be mediated, at least partly, through the enhanced lung expression of Muc5ac.",0,0
21219809,Predictive factors of difficult airway with known assessment scales,"Background: difficult intubation is defined as the need for more than three attempts for intubation or more than 10 min to accomplish it, a situation that occurs in 1.5-8% of general anesthetic procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive factors of difficult airway with known assessment scales. Methods: in a cross-sectional study conducted in 184 patients during the pre-anesthetic evaluation, we assessed the oral opening, viewing pharyngeal structures (Mallampati scale), condition of teeth, anatomic chin and neck, head extension and neck flexion (normal or limited), thyromental distance (Patil-Aldreti test) and the presence of obesity. We performed a calculation of sensitivity (S), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) using contingency tables. Results: we found that grades III and IV Mallapati (84%) and limited extension and flexion of the head and neck (99%) showed a high specificity for predicting difficult intubation. Other factors associated with difficult intubation were related to micrognathia, limited mouth opening and teeth with anatomic abnormalities. Conclusions: it is essential to take the necessary time to assess the airway with the greatest number of criteria predictive of difficult intubation for the person performing the procedure in order to take the necessary steps to face difficulties in this technique.",0,1
23997480,Evaluation of inter incisal mouth opening for airway maintenance in oral submucous fibrosis,"Purpose: Determination of difficult airway maintenance preoperatively holds a great significance in different intubation techniques and also surgical exploration of airway. No data is available for relation of airway maintenance and preoperative interincisal mouth opening in oral submucous fibrosis patients. Methods: 20 oral submucous fibrosis patients were evaluated pre operatively for general anaesthesia. Direct nasotracheal intubation, fiberoptic laryngoscopy guided intubation or awake blind nasal intubation technique, or combination of above techniques were used. Results: Mean pre operative inter incisal mouth opening for direct nasotracheal intubation (nine patients) is 15.44 mm, fiberoptic guided laryngoscopy (six patients) is 9.0 mm and blind nasal intubation (five patients) is 5.2 mm.

18022753,Use of the intubating laryngeal mask airway in emergency pre-hospital difficult intubation,"Aim of the study: While several techniques are used for the management of difficult intubation (DI) in planned conditions in the operating theatre, they are not always suitable or usable in pre-hospital emergencies. We decided to assess the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) after failure of tracheal intubation (TI) under direct laryngoscopy. Material and methods: After emergency physicians of the mobile intensive care unit were trained (theory and training on manikin) in using the ILMA (Fastrach), prospective data were collected after each use from March 2002 to December 2005. Data included patient's age, clinical status, number of direct laryngoscopies before using ILMA, Cormack and Lehane grade, subjective and objective evaluation of ease of ILMA insertion and TI (analogue scale from 1 to 10, attempts required, failure rate). Results: Over 46 months, the ILMA was used 45 times (24: cardio-respiratory arrest, 21: anaesthesia with rapid sequence induction). Median age was 59 years [range 20-86]. The number of direct laryngoscopy attempts was 3 [0-4] (76% Cormack 4). The success of ILMA insertion and TI were 96 and 91%, respectively. Conclusion: Emergency physicians were satisfied with using the ILMA. It allowed TI in 91% of cases of DI. The ILMA can be recommended to be included in the algorithm of DI in pre-hospital emergencies after initial training.",0,0

15957728,An unexpectedly difficult intubation following repeated endoscopy,A 67-year-old man required an urgent laparotomy for a bleeding gastric ulcer. He had undergone three upper gastrointestinal endoscopies over five days since admission to hospital.

20083781,Accuracy and safety of tracheoscopy for infants in a tertiary care clinic,"Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of office-based tracheoscopy when combined with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFLT). Flexible laryngoscopy on infants is routinely performed by otolaryngologists in the clinic. The addition of tracheoscopy may improve overall airway assessment but is rarely performed due to the suspected risk of airway compromise. Design: A 6-year retrospective medical record review. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Patients: Thirty-one infants younger than 1 year with complete data from preoperative FFLT and microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB) were examined. Main outcome measures: Results from 241 MLB procedures were reviewed. Results: Laryngomalacia (LM) and tracheomalacia (TM) were identified more often by FFLT than by MLB. In particular, the detection rate for LM and TM by MLB, as seen preoperatively by FFLT, was 79% and 61%, respectively. Compared with FFLT, MLB accurately diagnosed the severity of LM and TM only 55% and 65%, respectively, of the time. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed synchronous airway lesions in 62% of infants with LM, while MLB discovered synchronous airway lesions in 54%. Static airway lesions were more frequently diagnosed with MLB. No respiratory events occurred during FFLT. Conclusions: In an appropriate patient, FFLT is a safe and effective diagnostic tool for common infant tracheal and laryngeal abnormalities. Detection and characterization of dynamic airway lesions is better achieved by FFLT than by MLB.",0,0
24949304,"Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy: Extended mallampati score versus the MMT, ULBT and RHTMD","Background: Preoperative using of anatomical landmarks detects potentially difficult laryngoscopies. The main object of the present study was to evaluate the predictive power of Extended Mallampati Score (EMS) in comparison with modified Mallampati test (MMT), the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD) and the Upper-Lip-Bite test (ULBT) in isolation and combination. Materials and methods: Four hundred seventy sixadult patients who candidate for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were included in this study and evaluated based of all four factors before surgery. This study was randomized prospective double - blind. After that, laryngoscopy was performed by an anesthesiologist who didn't involve in preoperative airway assessment and graded based on Cormack and Lehane's classification. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) (AUC) for each score. Results: The AUCof the ROC was significantly more for the ULBT (AUC = 0.820, P = 0.049) and RHTMD score (AUC = 0.845, P = 0.033) than the EMS (AUC = 0.703). This variable was significantly higher for the EMS compared with MMT (0.703 vs. 0.569, P = 0.046 respectively). There was no significant difference between the AUC of the ROC for the ULBT and the RHTMD score (P = 0.685). The optimalcut-off point for the RHTMD for predicting difficult laryngoscopy was 29.3. Conclusion: EMS predicted difficult laryngoscopy better than MMT while both ULBT and RHTMD had more power than EMS and MMT in this regard. ULBT and RHTMD had similar predictive value for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in general population.",1,1
16557027,Subtle immunodeficiency in severe asthma: IgA and IgG2 correlate with lung function and symptoms,"Background: Atopy, increased serum IgE and eosinophilic airway inflammation are common in asthma and may indicate aberrant immune responses, but the cause(s) are unknown. It was hypothesized that differences in serum immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) and secretory IgA (sIgA) would exist between subjects with asthma of varying severity and normal subjects, and the levels would correlate with lung function, symptoms and airway inflammation. Methods: Serum IgG, IgA, IgE and IgM, IgG subclasses and FLC, and bronchoalveolar lavage sIgA were evaluated from 15 normal subjects, 9 mild and 22 severe asthmatics with similar atopic status. Asthma symptoms were obtained by questionnaire, and airway inflammation was assessed by immunostaining for five inflammatory cell types. Results: Immunoglobulin levels in all groups were generally within the normal range. However, IgA and IgG were lower in severe asthmatics than normal subjects (overall p = 0.006 and 0.02, respectively). IgA, but not IgG, correlated with lung function and asthma symptoms (r-values >0.58; p-values <0.009). Although similar among the groups, higher sIgA and IgG(2) also positively correlated with lung function and negatively with asthma symptoms (r-values >0.63; p-values <0.009). IgA and IgG/IgG(1) positively correlated with tissue mast cells. Conclusions: Subtle alterations in IgA- and IgG(2)-mediated responses in asthma may be disease-related. As their levels are generally normal, it is possible that the quality/repertoire of immune protection provided by these isotypes, perhaps against carbohydrate epitopes, may be altered in asthma.",0,0
22095839,Endoscopic anterior cricoid split with balloon dilation in infants with failed extubation,"Subglottic injury (SGI) is a known complication of prolonged intubation in neonates and infants and can lead to failed extubation. SGI is a spectrum that includes mucosal edema, ulceration, granulation perichondritis, and mature scar formation. Although medical management aimed at treating mucosal edema and extraesophageal reflux is successful in treating a majority of patients, some require surgical intervention to successfully achieve extubation. The surgical options for these patients include tracheostomy, open anterior cricoid split (ACS), and laryngotracheal reconstruction with cartilage grafting. Open ACS is performed through an external incision requiring placement of a drain for a few days. Extubation success rates in the 70% to 80% range have been widely reported. In this article we describe an endoscopic technique for ACS, in which after an endoscopic airway assessment confirms isolated SGI, the cricoid cartilage is divided transluminally with cold steel. Balloon dilation (BD) is then performed with an appropriately sized angiography balloon. We describe preliminary results in which two of three patients were successfully extubated after endoscopic ACS with BD. We believe that this novel technique is a promising alternative to open ACS with similar indications. In addition to the avoidance of a skin incision, endoscopic ACS with BD may enable extubation with comparably shorter lengths of postprocedure intubation than open ACS. Larger series will be required to further establish outcomes of this procedure, including success and complication rates.",0,0
21959391,Tracheobronchial anomalies in syndromic craniosynostosis with 3-dimensional CT image and bronchoscopy,"Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis have many problems involving the upper airway, laryngotracheal airway, and tracheobronchial tree. Evaluation of tracheobronchial disorders in syndromic craniosynostosis is very important for accurately diagnosing these problems. We have used three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) imaging of the tracheobronchial tree (three-dimensional tracheal CT imaging) since a multidetector CT was installed in our hospital in 2004. In this study, we assessed the configuration of the tracheobronchial system using three-dimensional tracheal CT imaging and bronchoscopy.During the period from 2004 to 2009, 48 patients with syndromic craniosynostosis underwent surgery at our hospital. Of those, 16 patients required tracheostomy. These syndromic craniosynostosis cases were examined with three-dimensional tracheal CT imaging and bronchoscopy. All CT scans were performed on a multidetector CT (120 kV, 22-120 mA, 0.5 s/slice, 1-mm slice; Aquilion; Toshiba Co, Tokyo, Japan) without respiratory suppression.All 16 study patients presented with severe stenosis of the upper airway on bronchoscopic examination. Seven were confirmed to have abnormalities by both bronchoscopy and three-dimensional tracheal CT imaging. Four were confirmed to have abnormalities on either bronchoscopy or three-dimensional tracheal CT imaging, whereas 5 patients were apparently free of abnormalities as determined by both modalities.In conclusion, it was possible to accurately assess the configuration of the tracheobronchial system using both three-dimensional tracheal CT imaging and bronchoscopy. Our results suggest these examinations to be very useful for assessing the optimal timing of decannulation and respiratory function prognosis.",0,0
11558740,A study of an electrodiagnostic technique for the evaluation of equine recurrent laryngeal neuropathy,"The electrodiagnostic measurement of the thoracolaryngeal reflex (TLR) ('slap test') latency was compared to 5 other diagnostic techniques used for evaluation of laryngeal function, namely laryngeal muscle palpation, resting and immediately postexercise endoscopic examinations, and palpable and endoscopic responses to the TLR. Compared to resting endoscopy, the electrodiagnostic measurement of TLR latency was not found to be an accurate test for the evaluation of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN), nor was laryngeal muscle palpation or the endoscopic response to the TLR. Twenty-five (71%) of 35 Clydesdale horses examined were affected by RLN; 16 (46%) had mild, 5 (14%) moderate, 3 (9%) severe hemiparesis and 1 (3%) had total laryngeal paralysis. Within these 35 horses, physical traits such as height or neck length did not correlate with the incidence or severity of RLN. Ten control ponies showed no evidence of abnormal laryngeal function.",0,0
22002341,Use of bronchial blockers: a retrospective review of 302 cases,"The purpose of this retrospective review is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the bronchial blockers (BBs) used in thoracic anesthesia. We enrolled 302 patients who had a BB placed to achieve one-lung ventilation (OLV). Variables recorded from the anesthetic record included type of device used, type and side of surgery, specific indications for OLV, Mallampati score, route of intubation, and complications related to the use of BBs. The BBs used include the Arndt Wire-guided, Univent, Cohen Flexi-tip, Fogarty catheter, and Fuji. The majority of BBs placed were Arndt (n = 156) or Univent (n = 131). BBs were used significantly more often in thoracoscopic procedures than in thoracotomies (P < 0.01). Of the 251 patients, 216 (86%) had a Mallampati score of I/II and 35 (14%) had a score of III/IV. There were no identified complications related to BBs. In summary, BBs can be safely used to achieve OLV and offer advantages for OLV in specific situations.",0,0
25695842,A novel device for measurement of subglottic stenosis in 3 dimensions during suspension laryngoscopy,"Importance: A challenge in treating subglottic stenosis is assessment of airway caliber before and after management. At present, surgeons lack a simple, efficient, and precise method of measuring subglottic stenosis intraoperatively. We present a novel, easily reproducible tool for measurement of the diameter, location, and length of subglottic stenosis during suspension laryngoscopy. Methods and observations: A set of 5 Kirschner wires (30-cm length and 1.6-mm diameter) were bent 90° at both ends to produce a series of 10 short ends designed to measure airway diameter (0.3- to 2.1-cm length with 2-mm intervals). Short, bent ends of the measuring sticks were designed to measure airway diameter. Hash marks at 2-mm intervals were created along the long axis of the measuring sticks to measure subglottic stenosis length and location relative to the vocal cords. The measuring stick was tested in 10 adult patients undergoing suspension microlaryngoscopy for endoscopic treatment of subglottic stenosis between September 2012 and July 2013. The accuracy of the measuring stick was evaluated using an airway phantom. The measuring stick enabled easy and precise quantification of subglottic stenosis diameter (82.5% agreement with reference; interobserver agreement, r = 0.995; P < .001), length (72.5%; r = 0.995; P < .001) and location during suspension laryngoscopy. Conclusions and relevance: The measuring stick is inexpensive and simple to construct. It allows for safe, accurate, and practical measurement of subglottic stenosis diameter, length, and location during suspension laryngoscopy.",0,0
7598242,Endotracheal tube location verified reliably by cuff palpation,"To verify a safe location of the endotracheal tube (ETT), palpation of the ETT at the sternal notch is a time-honored technique: After anesthetic induction and confirmation of orotracheal intubation, the patient's head is placed in a neutral position. The ETT is withdrawn or advanced while gentle, repetitive pressure is applied with the fingers at the level of the suprasternal notch. Simultaneously, the pilot balloon is held in the other hand. When the balloon distends from the pressure applied at the notch, the ETT is secured. We tested the efficacy of this technique in men and women who underwent general anesthesia. After the ETT was secured, the distance (in cm) from its tip to the upper incisors, that is, the length of ETT inserted, was measured to confirm its location relative to the carina. The study population consisted of 44 women and 38 men (n = 82) who ranged in age from 16 to 85 yr and in ASA physical status from I to IV. The size of the ETT tube for women ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 and for men, 7.0 to 8.5. Average distance from the tip of the ETT to teeth in women was 20.2 cm (range, 17-23) and in men 21.9 cm (range, 19-25). Average distance to the carina in women was 3 cm (range, 2-5) and in men 3.4 cm (range, 2-6). In this study, palpation of the ETT cuff effectively confirmed ETT location. The technique, which should not be used to verify endotracheal rather than bronchial intubation, should decrease the risk of bronchial intubation or impingement on the carina.",0,0
21982168,The use of the GlideScope® for tracheal intubation in patients with halo vest,"Objective: GlideScope® provides better laryngoscopic view and is advantageous in tracheal intubation in ankylosing spondylitis patients with difficult airway. Methods: This study was performed to investigate the use of the GlideScope® for tracheal intubation in 15 patients wearing halo vests scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Preoperative airway assessments were evaluated to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. Before intubation, all patients were given a modified Cormack and Lehane (MCLS) grade and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score by the intubating anesthesiologist having resorted to direct laryngoscopy (DL) with a Macintosh Size 3 blade depiction. Then intubation with the GlideScope® was performed, during which the larynx was inspected and given another MCLS grade and POGO score. Results: Fourteen of the 15 patients had MCLS Grade III or IV by direct Macintosh laryngoscopy and were considered to have a difficult laryngoscopy. Nasal tracheal intubation by the GlideScope® was successful on all occasions. The GlideScope® improved the MCLS grade and POGO score in all patients who had put on a halo vest as compared with those on DL (p<0.01). The GlideScope® also provided a better laryngoscopic view than that by a DL. All of the patients who wore halo vests and presented with suspected difficult airways could be intubated successfully with the GlideScope®. Conclusion: The use of the GlideScope® for tracheal intubation could be an alternative option in patients with a difficult airway, whose surgery was circumscribed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation.",0,0
6508165,Safe lateral wall cuff pressure to prevent aspiration,"Although the incidence of cuff induced tracheal damage has been considerably reduced by judicious use of tracheal tubes with large-volume, low-pressure cuffs, aspiration continues to be a major problem. A study was conducted to determine the maximum hydrostatic pressure that can be produced by a column of liquid above the tracheal cuff. The vertical and horizontal distance between the upper central incisor teeth and suprasternal notch was measured in 200 supine adult subjects. The maximum vertical and horizontal distance between the upper central incisor teeth and suprasternal notch was 9 cm and 21 cm respectively. The implication of these findings are discussed and it is suggested that a fixed intracuff pressure in the range of 2.5 to 3kPa should be used to obtain an optimal tracheal seal.",0,0
19095862,Airway scope and StyletScope for tracheal intubation in a simulated difficult airway,"Background: Direct laryngoscopy is difficult when the cervical spine is immobilized. The Airway Scope and StyletScope are new laryngoscopes designed to facilitate intubation under these circumstances. Thus, in patients wearing a rigid cervical collar to simulate a difficult airway, we tested the hypothesis that the intubation success rates of the Airway Scope and StyletScope are similar, but that intubation with Airway Scope is faster. Methods: Adult patients requiring tracheal intubation as part of anesthesia were enrolled. After anesthesia induction and muscle relaxation, patients' necks were stabilized with a rigid Philadelphia collar and patients were randomly assigned to tracheal intubation with Airway Scope (n = 50) or StyletScope (n = 50). Overall intubation success rate, time required for intubation, the number of attempts required for successful intubation, and airway complications related to intubation were recorded. Results: Overall intubation success rates were 98% with Airway Scope and 96% with StyletScope. Intubation was 19 s faster with Airway Scope (32[8] s; mean) versus StyletScope (51[29] s). The number of required intubation attempts was similar with each device: 26/18/5 (first/second/third attempt) for Airway Scope versus 26/17/5 for StyletScope. The incidence of mucosal trauma and lip injury was similar, except esophageal intubation occurred only with StyletScope (n = 6); neither dental injury nor hypoxia occurred. Conclusions: Both the Airway Scope and StyletScope offer high success rates in a simulated difficult airway achieved by a rigid collar. However, the Airway Scope is faster and less likely to cause esophageal intubation.",0,0
17236388,Awake intubation using fast-track laryngeal mask airway as an alternative to fiberoptic bronchoscopy: a case report,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pose a unique challenge to the anesthetist. The manifestations of RA may include cervical spine instability, limited range of motion, and temperomandibular joint involvement limiting mouth opening. Therefore, securing the airway while maintaining the head and neck in a neutral position is of particular concern to the anesthetist. While this is most commonly accomplished using an awake fiberoptic technique, the following case is presented as a safe and efficient initial alternative to the primary use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the appropriate patient population.",0,0
20802806,Do Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea have an Increased Risk of Desaturation During Induction of Anesthesia for Weight Loss Surgery?,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor to develop perioperative complications during weight loss surgery, but the mechanisms are unclear. It is possible, that patients with OSA have a higher incidence of desaturation during induction of anesthesia. Methods: We enrolled 100 morbidly obese (body mass index: 53+/-10) adult patients undergoing open bariatric surgery in a prospective study. At least 1 h before induction of anesthesia, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) was measured by an oximetry finger probe in the sitting and supine positions, and Mallampati score was taken. Oxygen saturation was recorded also during induction of anesthesia, and nadir values were analyzed, and the STOP-BANG questionnaire was applied. Results: Thirty-six patients presented with clinical suspicion of OSA. Body weight predicted oxygen saturation in the supine and sitting position, prior to induction of anesthesia. Nadir oxygen saturation during induction of anesthesia was considerably higher in patients with clinical suspicion of OSA, a significant finding that persisted as a trend after correction for age, gender and BMI. The Mallampati score was an independent predictor of OSA, even in morbidly obese patients scheduled for weight loss surgery. Conclusions: Morbidly obese patients presenting for weight loss surgery have a significant risk to desaturate during induction of anesthesia. A history of OSA does not independently increase the risk of desaturation during induction of anesthesia, if the appropriate precautions are being taken.",0,0
25948913,Anesthetic management of post-burn contracture chest with microstomia: Regional nerve blocks to aid in intubation,"This case report exemplifies the anesthetic technique of blocking bilateral infraorbital and mental nerves for release of contractures of mouth. A 30 year old female patient of post-acid burn contractures of chest wall and mouth was scheduled for contracture release and skin grafting. Airway assessment revealed severe restriction of mouth opening with limited restriction of neck movements. Contracture release of mouth conducted by blocking bilateral infraorbital and mental nerves, which facilitated intubation easily. This case report highlights the practical advantage of nerve blocks for release of contracture mouth, in case of anticipated difficult airway, over other conventional methods.",0,0
17078954,A review of traumatic airway injuries: potential implications for airway assessment and management,"Background: Obtaining a patent airway can be difficult in patients with traumatic airway injuries (TAI). There is a paucity of data available about the incidence of airway compromise and techniques used in these patients. Methods: Charts review of all patients with TAI treated in a Regional Trauma Center from July 1989 to June 2005. Results: One hundred and four patients were identified as TAI in the study period (incidence of 0.4% for blunt and 4.5% for penetrating trauma). Sixty-eighty patients were victims of penetrating trauma (ISS: 24+/-10; mortality: 16%). Thirty-six patients were blunt trauma victims (ISS: 33+/-16; mortality: 36%). Overall, 65% of the patients received a definitive airway (DA) in the pre-hospital setting or at the initial hospital assessment. Alternative techniques for obtaining DA including wound tracheal tube, surgical airway and intubation under fiberoptic bronchoscopy were used in 30% of the patients. Among 24 deaths, 10 were considered primarily due to the airway injury. Twelve patients presented with thoracic TAI with nine deaths in this subgroup. Conclusions: Overall, the incidence of TAI is low. Blunt trauma TAI is less common, and these patients have a different clinical presentation, higher ISS and mortality than the penetrating TAI group. Early assessment of airways is crucial and DA was required in 2/3 of the patients with TAI. Lower airway injuries have higher mortality than upper airway injuries. Even though most patients died as a result of other injuries, causative factors of death included difficulty in obtaining DA and ventilation/oxygenation problems.",0,0
8653182,Episodic paroxysmal laryngospasm: voice and pulmonary function assessment and management,"Episodic paroxysmal laryngospasm (EPL) is a sign of laryngeal dysfunction, often without a specific organic etiology, which can masquerade as asthma, vocal fold paralysis, or a functional voice disorder. The intermittent respiratory distress of EPL may precipitate an apparent upper airway obstructive emergency, resulting in unnecessary endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or tracheostomy. During 27 months, seven women and three men, age 30-76 years, were assessed by a high diagnostic index of suspicion, an intensive history including psychosocial factors, physical examination of the airways, provocative asthma testing, and swallowing studies. Videolaryngoscopy, stroboscopy, and pulmonary flow-volume loop testing were definitive. The classic appearance was paradoxic inspiratory adduction of the anterior vocal folds with a posterior diamond-shaped glottic gap. During an attack of stridor or wheezing, attenuation of the inspiratory flow rate as depicted by the flow-volume loop suggested partial extrathoracic upper airway obstruction. Swallowing evaluation by videolaryngoscopy and videosophagography may uncover gastroesophageal reflux disease. Hallmarks of management include patient and family education by observation of laryngoscopic videos, a specific speech therapy program, psychotherapy, and medical treatment of associated disorders. Electromyography may become a valuable future adjunct. Unlike laryngeal dystonia, patients with EPL do not benefit from botulinum toxin type A.",0,0
23348979,Early identification of patients at risk for difficult intubation in the intensive care unit: development and validation of the MACOCHA score in a multicenter cohort study,"Rationale: Difficult intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a challenging issue. Objectives: To develop and validate a simplified score for identifying patients with difficult intubation in the ICU and to report related complications. Methods: Data collected in a prospective multicenter study from 1,000 consecutive intubations from 42 ICUs were used to develop a simplified score of difficult intubation, which was then validated externally in 400 consecutive intubation procedures from 18 other ICUs and internally by bootstrap on 1,000 iterations. Measurements and main results: In multivariate analysis, the main predictors of difficult intubation (incidence = 11.3%) were related to patient (Mallampati score III or IV, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, reduced mobility of cervical spine, limited mouth opening); pathology (severe hypoxia, coma); and operator (nonanesthesiologist). From the β parameter, a seven-item simplified score (MACOCHA score) was built, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.94). In the validation cohort (prevalence of difficult intubation = 8%), the AUC was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76-0.96), with a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 89%, a negative predictive value of 98%, and a positive predictive value of 36%. After internal validation by bootstrap, the AUC was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.93). Severe life-threatening events (severe hypoxia, collapse, cardiac arrest, or death) occurred in 38% of the 1,000 cases. Patients with difficult intubation (n = 113) had significantly higher severe life-threatening complications than those who had a nondifficult intubation (51% vs. 36%; P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Difficult intubation in the ICU is strongly associated with severe life-threatening complications. A simple score including seven clinical items discriminates difficult and nondifficult intubation in the ICU. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01532063).",0,0
22111369,[Case of unexpected difficult intubation caused by asymptomatic congenital laryngeal web],"We report a case of unexpected difficult intubation in a patient with an asymptomatic congenital laryngeal web. A 44-year-old female with left ovarian tumor and endometrial polyp was scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy under general anesthesia. With aid of laryngoscopy using Macintosh laryngoscope, we attempted to place a tracheal tube (ID 7.5 mm and 7.0 mm), but could not perform instrumentation because of the resistance against the tube just under the vocal cord. We visualized the glottic opening through the Airway Scope and found a membranous lesion at the ventral side of the glottis, diagnosing a congenital laryngeal web. We finally could insert a tracheal tube of ID 6.5 mm into the dorsal side of the glottis. Airway Scope may be a useful device for unexpected difficult tracheal intubation.",0,0
16480357,Use of a gum elastic bougie to facilitate blind nasotracheal intubation in children: a series of three cases,"Management of a difficult paediatric airway is challenging, and the unavailability of a paediatric fibreoptic bronchoscope, a common limitation in developing countries, adds to these difficulties. Children with bilateral temporomandibular joint ankylosis have limited mouth opening and therefore direct laryngoscopy and intubation is not usually possible. In the absence of sophisticated fibreoptic equipment, blind nasal intubation remains the only non-surgical option for control of the airway. Blind nasal intubation in paediatric anaesthesia is difficult. We describe a novel method of blind nasal intubation in paediatric patients using a gum elastic bougie. We have used this method successfully in three patients in whom tracheal intubation using a conventional blind nasal approach was unsuccessful. In view of its reliability and the absence of any soft tissue injury, we propose the use of this novel technique as an alternative to conventional blind nasal intubation, when more sophisticated fibreoptic equipment is not available.",0,0

21782386,Aerodynamic evaluation of the postthyroidectomy voice,"Objectives/hypotheses: Changes in vocal function before and after thyroidectomy were examined using aerodynamic and related assessments. Laryngeal airway resistance (R(law)) and phonation threshold pressure (PTP) were hypothesized to be sensitive to changes in laryngeal function that may occur after thyroidectomy separate from changes that may occur from endotracheal intubation alone. Study design: Prospective longitudinal clinical trial with comparison group. Methods: Eighty patients were evaluated preoperatively, and 2 weeks and 3 months postoperatively to assess voice outcomes after thyroidectomy. In addition, 16 patients who underwent a nonneck operation were tested as a control group. Maximum phonation time (MPT), mean airflow, R(law), and PTP were determined at two vocal fundamental frequency (F0) levels (30% and 80% of the F0 range). Results: No systematic differences were detected for MPT, mean airflow, or R(law) as a short-term or intermediate-term outcome of either surgical group. PTP decreased significantly over time for both groups of participants and at both F0 levels. F0 range decreased significantly at the short-term postsurgical assessment and covaried with the PTP results, thereby explaining some of the variability in the PTP data. Conclusions: Aerodynamic assessment did not reveal systematic changes in vocal function associated with thyroidectomy, although PTP decreased postoperatively for both surgical groups. This may be attributable in part to a learning effect or to postoperative reductions in F0 range.",0,0
10155534,Teaching basic EMTs endotracheal intubation: can basic EMTs discriminate between endotracheal and esophageal intubation?,"Hypothesis: Advanced airway intervention techniques are being considered for use by basic emergency medical technicians (EMTs). It was hypothesized that basic EMTs would be able to discriminate reliably between intratracheal and esophageal endotracheal tube placement in a mannequin model. Design: An airway mannequin with a closed chest cavity was intubated randomly either esophageally or tracheally, and the cuff was inflated. A stethoscope, bag ventilator, and laryngoscope were available next to the mannequin. Placement was assessed by auscultation or direct visualization at the discretion of the EMT. A blinded investigator graded the student. Setting: A classroom in a large, urban medical center. Participants: Subjects were basic EMTs who volunteered to take part after the conclusion of a six-hour endotracheal intubation training course. Results: Thirty-three subjects were tested. Seventeen of 18 (94%) tracheal intubations and 11 of 15 (73%) esophageal intubations were identified correctly. Only 72% of the students listened to the epigastrium, 81% listened to the lungs, and 85% attempted ventilation. The 10 students who visualized the cords discovered all five esophageal intubations. The 23 students who did not visualize the cords missed four and found six esophageal intubations. Conclusion: Basic EMTs had difficulty assessing endotracheal tube placement in a mannequin model. The 27% miss rate for identifying esophageal intubations suggests that basic EMTs will require additional training for safe field use of any airway that requires assessment of tube placement.",0,0
24071617,"Incidence, predictors, and outcome of difficult mask ventilation combined with difficult laryngoscopy: a report from the multicenter perioperative outcomes group","Background: Research regarding difficult mask ventilation (DMV) combined with difficult laryngoscopy (DL) is extremely limited even though each technique serves as a rescue for one another. Methods: Four tertiary care centers participating in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group used a consistent structured patient history and airway examination and airway outcome definition. DMV was defined as grade 3 or 4 mask ventilation, and DL was defined as grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view or four or more intubation attempts. The primary outcome was DMV combined with DL. Patients with the primary outcome were compared to those without the primary outcome to identify predictors of DMV combined with DL using a non-parsimonious logistic regression. Results: Of 492,239 cases performed at four institutions among adult patients, 176,679 included a documented face mask ventilation and laryngoscopy attempt. Six hundred ninety-eight patients experienced the primary outcome, an overall incidence of 0.40%. One patient required an emergent cricothyrotomy, 177 were intubated using direct laryngoscopy, 284 using direct laryngoscopy with bougie introducer, 163 using videolaryngoscopy, and 73 using other techniques. Independent predictors of the primary outcome included age 46 yr or more, body mass index 30 or more, male sex, Mallampati III or IV, neck mass or radiation, limited thyromental distance, sleep apnea, presence of teeth, beard, thick neck, limited cervical spine mobility, and limited jaw protrusion (c-statistic 0.84 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87]). Conclusion: DMV combined with DL is an infrequent but not rare phenomenon. Most patients can be managed with the use of direct or videolaryngoscopy. An easy to use unweighted risk scale has robust discriminating capacity.",0,0
12519141,Difficult paediatric intubation when fibreoptic laryngoscopy fails,"We report an unusual problem with fibreoptic bronchoscopy in an 8-year-old girl with Negar syndrome. She had a history of difficult airway since birth, and had undergone mandibular distraction for severe obstructive sleep apnoea when she was aged 2 years. Nagar syndrome is a Treacher-Collins like syndrome with normal intelligence, conductive bone deafness and problems with articulation. The patients have malar hypoplasia with down slanting palpebral fissures, high nasal bridge, micrognathia, absence of lower eyelashes, low set posteriorly rotated ears, preauricular tags, atresia of external ear canal, cleft palate, hypoplasia of thumb, with or without radius, and limited elbow extension. Protracted attempts with a fibreoptic bronchoscope failed to visualize the glottis, and this was only possible when the tube was guided to the larynx by blind nasal intubation. Apparently, the healing of the wounds for the mandibular distraction in the mandibular space on the inside of the rami of the mandible had caused differential fibrosis on either side of the hyoid, leading to a triplane distortion of the larynx with a left shift, clockwise rotation to a 2-8 o'clock direction and a slight tilt towards the left pharyngeal wall. The large epiglottis overlying this had precluded a view of the larynx. Finally, the older technique of breathguided intubation facilitated fibreoptic bronchoscopy to achieve tracheal intubation.",0,0
19618835,[Perioperative management of a case of myasthenic crisis with unexpected difficult airway],"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by loss of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) due primarily to the production of anti-AChR autoantibodies. We report here a case of anesthetic management of MG patient associated with difficult airway. A 58-year-old woman, 150 cm in height and 43 kg in weight, was scheduled for elective thymectomy. Preoperative evaluation using Mallampati classification, mouth opening, and thyromental distance did not predict airway difficulty. After anesthetic induction with propofol and sevoflurane, mask ventilation was performed easily. However, tracheal intubation using Macintosh type laryngoscope was unexpectedly difficult. This was largely due to transformation of the epiglottis and thereby Cormack classification was grade III. Tracheal intubation was eventually performed by blindly with a gum elastic bougie after some trials. Postoperative day two, she was diagnosed as postoperative myasthenic crisis and needed re-intubation. We used fiberscope intubation for her because it was difficult to intubate.""Cannot intubate, cannot ventilate (CICV)"" scenario is very rare, but it sometimes leads to serious morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we need to deal with this emergency situation by using a variety of equipments and techniques. Careful examination of the airway and a carefully considered plan for re-intubation are prerequisites for this type of surgery.",0,0
25870180,Correlation between changes in thyromental distance and distance of migration of oral Ring-Adair-Elwyn tubes during neck extension with a shoulder positioner in patients undergoing neck procedures,"Objectives: To measure the migration of oral Ring-Adair-Elwyn (RAE) preformed tracheal tubes during neck extension compared with the neutral neck position, and to assess the correlation between changes in the thyromental distance (TMD) during changes in neck position and tracheal tube migration. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled adult patients undergoing elective neck or thyroid procedures below the mandible. Using fibreoptic bronchoscopy, distances from the RAE tube adapter to the carina and to the tube tip were measured in the neutral position and after neck extension with a 10 cm D-shaped gel shoulder positioner. The change in distance of the RAE tube tip migration was compared with the change in TMD in each patient. Results: This study enrolled 106 patients. During neck extension with a 10-cm shoulder positioner, RAE tubes cranially migrated 2.7 cm from the neutral position, but RAE tube migration was not correlated with the change in external TMD. Conclusion: Oral RAE tube migration was not significantly correlated with the change in external TMD. Due to their large variability, changes in TMD were not useful predictors of RAE tube migration.",0,0
19378515,A comparative study between one and two effective doses (ED95) of rocuronium for tracheal intubation,"Background and objectives: Neuromuscular blockers (NMB) are used to induce relaxation of skeletal muscles and facilitate tracheal intubation (TI). According to the literature, two effective doses (ED95) of NMB are ideal for TI. Rocuronium is a steroid-type, synthetic, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker of medium duration. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the conditions of tracheal intubation with one and two effective doses (ED95) of rocuronium, following the criteria of the Copenhagen Consensus Conference. Methods: Sixty patients of both genders, ages 20 to 60 years, physical status ASA I and II, Mallampati 1 and 2, body mass index (BMI) < 35, who underwent general anesthesia, randomly divided in two groups of 30 patients, were evaluated. Group 1 (G1) received 0.3 mg kg(-1) of rocuronium (1 ED95, and Group 2 (G2) received 0.6 mg kg(-1) (2 DE95). Parameters used to evaluate TI were based on the criteria of the Copenhagen Consensus Conference (Good Clinical Research Practice): laryngoscopy, vocal cords (position and movements), reaction to the insertion of the tube and/or filling of the cuff (movements of limbs and cough). Results: All intubations were considered excellent or good (acceptable); therefore, there were no cases of failure or any intubation considered bad (unacceptable). The results of the statistical analysis were not significant. Consequently, we did not observe any clinically significant differences in the parameters evaluated Conclusions: Both doses of rocuronium, 0.3 mg kg(-1) and 0.6 mg kg(-1) ED95, provided clinically satisfactory parameters of TI in elective procedures.",0,0
11123731,Fibreoptic nasal intubation in children with anticipated and unanticipated difficult intubation,"The establishment of a tracheal airway with direct laryngoscopy can be either a very difficult or an impossible task in children with congenital or acquired facial malformations. Out of 46 patients categorized as difficult tracheal intubation, fibreoptic laryngoscopy was used successfully in 44 children anaesthetized by mask with sevoflurane and oxygen or by an intravenous infusion of propofol and mask oxygenation. There were two failures (4.3%). One was due to excessive bleeding and secretions produced by the multiple attempts to intubate with direct laryngoscopy and the other failure in a patient with Pierre Robin syndrome and very small nasal passages that precluded the introduction of the endoscope. Fibreoptic laryngoscopy was successful in 37 cases (80.4%) on the first attempt to intubate and in seven (15.2%) on a second or third attempt. We conclude that fibreoptic laryngoscopy in anaesthetized children with difficult anticipated or unanticipated tracheal intubation in trained hands is a safe technique that can be lifesaving. Therefore, we urge all anaesthesia trainees to become proficient in fibreoptic tracheal intubation.",0,0
9492502,[Anesthetic management involving difficult intubation in a child with Gaucher disease],"Gaucher disease is the most common of the glycolipid storage disorders caused by the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. Accumulation of the substrate leads to multiorgan dysfunction involving the brain, spleen, liver, lymph node and bone marrow. In anesthetic management, gastroesophageal reflux leading to recurrent aspiration, pancytopenia and airway difficulties due to trismus, neck extension and upper airway infiltration with glucocerebroside must be considered. We report a case of a 9-year-old boy presenting developmental delay, mild pancytopenia, splenomegary gastroesophageal reflux. He was scheduled for measurement of intra-esophageal pressure, total splenectomy and Nissen fundoplication. Preoperative examination showed trismus and opisthotonic posturing. We predicted difficult airway maintenance and assessed his airway with airway radiograph. Airway narrowing was not shown. For this difficult airway, we made a special mask that has an introducer port for fiberbronchoscope. For the first time, we tried to insert a laryngeal mask, but the insertion was difficult due to trismus and narrowed oral cavity. Then, we used this special mask for the next time. Tracheal intubation was much safer by using this mask for fiberoptic intubation. In Gaucher disease, preoperative assessment of airway difficulties and preparation for this situation are necessary and anesthesiologist must be concerned about aspiration and airway difficulties.",0,0
25903774,Robust camera localisation with depth reconstruction for bronchoscopic navigation,"Purpose: Bronchoscopy is a standard technique for airway examination, providing a minimally invasive approach for both diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases. To target lesions identified pre-operatively, it is necessary to register the location of the bronchoscope to the CT bronchial model during the examination. Existing vision-based techniques rely on the registration between virtually rendered endobronchial images and videos based on image intensity or surface geometry. However, intensity-based approaches are sensitive to illumination artefacts, while gradient-based approaches are vulnerable to surface texture. Methods: In this paper, depth information is employed in a novel way to achieve continuous and robust camera localisation. Surface shading has been used to recover depth from endobronchial images. The pose of the bronchoscopic camera is estimated by maximising the similarity between the depth recovered from a video image and that captured from a virtual camera projection of the CT model. The normalised cross-correlation and mutual information have both been used and compared for the similarity measure. Results: The proposed depth-based tracking approach has been validated on both phantom and in vivo data. It outperforms the existing vision-based registration methods resulting in smaller pose estimation error of the bronchoscopic camera. It is shown that the proposed approach is more robust to illumination artefacts and surface texture and less sensitive to camera pose initialisation. Conclusions: A reliable camera localisation technique has been proposed based on depth information for bronchoscopic navigation. Qualitative and quantitative performance evaluations show the clinical value of the proposed framework.",0,0
20526887,A comparison of direct laryngoscopic views depending on pillow height,"Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the optimal pillow height for the best laryngoscopic view. Methods: Fifty patients were enrolled and preanesthetic airway evaluations were recorded. After induction of anesthesia, the Macintosh 3 blade was used for direct laryngoscopy without a pillow or with a pillow 3, 6, or 9 cm high in randomized order while the laryngeal view was imaged continuously on a monitor of the integrated video system. The best direct laryngoscopic view was sought for in each condition and graded by one anesthesiologist. The correlations between the preanesthetic airway assessments and the pillow height providing the best laryngoscopic view were analyzed. Results: The laryngoscopic view with the 9-cm pillow was significantly superior to that with other pillows and without a pillow (P < 0.001). The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy (Cormack and Lehane grade 3) was 16% without a pillow. In these cases, laryngoscopic views were improved with a 9-cm pillow. In five patients with a short neck (<15 cm), better laryngoscopic view was observed with a 3- or 6-cm pillow compared with the 9-cm pillow. Neck length had a significant correlation (rho = 0.326, P = 0.027) with the pillow height providing the best laryngoscopic views. Conclusion: We recommend the use of a 9-cm pillow during direct laryngoscopy in the sniffing position. In contrast, pillows <9 cm appear to be advantageous in short-necked patients.",0,0
21800222,"Nasal versus oronasal continuous positive airway pressure masks for obstructive sleep apnea: a pilot investigation of pressure requirement, residual disease, and leak","Purpose: This single-blinded, randomized, controlled pilot study aimed to investigate whether there is a difference between nasal and oronasal masks in therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) requirement, residual disease, or leak when treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and if differences were related to measures of upper airway size. Methods: Patients with severe OSA currently using CPAP at ≥4 h/night with a nasal mask were examined (including Mallampati scale, incisal relationship, and mandibular protrusion) and then randomized to receive auto-positive airway pressure (PAP) or fixed CPAP at a manually titrated pressure for 1 week each at home, with immediate crossover. Within each week, a nasal mask and two oronasal masks were to be used for two or three nights each in random order. Data were downloaded from the device. Results: Twelve patients completed the trial (mean ± SD AHI 59.8 ± 28.6 events/h; CPAP 11.1 ± 3.2 cmH(2)O; BMI 37.7 ± 5.0 kg/m(2)). During auto-PAP, the median 95th percentile pressure delivered with all masks was within 0.5 cmH(2)O (p > 0.05). During CPAP, median residual AHI was 0.61 (IQR = 1.18) for the nasal mask, 1.70 (IQR = 4.04) for oronasal mask 1, and 2.48 (IQR = 3.74) for oronasal mask 2 (p = 0.03). The 95th percentile leak was lowest with the nasal mask during both CPAP and auto-PAP (both p < 0.01). Differences in pressure or residual disease were not related to measures of upper airway shape or body habitus. Conclusions: In obese OSA patients changing from a nasal to oronasal mask increased leak and residual AHI but did not affect the therapeutic pressure requirement. The findings of the current study highlight mask leak as the major difficulty in the use of oronasal masks.",0,0
21474023,Difficult intubation in children: applicability of the Mallampati index,"Background and objectives: The concern of facing difficult airways brought the need of developing predictive testing for difficult intubation. Those tests were developed primarily for adult populations. In pediatric patients studies always focus on patients with congenital malformation, polytraumatized, and newborns. The objective of the present study was to determine the applicability of the predictive test used more often in adults, the Mallampati index, in patients 4 to 8 years old, correlating it with the Cormack-Lehane index. Methods: One hundred and eight patients 4 to 8 years of age, ASA I, without any type of congenital malformation, genetic syndromes or cognitive deficits were evaluated. The Mallampati index was applied to patients during the pre-anesthetic evaluation. Evaluation of the Cormack-Lehane index was performed after anesthetic induction. A p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The Mallampati index showed a significant correlation with the Cormack-Lehane index. The sensitivity and specificity of the Mallampati index were 75.8% and 96.2% respectively, but the sensitivity showed a wide confidence interval. Conclusions: The Mallampati index was proven to be applicable in children 4 to 8 years old.",0,0

The technique provides safe, efficient airway management for patients with burns to the head and neck and significantly diminishes patient risks.",0,0
22856507,Methods for evaluating cervical range of motion in trauma settings,"Immobilisation of the cervical spine is a common procedure following traumatic injury. This is often precautionary as the actual incidence of spinal injury is low. Nonetheless, stabilisation of the head and neck is an important part of pre-hospital care due to the catastrophic damage that may follow if further unrestricted movement occurs in the presence of an unstable spinal injury. Currently available collars are limited by the potential for inadequate immobilisation and complications caused by pressure on the patient's skin, restricted airway access and compression of the jugular vein. Alternative approaches to cervical spine immobilisation are being considered, and the investigation of these new methods requires a standardised approach to the evaluation of neck movement. This review summarises the research methods and scientific technology that have been used to assess and measure cervical range of motion, and which are likely to underpin future research in this field. A systematic search of international literature was conducted to evaluate the methodologies used to assess the extremes of movement that can be achieved in six domains. 34 papers were included in the review. These studies used a range of methodologies, but study quality was generally low. Laboratory investigations and biomechanical studies have gradually given way to methods that more accurately reflect the real-life situations in which cervical spine immobilisation occurs. Latterly, new approaches using virtual reality and simulation have been developed. Coupled with modern electromagnetic tracking technology this has considerable potential for effective application in future research. However, use of these technologies in real life settings can be problematic and more research is needed.",0,0
18983229,Difficult intubation provokes bacteremia,"Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of bacteremia after mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and endotracheal intubation before induction of general anesthesia and to discover any correlation between traumatic manipulations and bacteremia. The specific bacteria responsible, knowledge of which may guide the prophylactic use of antibiotics, also were investigated. Methods: Fifty patients were enrolled. Three 10-mL blood samples were collected from a peripheral vein 10 min before induction of anesthesia, 10 min after mask ventilation, and 10 min after intubation. All samples were placed in aerobic and anaerobic bottles for culture and bacterial identification. Results: Cultures received 10 min after intubation were positive in 12% of patients. The following strains were isolated: Escherichia coli in two cases, Staphylococcus aureus in three cases, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. A strong positive correlation was found between difficult intubation and bacteremia. No correlation between bacteremia and easy intubation or between bacteremia and face mask ventilation was identified. Conclusion: Traumatic manipulations during difficult laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation could cause bacteremia. This finding may justify and guide prophylactic use of antibiotics.",0,0
22416488,Prevalence of and risk factors for obstructive syndrome apnea,"Introduction: Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is becoming an important public health problem because of its frequency and adverse health consequences. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for OSA in a cohort of subjects working for the french Army. Subjects and methods: This prospective study was carried out on a sample of volunteers working for the French army. The subjects were recruited at their annual work visit between November 2008 and September 2009. Subjects were asked to complete 2 screening questionnaires (Epworth and Berlin) and were given a medical examination. Subjects suspected of having OSAS (based on high questionnaire scores) were monitored by nocturnal ventilatory polygraphy. OSAS was diagnosed if the subject was found to have an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) greater than or equal to 5. Results: In this healthy, young and active population (n = 1054), 4.20% of subjects were diagnosed with OSA. Comparing our two groups of subjects (OSA and non-OSA), several statistically significant (p < .05) differences emerged that may be associated with OSA: the individuals with OSA were older by an average of 7 years, they presented with an average BMI greater than 4.5 kg/m2, an average abdominal girth greater than 12.2 cm and an average cervical circumference greater than 2.6 cm. In addition, they consumed more tobacco when they were smokers and were more likely to present with permanent nasal obstruction. They were also more likely to suffer from gastroesophageal reflux and present with skeletal class II. Finally, they presented with a longer average soft palate as determined by the Mallampati scoring system. Conclusion: We found that the major risk factors for OSAS were age, BMI, abdominal girth and cervical circumference (linear correlations determined by bi-variate analysis).",0,0
25823117,Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: a rare cause of difficult intubation,"Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica is a rare benign airway disorder which is characterised by submucosal nodules projecting into the tracheo-bronchial lumen usually involving the cartilaginous portions of the tracheo-bronchial tree or larynx. The condition is usually asymptomatic but can rarely present with difficulty during endotracheal intubation or rarely with obstructive airway complications. Bronchoscopic appearance is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis, and tissue biopsies are seldom required. No specific treatment is required in asymptomatic patients. However, interventional bronchoscopy procedures or surgery may be helpful in symptomatic cases.",0,0

22091734,Forces applied to the maxillary incisors by video laryngoscopes and the Macintosh laryngoscope,"Background: Modern video laryngoscopes (VLSs) provide a superior view of the glottis, facilitating easier intubations. This study evaluates the forces applied to the maxillary incisors when using various VLSs and a Macintosh blade. Methods: Fifty consecutive surgery patients were randomly assigned to receive laryngoscopy from a pair of four blades investigated in the study - the VLS GlideScope(®) (Verathon Inc., Bothell, WA, USA), V-Mac™ Storz(®) (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), and McGrath™ (Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, United Kingdom); and the classic Macintosh blade also from Storz(®) (Karl Storz). An endotracheal tube (ETT) was brought into position anterior to the vocal cords, with actual intubation carried out only with the second of the laryngoscopes. Sensors measured the forces directly applied to the patient's maxillary incisors while inserting the ETT. Other common metrics of intubation difficulty (e.g. Mallampati grade, Cormack-Lehane grade, and time) were also recorded. Results: Only one patient was not intubated within the standard study parameters and was converted to the hospital protocols for difficult intubations. The forces applied to the maxillary incisors were significantly greater with the Macintosh blade compared with all VLSs. There were no differences between the VLSs with regard to the forces. Patient characteristics, including Mallampati grade, were not predictive of the forces applied. Conclusions: All VLSs considered were safer for the patient than was the Macintosh blade in terms of the forces applied to the maxillary teeth, time, number of insertion attempts, and view achieved of the glottic arch. There is a small, but significant, difference in the time and number of insertion attempts required during laryngoscopy with the different VLSs. There was no difference in the forces applied. The geometry of the respective blades may be an important component in the ease of laryngoscopy.",0,0
20864892,Failure to predict difficult tracheal intubation for emergency caesarean section,"Background and aim: Difficult tracheal intubation following induction of general anaesthesia for caesarean section is a cause of morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to evaluate five bedside predictors that might identify women with potential intubation difficulty immediately prior to emergency caesarean section. Patients and methods: Women requiring emergency caesarean section with general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation who had been assessed by the same experienced anaesthesiologist preoperatively were included in this study. Mallampati score, sternomental distance, thyromental distance, interincisor gap and atlantooccipital extension were all measured. The same anaesthesiologist performed laryngoscopy and graded the laryngeal view according to Cormack and Lehane. Exact logistic regression was used to identify significant independent predictors for difficult intubation (Cormack and Lehane grades ≥ 3) with two-sided P value less than 0.05 considered as significant. Results: In 3 years, 239 women were recruited. Cormack and Lehane grades of 2 or less (easy) were found in 225 and grade of at least 3 (difficult) in 14 women. Patients' characteristics (age, height, weight, BMI or weight gain) were not significantly associated with difficulty of intubation. The incidence of difficult intubation was 1/17 women [95% confidence interval (CI) from 1/31 to 1/10]. A positive result from any of the five predictors combined had a sensitivity of 0.21 (95%CI 0.05-0.51), a specificity of 0.92 (95%CI 0.88-0.96), a positive predictive value of 0.15 (95%CI 0.032-0.38) and a negative predictive value of 0.95 (95%CI 0.91-0.97) for a Cormack and Lehane grade of at least 3 at laryngoscopy. Conclusion: Airway assessment using these tests cannot be relied upon to predict a difficult intubation at emergency caesarean section as the low sensitivity means that 79% (95%CI 49-95) of difficult intubations will be missed.",1,1
19930827,Minimizing trauma to the upper airway: a ferret model of neonatal intubation,"Our objective was to determine whether an adult ferret can be intubated as many as 10 times per training session without resulting in trauma to the upper airway. In this program, 8 male ferrets rotated through intubation laboratories, limiting the use of each animal to once every 3 mo. Animals were examined by the veterinary staff after intubations to assess for trauma to upper airway tissue. Each examination was given a trauma grade of 0 for no visible signs of trauma, 1 if erythema of the larynx was present, 2 if visible excoriation of the mucus membranes was present, and 3 if bleeding (frank hemorrhage) was observed. The number of intubation attempts was restricted to 10 per animal per training session. A total of 170 intubations were completed on the ferrets during a 12-mo period. The average number of intubations per laboratory was 8.1 intubations per ferret. In addition, 1.8% of the intubations resulted in erythema (score, 1) after training, and 0.6% of the intubations resulted in excoriation (score, 2). Frank hemorrhage (score, 3) was not noted. The overall percentage of intubations resulting in any trauma during a training session was 0.02%. None of the animals have experienced any major complications to date. This ongoing training program has been used to teach neonatal intubation skills to emergency medicine residents for the past 12 mo. Ensuring the health and safety of the ferrets was paramount. Our results suggest that as many as 10 intubation attempts per session can be performed safely on each ferret without causing excessive trauma.",0,0
21704990,Adverse events during monitored anesthesia care for GI endoscopy: an 8-year experience,"Background: The importance of sedation during endoscopy is well established. There is no consensus about the best techniques for sedation, which specialist should perform it, and in which location. Objective: To provide data on the epidemiology of adverse events during sedation for endoscopy. Design: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database. Setting: Endoscopy unit of a university hospital. Procedures: A total of 17,999 procedures performed over 8 years. Interventions: Sedation for GI endoscopy. Main outcome measurements: We recorded the following information: sex, age, body mass index, smoking habits, American Society of Anesthesiologists and Mallampati scores, duration of the procedure, type of sedative drug administered, whether the procedure was performed emergently, and endoscopic interventions during the maneuver. Adverse events were defined as occurrences that warranted intervention and were classified as hypotension, desaturation, bradycardia, hypertension, arrhythmia, aspiration, respiratory depression, vomiting, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, angina, hypoglycemia, and/or allergic reaction. Results: Deep sedation with intravenous propofol target controlled infusion pump was the most frequently used means of administering sedation. Adverse events were rare in both the adult (4.5%) and pediatric (2.6%) populations. Six complications occurred in more than 0.1% of adult cases: arterial hypotension, desaturation, bradycardia, arterial hypertension, arrhythmia, and aspiration. Only bradycardia (2.1%) and hypotension (0.44%) occurred in children. Three adult patients (0.017%) died, and no pediatric patients died. Some predictive models for the occurrence of complications are proposed. Limitations: Retrospective analysis, single-center data collection. Conclusions: Deep sedation during endoscopic procedures is safe in both adults and children. Our data may be useful for the future planning of new clinical strategies in this setting.",0,0
10214786,Utility of radiographs in the evaluation of pediatric upper airway obstruction,"The evaluation of children with airway obstruction always involves a history and physical examination. The definitive diagnosis is most often made with microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB), and in cases of extrinsic compression, information is gained from magnetic resonance imaging. Although plain radiographs of the airway are often used as a primary diagnostic modality in children with airway obstruction, the accuracy of plain radiographs in predicting specific airway abnormalities has not previously been evaluated. This study was designed to correlate the findings of plain airway radiographs with the diagnosis made at the time of MLB. Medical records from 1991 to 1996 were reviewed to identify patients that had MLB and airway radiographs within 2 days of one another. One hundred forty-four cases were identified and divided into diagnostic categories. Statistical analysis showed a high sensitivity (>86%) for the accuracy of the radiologic diagnoses of exudative tracheitis, airway foreign body, and innominate artery compression. Laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia had a much lower sensitivity (5% and 62%, respectively). We believe that plain radiographic evaluation of the airway provides important information to the diagnostician. However, plain radiographs can be inaccurate and must be considered along with a history, physical examination, and clinical suspicion. Microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy remains the ultimate diagnostic test for airway disorders.",0,0
1853739,"[Tooth injuries during general anesthesia, oral endoscopy and vibro-massage]","It is generally recognized that dental injury during and after tracheal intubation is a significant problem. Damage may occur during oro-tracheal intubation, oral endoscopy or seismotherapy. The incidence was reported in a study conducted in the contentious department of Lyon hospitals, in France, from 1978 to 1988. Results confirm that damage is relatively common and that the majority of damaged teeth (67%) were known to have been previously restored, or weakened through periodontal disease prior to the damage occurring. Maxillary incisors were the most frequently injured teeth. Fracture of crowns and roots of natural teeth (44,8%), followed by partial luxation (20,8%) and avulsion (20,8%) were the most common injury. Several cases are presented which reveal the clinical value of dental damages that occur during orotracheal intubation, oral endoscopy or seismotherapy. Besides dental or gingival complications can appear immediately but also after a few days or weeks. Some of the most recent development in dental therapy such as the butterfly bridge, titanium implants and porcelain laminate veneers are described. Tooth protective guards must be put into widespread use. Legal implications of dental lesions occurring during oro-tracheal intubation, oral endoscopy or seismotherapy are presented.",0,0
26250700,"Airway management by physician-staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Services - a prospective, multicentre, observational study of 2,327 patients","Background: Despite numerous studies on prehospital airway management, results are difficult to compare due to inconsistent or heterogeneous data. The objective of this study was to assess advanced airway management from international physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical services. Methods: We collected airway data from 21 helicopter emergency medical services in Australia, England, Finland, Hungary, Norway and Switzerland over a 12-month period. A uniform Utstein-style airway template was used for collecting data. Results: The participating services attended 14,703 patients on primary missions during the study period, and 2,327 (16 %) required advanced prehospital airway interventions. Of these, tracheal intubation was attempted in 92 % of the cases. The rest were managed with supraglottic airway devices (5 %), bag-valve-mask ventilation (2 %) or continuous positive airway pressure (0.2 %). Intubation failure rates were 14.5 % (first-attempt) and 1.2 % (overall). Cardiac arrest patients showed significantly higher first-attempt intubation failure rates (odds ratio: 2.0; 95 % CI: 1.5-2.6; p < 0.001) compared to non-cardiac arrest patients. Complications were recorded in 13 %, with recognised oesophageal intubation being the most frequent (25 % of all patients with complications). For non-cardiac arrest patients, important risk predictors for first-attempt failure were patient age (a non-linear association) and administration of sedatives (reduced failure risk). The patient's sex, provider's intubation experience, trauma type (patient category), indication for airway intervention and use of neuromuscular blocking agents were not risk factors for first-attempt intubation failure. Conclusions: Advanced airway management in physician-staffed prehospital services was performed frequently, with high intubation success rates and low complication rates overall. However, cardiac arrest patients showed significantly higher first-attempt failure rates compared to non-cardiac arrest patients. All failed intubations were handled successfully with a rescue device or surgical airway. Study registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01502111 . Registered 22 December 2011.",0,0
23404777,Simulation-based training in advanced airway skills in an otolaryngology residency program,"Objectives/hypothesis: Life-support training emphasizes the primacy of airway management. Acquiring these skills requires practice and exposure to events. Otolaryngology residents lack standardized training in advanced airway skills. This project aimed to create such a program by using simulation-based methodology evaluated using specific educationally based tools. Study design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: The program consisted of lectures and simulation-based training sessions designed to impart competency in a set of defined airway skills to otolaryngology residents. Only participating residents who completed the course (n = 12) were evaluated both before and after the course for their fund of knowledge through multiple-choice examinations and for clinical reasoning and technical skills as assessed by a panel of otolaryngologists in simulated difficult airway situations. Self-assessment tools were also incorporated. Results: The average multiple choice score was 12 of 27 (44%) before the course and 15 of 27 (55%) after the completion of the course (P = .001). Faculty assessment yielded a cumulative score of 80% and 91% pre- and postcourse, respectively (P = .002). Although all residents reported prior experience in a critical emergency airway situation, only one reported prior training in advanced airway skills. A significant increase in participants' self-perceived ability to carry out critical airway-related skills was observed. All respondents felt the course was effective. Conclusions: Simulation-based airway training courses can be effectively incorporated into existing educational curricula for otolaryngology residents, and their success can be measured using educationally based tools. With such a course, residents can be expected to demonstrate measurable improvement in clinical knowledge base, technical skills, and self-perceived ability to handle difficult airway situations.",0,0
22865169,Dettol poisoning and the need for airway intervention,"OBJECTIVES. To (1) characterise the clinical features of Dettol poisoning on a territory-wide basis, (2) assess the need for airway intervention after such poisoning and its time frame after ingestion, and (3) identify predictors for such an intervention. DESIGN. Case series. SETTING. Sixteen accident and emergency departments in Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Patients with Dettol ingestion who presented within 48 hours of ingestion from July 2005 to June 2009, derived from the database of the Hong Kong Poison Information Centre. RESULTS. In all, 213 patient records were identified, of which 36 were excluded based on pre-defined criteria and 177 were analysed. Among the latter, the median age was 32 (range, 2-95) years and the male-to-female ratio was 1:2.7 (48:129). Intentional ingestion constituted the majority (95%) of cases. The most common symptoms were related to the local irritative/corrosive effects on the aero-digestive tract, such as gastro-intestinal upset and localised throat pain. Airway intervention was required in 14 (8%) patients. All interventions were performed within 12 hours of Dettol ingestion and three cases involved re-intubation after extubation. Univariate analysis showed that a Glasgow Coma Scale score of <8, older age, a larger amount ingested, lip swelling, lung crackles, and wheezing were all associated with airway intervention. In the multivariate analysis using forward stepwise logistic regression, only coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score of <8) remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS. Delayed airway obstruction (>12 hours after Dettol ingestion) is unlikely. For those who are intubated, careful assessment of airway adequacy before extubation is strongly recommended to avoid extubation failure and subsequent re-intubation. Patients in coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score of <8) should prompt airway intervention.",0,0
21952324,Thin bronchoscope for evaluating stenotic airways during stenting procedures,"Background: Flexible bronchoscopy can play an important role in the evaluation of an airway lumen during therapeutic bronchoscopic procedures. Despite its potential usefulness, however, evaluation with a standard-sized bronchoscope, which cannot pass completely through a severely stenosed airway, is often unsatisfactory. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of prototype thin bronchoscopes for assessing stenotic airways during stenting procedures. Methods: Forty-six patients with central airway stenosis requiring stent implantation were enrolled in this prospective study. After inserting a rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia, a flexible bronchoscopic evaluation using a 5.9- or 6.0-mm standard bronchoscope was performed, followed by evaluation using a prototype 3.4- or 3.5-mm thin bronchoscope for airways beyond the site of stenosis, which could not be visualized by the standard bronchoscope. Results: A standard bronchoscope could not pass through the stenotic airway in 15 of 46 patients (33%). On univariate analysis, the grade of stenosis (p < 0.001), the presence or absence of atelectasis (p = 0.04) and the presence or absence of viscous secretions (p = 0.02) were related to the rate of successful passage by a standard bronchoscope. On multivariate analysis, only the grade of stenosis remained independently associated with the success rate. In 12 of the 15 patients (80%), the airway lumen beyond the stenotic lesion, which could not be reached by a standard bronchoscope, was successfully visualized and evaluated with a thin bronchoscope. No significant complications were associated with the procedures. Conclusion: The thin bronchoscope can be a useful tool for evaluating a severely stenosed airway during the stenting procedure.",0,0
23265028,"Hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia and difficult laryngoscopy: a retrospective review","Background: The incidence of difficulty with intubation in the general population depends upon the definition used but results as high as 37% have been published. Endocrine disorders such as diabetes and hyperthyroidism have been linked to an increased incidence of difficult intubation via laryngoscopy. Hypercalcemia with resulting calcification has been demonstrated to result in neck pain, decreased cervical range of motion, and loss of skin and tendon compliance. We speculated that patients with hyperparathyroidism and resulting hypercalcemia would have an increased incidence of intubation difficulty via laryngoscopy. Methods: We studied 382 patients presenting for parathyroidectomy in whom direct laryngoscopy was initially attempted compared to 262 patients presenting for abdominal surgery in whom laryngoscopy was initially attempted via retrospective chart review. Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as 3 or greater attempts at direct laryngoscopy or 2 attempts and the use of airway adjunct (Eschmann stylet), flexible fiberoptics, or an indirect laryngoscope (Pentax AWS or Airtraq). Awkward intubation was defined as requiring > 1 attempt at laryngoscopy, intubation requiring a change in laryngoscope blade, the use of an airway adjunct (Eschmann stylet), or a Cormack and Lehane's view on initial laryngoscopy > 2. Hypercalcemia was defined as serum [Ca2+] > 10.2 mg/ dl. Propensity score matching was done to create 88 matched patient sets. McNemar's test was used to evaluate intubation difficulties in patients presenting for parathyroidectomy. The relationship between difficult laryngoscopy and hypercalcemia in parathyroidectomy patients was assessed by simple logistic regression (unadjusted) and multiple logistic regression. Results: There is no difference in the rate of difficult or awkward laryngoscopy or the rate at which laryngoscopy was abandoned in favor of another means of intubation between parathryoidectomy and abdominal surgery patients. Hypercalcemia also does not impact laryngoscopy difficulty. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first manuscript evaluating the impact of parathryoidectomy surgery and hypercalcemia on ease of intubation via laryngoscopy. Despite the fact that patients presenting for parathyroidecomy have many potential etiologies of increased difficulty with laryngoscopy, they do not appear to be at increased risk of laryngoscopy problems. The same is true of those patients presenting with hypercalcemia. Source(s) of support: There was no source of funding for this study.

23519725,Anesthetic management of a parturient with VACTERL association undergoing Cesarean delivery,"Purpose: We present the anesthetic management of a parturient with VACTERL association undergoing combined regional and general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery. Defined as a syndrome, VACTERL association comprises at least three of the following abnormalities: vertebral, anal atresia, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb. Clinical features: The patient's anatomic abnormalities and comorbidities comprised severe cervicothoracic scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, congenitally fused ribs, and severe restrictive lung disease. She had a Mallampati class 3 airway, a right laterally flexed neck, and reduced mandibular protrusion. We performed a lumbar spine ultrasound for epidural placement which was used to provide peri- and postoperative analgesia. Due to the anticipated difficult tracheal intubation, the patient underwent an awake fibreoptic intubation and subsequently received general anesthesia. The patient's trachea was extubated on the first postoperative day, and she received adequate post-Cesarean epidural analgesia. Conclusion: This case highlights the challenges that anesthesiologists face when managing parturients at extremely high risk for perioperative anesthetic morbidity due to the presence of severe pre-existing disease, anticipated difficult airway, and major spinal abnormalities complicating neuraxial anesthesia. We used a combined general and epidural anesthetic approach to control ventilation, provide effective postoperative analgesia, and reduce the risk of anesthetic-related perioperative morbidity. An individualized approach should be considered for the anesthetic management of high-risk pregnant patients with complex and multiple medical and surgical morbidities undergoing labour and delivery.",0,0
10748964,Fibre-optic aided bougie (FAB) for simulated difficult tracheal intubation,"Introduction: Difficult intubation remains a key problem and the value of the gum elastic bougie as a first approach is well recognised. Materials and methods: A fine fibre-optic endoscope (Rapiscope, Cook Critical Care) was used in 50 patients to verify placement of a custom-designed hollow plastic bougie prior to ""rail-roading"" a tracheal tube. Following induction and muscle relaxation, direct laryngoscopy was performed after two-minutes of assisted ventilation. The laryngoscope blade was lowered to simulate difficult intubation and the bougie passed behind the epiglottis. The position of the introducer bougie was then checked using the Rapiscope. Following correct bronchoscopic identification of the tracheobronchial anatomy, a tracheal tube was then ""rail-roaded"" following withdrawal of the scope. Results: All patients were successfully intubated following identification of the bronchial tree by the Rapiscope: three on the second attempt and the rest on the first. Mean (SD, range) time to successful bronchoscopic confirmation of correct placement of the bougie was 38 s (9.1 s, 19 to 60 s). All bronchoscopic assisted intubation were subsequently confirmed by capnography after tracheal tube insertion. Mean (SD, range) time to successful intubation was 106 s (14 s, 52 to 132 s). Conclusion: The fibre-optic assisted bougie (FAB) offers a promising technique in patients who may be difficult to intubate but who can be ventilated. Further developments are required to achieve a faster intubation time but oxygenation may be achieved by jetting down the hollow bougie.",0,0
21890882,A mannequin study of intubation with the AP advance and GlideScope Ranger videolaryngoscopes and the Macintosh laryngoscope,"Background: The AP Advance (APA) is a videolaryngoscope with interchangeable blades: intubators can choose standard Macintosh blades or a difficult-airway blade with increased curvature and a channel to guide the tube to the larynx. The APA may therefore be comparably effective in both normal and difficult airways. We tested the hypotheses that intubation with the APA is no slower than Macintosh laryngoscopy for normal mannequin airways, and that it is no slower than videolaryngoscopy using a GlideScope Ranger in difficult mannequin airways. Methods: Medical professionals whose roles potentially include tracheal intubation were trained with each device. Participants intubated simulated (Laerdal SimMan) normal and difficult airways with the APA, GlideScope, and a conventional Macintosh blade. Speed of intubation was compared using Cox proportional hazards regression, with a hazard ratio >0.8 considered noninferior. We also compared laryngeal visualization, failures, and participant preferences. Results: Unadjusted intubation times in the normal airway with the APA and Macintosh were virtually identical (median, 22 vs 23 seconds); after adjustment for effects of experience, order, and period, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) comparing APA with Macintosh laryngoscopy was 0.87 (0.65, 1.17), which was not significantly more than our predefined noninferiority boundary of 0.8 (P = 0.26). Intubation with the APA was faster than with the GlideScope in difficult airways (hazard ratio = 7.6 [5.0, 11.3], P < 0.001; median, 20 vs 59 seconds). All participants intubated the difficult airway mannequin with the APA, whereas 33% and 37% failed with the GlideScope and Macintosh, respectively. In the difficult airway, 99% of participants achieved a Cormack and Lehane grade I to II view with the APA, versus 85% and 33% with the GlideScope and Macintosh, respectively. When asked to choose 1 device overall, 82% chose the APA. Conclusions: Intubation times were similar with the APA and Macintosh laryngoscopes in mannequins with normal airways. However, intubation with the APA was significantly faster than with the GlideScope in the difficult mannequin simulation.",0,0
17031084,Alternative management techniques for the difficult airway: esophageal-tracheal Combitube,"Purpose of review: To summarize knowledge about the esophageal-tracheal Combitube in emergency medicine and anesthesia, with special emphasis on uncommon indications. Papers published between August 2003 and July 2004 are reviewed. Recent findings: Tracheal intubation in the field is difficult and success rates are dependent upon training level (90-98%). Therefore, the esophageal-tracheal Combitube has been recommended for emergency ventilation after failed tracheal intubation with success rates of about 90%, even when performed by emergency medical technicians. Combitube insertion is easy to learn, but practice is necessary to retain skills. Use of this device has also been recommended for ventilatory support during routine anesthesia. Combitube ventilation is successful in over 96% of patients, with minimal trauma. Since only a small percentage of American anesthesiologists are familiar with the Combitube (<50%), using the device in anesthesia care may improve the skills required during emergency airway management. Blood gases are in the range of those obtained during endotracheal tube ventilation and aspiration prophylaxis is at least as good as that of the laryngeal mask airway. Successful uncommon uses of the device have also been recommended, for example, Combitube ventilation in craniomaxillomandibular surgery via the submental route and insertion of the device in a burns patient with minimal mouth opening and significant tracheal stenosis after long-term ventilation. Summary: The esophageal-tracheal Combitube is a useful and efficient alternative airway characterized by high success rates in emergency situations. We recommend the use of a laryngoscope for insertion and strict adherence to the manufacturer's guidelines in order to maximize success and minimize potential injury.",0,0
22331679,The successful use of the nasopharyngeal airway in Pierre Robin sequence: an 11-year experience,"Introduction: Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a congenital anomaly presenting with micrognathia, glossoptosis and a cleft palate. This study describes a decade's experience of the management of upper airway obstruction (UAO) in PRS patients with a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). Methods: This study was conducted by paediatric respiratory and otolaryngology departments. Children with PRS referred with UAO were evaluated according to a standard protocol. Data collected included the degree of airway obstruction, method of airway management, polysomnography data before and after intervention, and longer term follow-up. Results: Data were collected on 104 PRS patients referred to us for airway assessment in 2000-2010. 64/104 were aged <4 weeks at referral. Airway symptoms were managed conservatively in 27 patients (25.9%), with an NPA in 63 (60.6%) and a tracheostomy in 14 (13.4%). The average duration of NPA use was 8 months (3 weeks to 27 months). Polysomnography results improved in all 63 patients with an NPA. Fourteen severely obstructed patients underwent a tracheostomy. 86.5% (90/104) of PRS patients were managed conservatively or with the help of an NPA. There were no NPA related complications. Conclusion: There is a spectrum of UAO in PRS. This study reports on long-term outcomes in 104 children with PRS and airway obstruction. In most children (86.5%), airway obstruction was managed by conservative measures or with an NPA for a few months. The natural history shows that with normal growth, airway compromise resolves without immediate surgical intervention as advocated by some practitioners. Few PRS children require a tracheostomy.",0,0

Oral intubation was impossible using both direct and fibreoptic techniques. Nasal fibreoptic intubation was successful but precluded the transsphenoidal approach to surgery. A Cook Airway Exchange Catheter [Cook (UK) Ltd, Monroe House, Letchworth SG6 1LN] was used with a Negus bronchoscope to convert to oral intubation and allow completion of surgery without resort to tracheostomy.",0,0
18855518,"Availability of difficult airway equipment to rural anaesthetists in Queensland, Australia","Introduction: Since 1990 several airway devices have become available to assist in difficult intubation. Multiple surveys have assessed difficult airway equipment availability in international anaesthetic departments and emergency departments. The practice of GP anaesthetists is unique in both its multidisciplinary nature and geographical isolation. Objectives: General practitioners performing general anaesthesia in rural and remote Queensland, Australia were surveyed to assess their access to difficult airway equipment and whether this was related to the remoteness of their location or attendance at continuing professional development activities. Design: survey. Setting: proceduralists performing general anaesthesia in hospitals categorised as Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Area (RRMA) classification 4 to 7 inclusive were surveyed. Outcome measure: data collected included demographic information, availability of airway management equipment, and attendance at continuing professional development activities. The received data was entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL, USA) using the frequencies and crosstabs functions. The Fisher's exact test was used. A p-value of less than 0.10 was considered noteworthy and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. A statistical comparison was made between the known demographics of the target population and the survey responders. The known demographics were derived from the Health Workforce Queensland database and included age, gender, practice location and practitioner type. Results: Seventy-nine surveys were distributed and 35 returned (response rate 44%). This represented 21 hospitals. There was no statistical difference between the target population and the survey responders in terms of age and gender. There was no statistical difference in terms of practice location, although the small percentage responding from RRMA 6 was notable. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of practitioner type. Hospital-based practitioners were relatively under-represented in the responder group. Eighty-two per cent of practitioners felt they had access to appropriate equipment and this was not significantly related the remoteness of their location. There was wide variation in available equipment. Simple adjuncts such as the bougie and stylet were not universally available but cricothyroidotomy sets were more common. Practitioners in the more remote locations were less likely to have attended an educational activity such as conference, workshop or skills laboratory (p=0.05). Conclusions: We suggest standardisation of difficult airway equipment for rural practitioners. This could be supported by increased availability of airway management workshops in remote areas. Such an intervention would be in line with other initiatives to standardise medical equipment in rural and remote Queensland hospitals. Familiarity with infrequently used equipment may assist practitioners and their locums. Standardisation of equipment and practice is a recognised method of improving patient safety.",0,0
22221690,Trachway intubating stylet for tracheal intubation in an ankylosing spondylitis patient undergoing total hip replacement under general anesthesia,"The Trachway is a new device which provides better glottic view than conventional direct laryngoscopy during tracheal intubation. This intubating stylet consists of a camera on the distal tip of the style, with a monitor attached to the rechargeable handle, so that it can overcome the difficulty of limited neck motion and mouth opening in tracheal intubation. We present here a 54-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis, scheduled to undergo total hip replacement. Pre-operative airway assessment revealed a recognized difficult airway. The Trachway was successfully used for oral tracheal intubation at the first attempt. The Trachway can be an alternative choice for intubation in ankylosing spondylitis patients.",0,0
16490088,Randomized controlled trial comparing the laryngeal tube and the laryngeal mask in pediatric patients,"Background: The laryngeal tube (LT) is a supraglottic ventilatory device used in adults. However, there is limited information about LT use in pediatric patients. This randomized controlled study compares LT with laryngeal mask (LMA) for airway management during spontaneous or assisted ventilation and during fiberoptic laryngoscopy in children. Methods: Thirty children under 10-years old, ASA I-II, scheduled for minor general surgery, Mallampati score I-II, fasted and premedicated were included. Patients with upper respiratory infection, craniofacial malformation, intracranial hypertension, emergency surgery were excluded. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients in whom effective spontaneous or assisted ventilation [Vt > or = 4 ml.kg(-1), SpO2 > or = 95% with FiO2 0.4, P(E)CO2 < or = 7.2 kPa (55 mmHg)] was achieved after 3 min of LT or LMA cuff inflation. The secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients in whom fiberoptic laryngoscopy resulted in identification of the vocal cords. Results: Eleven children with LMA and two children in LT group had adequate spontaneous or assisted ventilation after initial positioning (P < 0.01). After head extension or device repositioning 15 of 15 patients in LMA group had adequate ventilation compared with 11 of 15 patients in LT group (P < 0.05). The vocal cords could be observed with fiberoptic laryngoscopy in 11 LMA group patients compared with no patients in the LT group (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The LT is less effective than the LMA to allow adequate spontaneous or assisted ventilation and for fiberoptic evaluation of the airway in children under 10 years old.",0,0

9509203,The palm print as a sensitive predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in diabetics,"Background: Grading of the ink impression made by the palm of the hand has been proposed as a means of screening diabetic patients in whom tracheal intubation may be difficult because of glycosylation of both metacarpal and cervical joints. The current study was designed to test the predictability of the palm print and other airway evaluation indices in a diabetic population. Method: 83 adult, diabetic patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were evaluated preoperatively using 4 physical examination indices predictive of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation: Mallampati classification, thyromental distance, head extension, and palm print. Following induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular relaxation, laryngoscopy was performed and the laryngoscopic view scored. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of each airway evaluation index was calculated. Results: The palm print had the highest sensitivity of all indices (100%). The other 3 indices failed to detect 9 to 13 difficult laryngoscopies. Conclusion: We believe that in the diabetic population, the palm print index may be a sensitive marker of difficult intubation. It is possible that other airway evaluation indices would prove more sensitive, and have greater utility, in distinct populations as compared to when they are applied to all patients.",1,1
20090540,Cardiovascular responses and airway complications following awake nasal intubation with blind intubation device and fibreoptic bronchoscope: a randomized controlled study,"Background and objective: The blind intubation device (BID) was introduced for awake nasotracheal intubation recently. The aim of this study was to compare the cardiovascular responses and associated airway complications of fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) with those of BID. The intubation attempts and intubation time were also compared. Methods: Forty-one ASA grade I or II normotensive adult patients with difficult airways, requiring nasotracheal intubation for elective oral and maxillofacial or plastic surgery, were randomly assigned to intubation with either FOB (n = 21) or BID (n = 20). The cardiovascular values were invasively measured at specific time points. Postoperative airway complications were assessed using a questionnaire. Results: Nasotracheal intubation was successful in both groups (100%). After sedation, blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly compared with baseline values in both groups (P < 0.05). Compared with baseline or postsedation values, both devices led to significant increases in BP when we inserted the endotracheal tube or the oesophagus airway through the nasal cavity (P < 0.05), while heart rate did not change significantly. Passing the FOB or light-guided catheter through the vocal cord and advancing the endotracheal tube into the trachea caused significant increases in both BP and heart rate compared with baseline or postsedation values (P < 0.05). No significant difference in BP or heart rate between the two groups was found. The intubation time was similar (P = 0.13). Blood detected on the intubation devices was similar in both groups (P = 0.73). Nasal pain, sore throat and hoarseness observed after 24 h was also similar (P = 0.49, 0.36, 0.51, respectively). Conclusion: Both FOB and BID caused similarly slight cardiovascular responses during awake nasotracheal intubation in normotensive adults. The intubation-associated airway complications were similar.",0,0
10764002,Down syndrome: analysis of airway size and a guide for appropriate intubation,"Objectives/hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the airway size of children with Down syndrome (DS). Previous studies have observed an increase in postintubation stridor in children with DS. Anesthetic literature suggests using a smaller endotracheal tube in children with DS, but more specific recommendations are not offered. With this study, recommendations are presented for the appropriate endotracheal tube size to use in children with DS undergoing intubation. Study design: A prospective, nonrandomized study was performed on a cohort of 42 children with DS and 32 control subjects. Sizing of the airway was assessed through measurement of an air leak around the endotracheal tube at intubation. The size of the airway was also evaluated through measurements of the tracheal diameter at the ""tracheotomy point"" on magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) studies of the head and neck which were performed on a group of children with DS. These were compared with normative values of the tracheal diameter in children. Methods: The proper size of endotracheal tube in a population of children with DS and in a group of normal controls was determined. The ""proper size"" of an endotracheal tube was defined as that size of tube which allowed an audible air leak around the tube between 10 and 30 cm of H2O pressure. Anesthetic technique was controlled and identical for all study subjects. Participants had no previous history of airway compromise, stridor, or previous intubation. Weight and age were recorded and evaluated for their influence on the results. A retrospective evaluation was made of MRI studies of the neck that were performed on children with DS. Using measurement techniques described by Reed et al., the tracheal diameters at the ""tracheostomy point"" were compared with normative values for children. Measurements were both obtained by the author and confirmed by a pediatric radiologist. Results: Using this prescribed method to determine the proper size of endotracheal tube, the control group used endotracheal tubes that were predicted from established anesthesia charts and formulas. However, children with DS required endotracheal tubes at least two sizes smaller. Age was found to be a more reliable factor in predicting the endotracheal tube size. A table of endotracheal tube sizes for intubation in children with DS is presented. Evaluation of the tracheal diameter at the tracheotomy point revealed that children with DS have a smaller trachea when compared with control children. It is not only the subglottis that is smaller; the tracheal diameter as well must be assumed to be of a smaller diameter in children with DS. Conclusions: Children with DS have smaller airways than other children. This is because of an overall decrease in the diameter of the tracheal lumens. Initial intubation of a child with DS should be performed with an endotracheal tube at least two sizes smaller than would be used in a child of the same age without DS, to avert potential trauma to the airway.",0,0
11769999,Evaluation of clinical parameters in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and possible correlation with the severity of the disease,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a complex disease whose etiology is multifactorial and incompletely understood. This article focuses on upper airway anatomy evaluation and the standardization of different physical findings in patients with OSA and on the possible correlation of these physical findings with the severity of the disease. All patients underwent a physical examination and polysomnography. The physical examination included tonsil size, modified Mallampati grade, neck circumference, lateral clinical craniofacial assessment and body mass index (BMI). The study group consisted of 85 patients. A statistically significant correlation between tonsil size and BMI and with the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was detected (P = 0.004 and 0.03 respectively). Also patients with a craniofacial anomaly have a higher RDI level than the patients without this anomaly (P = 0.03). This study has identified some standardized physical findings for predicting the severity of OSA. We aim to benefit from these findings in the selection of a rational treatment modality selection for patients with OSA.",0,0

18677281,Endoscopic arytenoid lateropexy for isolated posterior glottic stenosis,"Objectives/hypothesis: A posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) may limit the abduction of the arytenoid cartilages. One option for the treatment of dyspnea in lower grade stenoses is endoscopic laterofixation of the vocal cords after scar excision. In our prospective study, we assess a refined method for effective endoscopic mobilization and lateropexy of the arytenoid cartilages. Study design and methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients with PGS underwent surgery. Endoscopically, the scar between the arytenoid cartilages was transected with a CO2 laser. The scars that had spread into the cricoarytenoid joint were transected with a right-angled endolaryngeal scythe designed for this purpose. The lateropexy of the adequately mobilized arytenoid cartilages was performed with a reinforced Lichtenberger's needle carrier instrument, with consideration of the real abduction of the cricoarytenoid joint. Results: Twenty-eight patients achieved an excellent breathing ability, only effort dyspnea remained in three cases. One patient could not be decannulated due to aspiration. The early postoperative improvement in the airway function test results showed no relationship with the grade of stenoses. However, in cases of higher grade stenoses with bilateral joint damage, the later postoperative airway function results had decreased slightly. In 25 cases, phonation significantly improved after the removal of the fixing sutures. Conclusions: After proper mobilization, endoscopic arytenoid lateropexy can be considered as a minimally invasive function-preserving procedure even for severe PGS. This treatment option provides stable improvements in breathing ability and good voice quality without the need for tracheostomy.",0,0
13680470,[Laser-based endoscopic measurement of airway dimensions],"Bronchoscopy is the technique of choice for the evaluation of a stenosis in the large airways. However, no system has been successfully employed for the bronchoscopic measurement of airway stenosis. The purpose of these study was the development and validation of a method for measuring the cross-sectional areas in the large airways. Furthermore, this application should be used for the 3D-reconstruction and visualisation of airway stenosis. A laser probe inserted into the operating channel of the bronchoscope enabled assessment of the distance between the images and the tip of the bronchoscope by means of projecting a ring of light on to the endoluminal wall. Image distortion due to the wide-angle lens was corrected by a computer program developed by us. Plastic tubes with known diameters were used for validation. Additionally, distortion-corrected bronchoscopic images were compared with distortion-free videoscopic image analysis of tracheal slices taken from pigs. When plastic tubes were used, the correlation coefficient (r) was slightly higher (r = 0,99, p < 0,01) than the correlation of cross-sectional areas between bronchoscopic and videoscopic images of tracheal slices (r = 0,88, p < 0,01). Furthermore the system could be used in a few patients for 2D and 3D measurement and visualisation of airway stenosis. Application of the present method offer quantitative assessment of airway stenosis located in the large airways.",0,0
24001719,Evaluation of paramedic utilization of the intubating laryngeal mask airway in high-fidelity simulated critical care scenarios,"Introduction: Successful oxygenation and ventilation can mean the difference between life and death in the prehospital setting. While airway challenges can be numerous within the confines of the emergency department, there are many additional confounding difficulties in the prehospital setting, which include limited access to equipment, poor lighting, extreme environments, limited personnel to assist, no immediate backup, and limited rescue airway options. The concept of an easy, reliable, and rapidly deployable alternative rescue airway device is critical, especially when considering the addition of rapid sequence intubation protocols in the prehospital setting. Hypothesis The primary objective of this study was to ascertain whether paramedics can be trained to deploy this alternative airway device with an acceptable success rate in a simulated critical care airway scenario. The secondary objective was to determine whether the previously-trained paramedics were able to retain their ability to deploy the device successfully at one year. Methods: This was a prospective, observational, single-group, descriptive cohort, educational trial. Forty paramedics were trained in the use of the Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway (I-LMA) in a simulation medicine curriculum culminating in a simulated critical care difficult airway scenario requiring urgent oxygenation and ventilation after failed traditional endotracheal intubation. An emergency medicine physician proctor determined successful airway management. Repeat testing was then performed at approximately one year out, challenging the medics to intubate a mannequin using the I-LMA during an unrelated training session. Results: Of the 40 paramedics who underwent complete simulation training, 39 were able to intubate and ventilate the simulated difficult airway using the I-LMA during the critical care scenario. This yields a success rate of 97.5% (95% CI, 87.1%-99.4%). At approximately one year out, 35 out of 35 medics were able to intubate the mannequin using the I-LMA, resulting in a success rate of 100% (95% CI, 91.4%-100%). Conclusions: In this study, paramedics were able to deploy the I-LMA with a high degree of success in a simulated difficult airway, with a high degree of skill retention at one year out.",0,0
11837148,Preinduction activities: a closed malpractice claims perspective,"The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists Foundation conducts an ongoing study of closed malpractice claims that involve nurse anesthetists. A team of 8 CRNA researchers has to date investigated 223 closed claim files from the St Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company. Research findings have demonstrated that failure to provide appropriate anesthesia care relative to the Scope and Standards for Nurse Anesthesia Practice was significantly associated with adverse anesthetic outcomes. Claims that involved inadequate preinduction activities (n = 22) were analyzed in the context of their compliance with published standards of care. The largest group of claims in this analysis (59%) involved damaging respiratory events, 28% entailed damaging cardiovascular events, and the principal issue in 13% of these claims involved failure to seek available information such as laboratory studies on the medical record. The most prevalent occurrence with damaging respiratory events was undocumented airway assessment in 27% of the claims. In 55% of these claims, the medical history was not completely documented. The surgical procedure categories were general surgical (32%), obstetrical (27%), otolaryngogical (23%), orthopedic (14%), and gynecologic (5%). The involved standards of care are reviewed, and recommendations are made regarding consistent completion of preinduction activities.",0,0

We report a patient with RP who showed progressive severe bronchial stenosis on three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) and impulse oscillation (IOS) with 3D color imaging using a Mostgraph®. The forced oscillation technique using IOS allows within-breath evaluation without forced expiration. A 68-year-old man who had RP presented with dyspnea due to stenosis of the trachea and left main bronchus (lt. mb). Stenting was performed twice in two years. Chest 3D-CT revealed a marked difference in the extent of bronchial collapse during expiration compared with inspiration. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0), reactance at 5Hz (X5), resonant frequency (Fres), and integrated low frequency reactance area (ALX) measured by IOS showed temporary improvement after placement of the first stent, but respiratory resistance at 5Hz (R5) and 20Hz (R20) remained poor. 3D color images of respiratory resistance obtained with a Mostgraph® already showed high values at the time of diagnosis, resembling the features of chronic obstructive disease (COPD). 3D color images were helpful for interpreting the changes of IOS parameters during the clinical course. In conclusion, 3D-CT in inspiration/expiration and noninvasive IOS with 3D color imaging are useful for assessing airway stenosis in RP while reducing the burden of repeated spirometry.",0,0
8470782,[A modified Macintosh blade for difficult intubation. The mirror blade],"Difficult intubations can occur in cases of anatomical or physiological abnormalities of the face and neck. They are frequently predictable when specific signs are evident preoperatively. There are still occasional unexpected difficulties during conventional laryngoscopy when common blades like the Macintosh and Foregger types are used. During the past 5 decades several authors have proposed many types of laryngoscopes and blades differing in length and shape, as well as various accessories such as guide-wires, prisms, and mirrors. METHOD. We modified a size 3 Macintosh blade by adding a mirror placed tangential to the external curve near the apex. This configuration allows both conventional direct visualisation of the vocal cords and non-direct viewing through the mirror. Insertion of the tube is facilitated using a specially shaped guide-wire. RESULTS. This equipment was used for orotracheal intubation in 20 patients with different degrees of direct laryngeal visibility prior to otolaryngologic endoscopy and surgery under general anaesthesia. Both methods of larynx visualisation were performed and compared. In 1 patient the mirror was not useful because it became fogged. In all the others we could avoid this problem by warming the blade in water. Only in 1 other case was the conventional view better and intubation seemed to be easier than when the mirror was used. In 15 patients the vocal cords were visualised better with the mirror, and intubation was performed by means of the guide-wire with the non-direct technique. In 2 of these cases difficult direct laryngoscopy of grades 3 and 4 according to the Cormack and Lehane classification was found. Four patients were difficult to intubate and neither type of laryngoscopy was ideal. It is notable that a satisfactory view was achieved in the mirror with much less effort. In particular, there was no need to introduce the blade as deeply or raise its apex as much as is usually done. CONCLUSION. The mirror-blade is a suitable device for management of unexpected difficult intubations. Because of its dual availability, it offers both direct and non-direct visualisation of the larynx. Handling of this mirror-blade can be practised extensively, which allows integration of this equipment in the ""failed intubation drill"". This should be an integral part of the teaching and training of anaesthesia personnel.",0,0
9389861,"Rapid tracheal intubation with propofol, alfentanil and a standard dose of vecuronium","We studied 60 ASA I patients with Mallampati grade 1 airways to compare emergency intubating conditions with either alfentanil 20 micrograms kg-1, propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 and vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1, or with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1 and suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1. Ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord status and cough response were graded. The trachea of all patients was intubated; 83% of patients in the alfentanil-propofol-vecuronium group and 86% in the thiopentone-suxamethonium group were considered to have satisfactory intubating conditions at 60 s. We conclude that the combination of alfentanil 20 micrograms kg-1, propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 and vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 provided adequate conditions for rapid tracheal intubation.",0,0
6732322,Cricothyroidotomy for long-term tracheal access. A prospective analysis of morbidity and mortality in 76 patients,"Cricothyroidotomy for long-term tracheal access was prospectively studied in 76 critically ill patients. Thirty patients (39%) survived and 46 (61%) died. Mean duration of follow-up computed in all survivors was 8.5 months. Postmortem examination of the airway was performed in 85% of the nonsurvivors. Five patients (7%) had major complications including one death, subglottic stenosis in two adolescent patients, reversible subglottic granulation with partial obstruction in one patient, and tracheomalacia in one patient. Minor complications occurred in 23 (30%) survivors. Eleven (28%) of the nonsurvivors examined post mortem had airway pathology, including ulceration, hemorrhage and abscess at the stoma or cuff site, subglottic erosion, and mucosal separation. There were no significant differences in any of the parameters studied between the group with and the group without airway pathology. The morbidity and mortality of cricothyroidotomy in adults are similar to that reported for tracheostomy. However, cricothyroidotomy should be avoided in children and adolescents because of the risk of subglottic stenosis.",0,0

24792012,High nasal resistance may be a result rather than a cause of obstructive sleep apnea,"Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) show high nasal resistance (NR). The present study tested the hypothesis that nasal obstruction in OSA patients could be caused by pharyngeal narrow. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) on NR in patients with OSA. Rhinomanometry was performed and the Mallampati score was recorded during wakefulness in a sitting position before and after UPPP for 33 patients with OSA. Thirty-three healthy volunteers were used as a control group. The NR in patients with OSA (0.37 ± 0.22 Pa/cm(3)/s) was significantly higher than that of the normal controls (0.19 ± 0.04 Pa/cm(3)/s) (p < 0.01). The NR decreased from 0.37 ± 0.22 to 0.20 ± 0.05 Pa/cm(3)/s (p < 0.01) after UPPP with the Mallampati score decreased from 3.00 ± 0.56 to 1.52 ± 0.57 (p < 0.01). However, NR values after UPPP were still higher than those of the control group, but there was no significant difference between those two groups (p = 0.34). The present study showed that the high NR may not be completely attributable to nasal anatomic obstruction, but may result from pharyngeal narrow in OSA. High NR may be a result of OSA rather than a cause.",0,0
26379966,Hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation performed with video and direct laryngoscopy in patients scheduled for major cardiac surgery,"This study aims to compare the hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation performed with direct and video laryngoscope in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery and to assess the airway and laryngoscopic characteristics. One hundred ten patients were equally allocated to either direct Macintosh laryngoscope (n = 55) or indirect Macintosh C-MAC video laryngoscope (n = 55). Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were recorded prior to induction anesthesia, and immediately and two minutes after intubation. Airway characteristics (modified Mallampati, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, mouth opening, upper lip bite test, Wilson risk sum score), mask ventilation, laryngoscopic characteristics (Cormack-Lehane, percentage of glottic opening), intubation time, number of attempts, external pressure application, use of stylet and predictors of difficult intubation (modified Mallampati grade 3-4, thyromental distance < 6 cm, upper lip bite test class 3, Wilson risk sum score ≥ 2, Cormack-Lehane grade 3-4) were recorded. Hemodynamic parameters were similar between the groups at all time points of measurement. Airway characteristics and mask ventilation were no significant between the groups. The C-MAC video laryngoscope group had better laryngoscopic view as assessed by Cormack-Lehane and percentage of glottic view, and a longer intubation time. Number of attempts, external pressure, use of stylet, and difficult intubation parameters were similar. Endotracheal intubation performed with direct Macintosh laryngoscope or indirect Macintosh C-MAC video laryngoscope causes similar and stable hemodynamic responses.",0,0
11377154,Laryngeal mask insertion during target-controlled infusion of propofol,"Study objective: To compare the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA; The Laryngeal Mask Airway Co., Ltd., Nicosia, Cyprus) insertion conditions produced by 6 and 8 microg/mL of target plasma concentrations (Cpt) during the induction of anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. Design: Randomized, prospective, single-blind, clinical study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: 44 ASA physical status I and II patients, 16 to 54 years of age, weighing between 45 and 100 kg, undergoing minor surgery in which the use of LMA was indicated. Interventions: Patients were randomly divided into two groups (1 and 2) of 22 to compare the effects of different propofol concentrations. Three minutes after intravenous (IV) injection of midazolam 0.04 mg/kg, group 1 and 2 received TCI of propofol with 6 and 8 microg/mL of Cpt, respectively. LMA was inserted when the effect-site concentration (EC) reached 2.5 microg/mL, which was displayed on the infusion pump. Measurements: The LMA insertion conditions (mouth opening, gagging, coughing, head or limb movement, laryngospasm, overall ease of insertion) were assessed, and hemodynamic responses were evaluated until 3 minutes after LMA insertion. Total dose of propofol, EC, and elapsed time since the start of TCI were recorded at five times: at the loss of consciousness and eyelash reflex, at 2.5 microg/mL of EC, and immediately, 1 minute, and 3 minutes after the insertion of LMA. Main results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in insertion conditions, despite the significantly larger total dose and shorter elapsed time (2.6 +/- 0.08 mg/kg and 109 +/- 5.0 s) in Group 2 than those (2.1 +/- 0.02 mg/kg and 140 +/- 4.1 s) in Group 1 at 2.5 microg/mL of EC (p < 0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased significantly throughout the study period in both groups (p < 0.05). But there was a significant decrease in arterial pressure in Group 2 compared with Group 1 1 and 3 minutes after the insertion (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Induction with 8 microg/mL of Cpt, compared with 6 microg/mL, allowed earlier LMA insertion but, could not improve the conditions for LMA insertion and required more careful attention to the decrease in blood pressure after LMA insertion.",0,0
18211450,Evaluation of the Airtraq and Macintosh laryngoscopes in patients at increased risk for difficult tracheal intubation,"The Airtraq, a novel single use indirect laryngoscope, has demonstrated promise in the normal and simulated difficult airway. We compared the ease of intubation using the Airtraq with the Macintosh laryngoscope, in patients at increased risk for difficult tracheal intubation, in a randomised, controlled clinical trial. Forty consenting patients presenting for surgery requiring tracheal intubation, who were deemed to possess at least three characteristics indicating an increased risk for difficulty in tracheal intubation, were randomly assigned to undergo tracheal intubation using a Macintosh (n = 20) or Airtraq (n = 20) laryngoscope. All patients were intubated by one of three anaesthetists experienced in the use of both laryngoscopes. Four patients were not successfully intubated with the Macintosh laryngoscope, but were intubated successfully with the Airtraq. The Airtraq reduced the duration of intubation attempts (mean (SD); 13.4 (6.3) vs 47.7 (8.5) s), the need for additional manoeuvres, and the intubation difficulty score (0.4 (0.8) vs 7.7 (3.0)). Tracheal intubation with the Airtraq also reduced the degree of haemodynamic stimulation and minor trauma compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope.",0,0
25197109,Effect of rigid cervical collar on tracheal intubation using Airtraq(®),"Background and aims: Cervical spine immobilisation with rigid cervical collar imposes difficulty in intubation. Removal of the anterior part of the collar may jeopardize the safety of the cervical spine. The effect of restricted mouth opening and cervical spine immobilisation that result from the application of rigid cervical collar on intubation using Airtraq(®) was evaluated. Methods: Seventy healthy adults with normal airways included in the study were intubated Using Airtraq® with (group C) and without rigid cervical collar (group NC). The ease of insertion of Airtraq(®) into the oral cavity, intubation time, intubation difficulty score (IDS) were compared using Wilcoxon sign ranked test and McNemar test, using SPSS version 13. Results: Intubation using Airtraq(®) was successful in the presence of the cervical collar in 96% which was comparable to group without collar (P = 0.24). The restriction of mouth opening resulted in mild difficulty in insertion of Airtraq(®). The median Likert scale for insertion was - 1 in the group C and + 1 in group NC (P < 0.001). The intubation time was longer in group C (30 ± 14.3 s vs. 26.9 ± 14.8 s) compared to group NC. The need for adjusting manoeuvres was 18.5% in group C versus 6.2% in group NC (P = 0.003) and bougie was required in 12 (18.5%) and 4 (6.2%) patients in group C and NC, respectively, to facilitate intubation (P = 0.02). The modified IDS score was higher in group C but there was no difference in the number of patients with IDS < 2. Conclusion: Tracheal intubation using Airtraq(®) in the presence of rigid cervical collar has equivalent success rate, acceptable difficulty in insertion and mild increase in IDS.",0,0
25961111,Airway Remodeling in Preschool Children with Severe Recurrent Wheeze,"Rationale: Airway wall structure in preschoolers with severe recurrent wheeze is poorly described. Objectives: To describe airway wall structure and inflammation in preschoolers with severe recurrent wheeze. Methods: Flexible bronchoscopy was performed in two groups of preschoolers with severe recurrent wheeze: group 1, less than or equal to 36 months (n = 20); group 2, 36-59 months (n = 29). We assessed airway inflammation, reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickness, airway smooth muscle (ASM), mucus gland area, vascularity, and epithelial integrity. Comparisons were then made with biopsies from 21 previously described schoolchildren with severe asthma (group 3, 5-11.2 yr). Measurements and main results: RBM thickness was lower in group 1 than in group 2 (3.3 vs. 3.9 μm; P = 0.02), was correlated with age (P < 0.01; ρ = 0.62), and was higher in schoolchildren than in preschoolers (6.8 vs. 3.8 μm; P < 0.01). ASM area was lower in preschoolers than in schoolchildren (9.8% vs. 16.5%; P < 0.01). Vascularity was higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P = 0.02) and group 3 (P < 0.05). Mucus gland area was higher in preschoolers than in schoolchildren (16.4% vs. 4.6%; P < 0.01). Inflammatory cell counts in biopsies were not correlated with airway wall structure. ASM area was higher in preschoolers with atopy than without atopy (13.1% vs. 7.7%; P = 0.01). Airway morphometrics and inflammation were similar in viral and multiple-trigger wheezers. Conclusions: In preschoolers with severe recurrent wheeze, markers of remodeling and inflammation are unrelated, and atopy is associated with ASM. In the absence of control subjects, we cannot determine whether differences observed in RBM thickness and vascularity result from disease or normal age-related development.",0,0
23322629,Diagnostic value of the Friedman tongue position and Mallampati classification for obstructive sleep apnea: a meta-analysis,"Objective: To assess the association between the Mallampati classification and Friedman tongue position for obstructive sleep apnea severity as determined by apnea-hypopnea index and to determine which method is most closely correlated with prediction of obstructive sleep apnea severity. Data sources: English-language searches of PubMed, MedLine, and the Cochrane database. Reference sections of identified studies were examined for additional articles. Review methods: Databases through December 2011 were searched, combined with review of relevant article bibliographies, and assessed by 4 reviewers. Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of studies evaluating tongue position and obstructive sleep apnea severity were performed. Outcomes were reported as correlations. Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria and had data for pooling (2513 patients). Friedman tongue position and Mallampati classification were significantly associated with obstructive sleep apnea severity, with a correlation of 0.351 (0.094-0.564, P = .008). Analysis of the correlation of tongue position with obstructive sleep apnea severity reveals correlations of 0.184 (0.052, 0.310, P = .006) and 0.388 (0.049, 0.646, P = .026) for the Mallampati classification and Friedman tongue position, respectively. Publication bias does not yield a significant Egger regression intercept; however, 4 imputed values to the right of the mean were found using Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill method, yielding an overall correlation of 0.498 (confidence interval = 0.474-0.521). Conclusion: The Mallampati classification and Friedman tongue position assessment techniques are significantly correlated with predicting obstructive sleep apnea severity. Publication bias does not significantly affect our results. The strength of this correlation is higher for Friedman tongue position, although 95% confidence intervals for the respective correlation coefficients overlap.",0,0
25007691,General anesthesia in cesarean sections: a prospective review of 465 cesarean sections performed under general anesthesia,"Background: In many countries, neuraxial blocks comprise the majority of anesthetics given for cesarean section. In Iran, however general anesthesia for cesarean section is prevalent. In our institution, the rate of general anesthesia for cesarean section is 39%, providing an opportunity to collect data regarding airway management in the parturients. We report on the outcomes of a series of patients who received general anesthesia for cesarean section. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in two university hospitals, with approximately 5,500 deliveries annually. Demographics and airway characteristics were recorded. Eight potential risk factors for difficult intubation (short neck, obesity, facial edema, swollen tongue, receding mandible, and single, missing or protruding maxillary incisors) were analyzed. Then, laryngoscopic view, difficulty at intubation, and major complications were recorded. Results: Data were obtained from 465 patients. There was a significant correlation between higher Mallampati score and both higher laryngoscopic view graded on the Cormack-Lehane system (P < 0.001) and difficulty at intubation (P-Value = 0.05). Emergency cesarean section was not associated with difficult intubation (P = 0.67). Multivariate analysis showed that receding mandible was the only potential risk factor for difficult tracheal intubation (P < 0.001) and removed short neck or protruding maxillary incisor which initially was powered as a risk factor by univariate analysis. A grade 3 laryngoscopic view was obtained in 15 cases (3.2%). There was no case of grade 4 view. There was only one failed intubation (0.2%), and 9 cases of very difficult intubation (1.9%). Conclusion: General anesthesia for cesarean section is safe with minimal risk.",0,0

17527116,MDCT of the central airways: comparison with bronchoscopy in the evaluation of complications of endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes,"Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) compared with bronchoscopy in the assessment of airway complications related to endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes. Materials and methods: A review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy for symptomatic complications of endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes during an 18-month period. MDCT imaging was performed according to a standard protocol and interpreted by an experienced thoracic radiologist before bronchoscopy. After bronchoscopy by an experienced interventional pulmonologist, CT and bronchoscopic findings were reviewed jointly, and the accuracy of CT was determined using bronchoscopy as the ""gold standard."" Results: The study population was comprised of 32 patients (range: 26 to 88 y, mean 55.6) with a total of 47 airway complications: tracheal stenosis (n=25), tracheomalacia (n=8), tracheal granulation tissue (n=8), tracheal cartilage fracture (n=4), tracheal perforation (n=1), and tracheostomy tube disruption (n=1). CT accurately diagnosed 42 of 47 airway complications (sensitivity 89.4%, specificity 95.2%, positive predictive value 85.7%, negative predictive value 96.5%). False negative findings at CT occurred in 5 (11.1%) of 47 cases. Contributing technical factors were identified in 3 (60.0%) of 5 false-negative cases, including the presence of tracheostomy tube during imaging and patient inability to complete the CT protocol. Conclusions: MDCT of the central airways is highly accurate for detecting symptomatic airway complications of endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes, particularly when technical limitations to the performance of CT are minimized.",0,0
23192587,Decomposition of polychlorinated biphenyls in soil with a dispersion mixture of metallic calcium and calcium oxide,"This study describes the decomposition of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil with dispersion mixtures of metallic calcium (Ca) and calcium oxide (CaO) at different temperatures. In these experiments, naturally moisturized and contaminated soil (1.0 g [31 ppm PCBs]), CaO (dried 2.0 wt%), and metallic Ca (0.01 g [0.25 mmol]) were introduced into a stainless steel pressure reactor under 0.1 MPa N(2) gas. The mixtures were stirred magnetically and heated at 260, 280, and 300 °C, respectively. Soil treatment with metallic Ca and CaO under various temperature conditions is extremely effective for degrading existing PCBs. Decomposition resulted from dechlorination (DC). Initial moisture in soil acted as a hydrogen source during stirring. Soil moisture can be beneficial for hydrodechlorination in the presence of metallic Ca and CaO. Furthermore, metallic Ca and CaO can greatly increase the number of collisions and mutual refinement. Treatment at 260, 280, and 300 °C combined with metallic Ca and CaO is effective for the decomposition (approximately 95 % DC) of PCBs in soil under natural moisture conditions.",0,0
7486037,Laryngeal mask airway positioning is related to Mallampati grading in adults,"The Mallampati classification is a commonly used means of preoperatively predicting a difficult endotracheal intubation. As the laryngeal portion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) must sit over the larynx, we wondered whether the Mallampati classification also predicts difficulty in achieving adequate seating of the LMA. LMA positioning was assessed prospectively in 100 adult patients by fiberoptic bronchoscopy to determine whether there was a relationship between the ease of seating of the LMA and the Mallampati classification. In 72 patients, optimal seating of the LMA was achieved on the first attempt at insertion, and all these patients were classified as Mallampati class 1 or 2. In all 28 cases of difficulty with LMA insertion, the patients were Mallampati class 2 or 3. In two cases the LMA was abandoned, and in these cases both patients were Mallampati class 3, (P = 0.0001 by chi 2 analysis). We conclude that the Mallampati classification indicates difficulty not only in tracheal intubation but also in achieving an adequate airway with the LMA.",0,0

25249430,Lingual traction to facilitate fiber-optic intubation of difficult airways: a single-anesthesiologist randomized trial,"Purpose: Flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope-guided orotracheal intubation is a valuable technique with demonstrated benefits in the management of difficult airways. Despite its popularity with anesthesia providers, the technique is not fail-safe and airway-related complications secondary to failed intubation attempts remain an important problem. We sought to determine the effect of incorporating lingual traction on the success rate of fiber-optic bronchoscope-guided intubation in patients with anticipated difficult airways. Methods: In this prospective, randomized, cohort study, we enrolled 91 adult patients with anticipated difficult airways scheduled for elective surgery to undergo fiber-optic bronchoscope-guided orotracheal intubation alone or with lingual traction by an individual anesthesiologist after induction of general anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade. A total of 78 patients were randomized: 39 patients to the fiber-optic bronchoscope-guided intubation with lingual traction group and 39 patients to the fiber-optic bronchoscope-guided intubation alone group. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful first attempt intubations. The secondary outcome was sore throat grade on post-operative day 1. Results: Fiber-optic intubation with lingual traction compared to fiber-optic intubation alone resulted in a higher success rate (92.3 vs. 74.4 %, χ (2) = 4.523, p = 0.033) and greater odds for successful first attempt intubation (OR 4.138, 95 % CI 1.041-16.444, p = 0.044). Sore throat severity on post-operative day 1 was not significantly different but trended towards worsening grades with lingual traction. Conclusions: In this study, lingual traction was shown to be a valuable maneuver for facilitating fiber-optic bronchoscope-guided intubation in the management of patients with anticipated difficult airways.",0,0
8873556,Prevention of lidocaine aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction with intravenous lidocaine,"Background: Lidocaine applied topically provokes bronchoconstriction in persons with hyperreactive airway disease. The authors questioned whether intravenous lidocaine would prevent lidocaine-aerosol induced bronchoconstriction. They compared the effects of lidocaine administered intravenously and by the aerosol route on baseline airway tone, and on the prevention of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in five Basenji-Greyhound dogs. Methods: Dogs were pretreated with either intravenous or aerosol lidocaine followed by histamine aerosol challenge. On separate days, dogs were pretreated with intravenous lidocaine, followed by aerosol lidocaine administration at similar doses. Airway caliber was assessed using high-resolution computed tomography. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. Serum lidocaine concentrations were obtained. Results: Histamine alone decreased the airway area by 32 +/- 3%. Lidocaine administered intravenously or by the aerosol route significantly inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. There was no significant difference between the two routes in preventing histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. At the dose that inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, lidocaine administered by the aerosol route decreased baseline airway area by 27 +/- 3% (P < 0.01), whereas intravenous lidocaine had no effect. Intravenous lidocaine prevented lidocaine aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction, and the combination of intravenous and aerosol lidocaine significantly dilated the airways by 20 +/- 5% (P < 0.01 compared with control). Conclusions: An intravenous bolus of lidocaine prevents the initial bronchoconstriction induced by lidocaine when administered as an aerosol.",0,0

16756050,Disposable laryngeal mask airway (Soft Seal) for endotracheal intubation: FOB guidance technique and blind technique,"Objective: To evaluate disposable LMA for endotracheal intubation using the FOB guidance and blind techniques. Material and method: The authors included ASA class I-II patients between 15 and 60 years of age, with mouth opening more than 3 cm, scheduled for elective surgery. The authors excluded patients with any history of gastro-esophageal reflux, full stomach or a body weight < 30 kg. All of the patients received standard general anesthesia. After inducing anesthesia, a disposable LMA No. 3 or No. 4 (Soft Seal, Smiths Medical, Portex Inc, USA) was inserted while the patient was in the sniff position. The authors recorded the insertion time, the ease of insertion, the anatomic placement and position. The authors then inserted a flexible endotracheal tube (No. 6.5 for LMA No. 4 and No. 6 for LMA No. 3) and recorded the success rate and the ease of insertion. After three failures, the authors used FOB guidance. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled (32 males). The mean +/- SD age and BMI was 43.2 +/- 13.4 years and 22.6 +/- 3.9, respectively. Most of the patients had a Mallampati of grade I. The mean +/- SD insertion time was 24.6 +/- 16.1 sec. After the FOB evaluation, only 27 patients had an anatomic placement in full view of the glottis. Eighteen patients had vocal cords in the middle part of the opening. The success rate of blind endotracheal intubation was 5 percent (95%CI 1.0-13.9) (3/60); while the success rate with FOB guidance was 85 percent (95%CI 73.4-92.9). Conclusion: A disposable laryngeal mask airway (Soft Seal) for blind endotracheal intubation had a low success rate, but it could be used more successfully with FOB guidance.",0,0
12351303,Difficult endotracheal intubation in patients with sleep apnea syndrome,"Although sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is common, studies assessing the anesthetic management of these patients are rare and consist mainly of case studies. We performed a retrospective case-control study to determine the incidence of difficult intubation in SAS patients and to determine the relationship between the severity of SAS and the occurrence of difficult intubation. Among 113 patients included (36 and 77 in the SAS and control groups, respectively), difficult intubation occurred more often in SAS patients than in controls (21.9% versus 2.6%, respectively; P < 0.05). No relationship was found between the severity of SAS and the occurrence of difficult intubation. Disappointingly, no single factor was associated with the occurrence of difficult intubation in SAS patients. We conclude that SAS is a risk factor for difficult intubation. Implications: Because patients with sleep apnea syndrome have an increased risk of difficult endotracheal intubation and may present with cardiovascular disease, preoperative preventive measures should be undertaken to avoid untoward events.",0,1
18931235,Emergency airway management with fiberoptic intubation in the prone position with a fixed flexed neck,"We describe emergency airway management with fiberoptic intubation in a patient in the prone position with her neck flexed by a head pin holder during a neurosurgical procedure. Laryngeal mask airway is suggested in emergency difficult airway algorithms; however, this was not feasible in this patient because of her edematous upper airway and limited mouth opening resulting from extreme neck flexion by a head pin holder. The case illustrates the role of fiberoptic intubation in emergency airway management in this critical situation. Maneuvers to facilitate fiberoptic technique are also described.",0,0
20486579,[Tracheal intubation in patients with Williams syndrome],"Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from chromosome 7, including the elastin gene. Affected individuals frequently have connective tissue disorders and skeletal hypoplasia, resulting in micrognathia and mandibular retrusion. These conditions hinder adequate visualization of the larynx and render intubation difficult. We used different methods of tracheal intubation for two patients with Williams syndrome. The first case was a 35-year-old woman with micrognathia, mandibular retrusion, and a Mallampati class III airway, scheduled for mitral valve replacement. She had a three fingerbreadth oral aperture, 3.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. Since she had previously been successfully intubated at age 18 for patch enlargement of the aorta and extended aortoplasty, we elected to use intravenous anesthetic agents for this intubation. After administration of diazepam and fentanyl, mask ventilation was difficult and the direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack grade IV. Fortunately, blind orotracheal intubation using a Mallinckrodt tracheal tube with direct laryngoscopy was accomplished on the first attempt. The second case was a 71-year-old woman with micrognathia, slight mandibular retrusion, macroglossia, and a Mallampati class IV airway, scheduled for sigmoidectomy and insertion of a ureteral stent. She had a 2.5 fingerbreadth oral aperture, 4.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. From our experience with the first patient, we expected difficult ventilation and intubation. After 8% lidocaine spray to the larynx, and then 4% lidocaine spray to the vocal cords and trachea using a bronchoscope, we accomplished awake, fibreoptic-guided orotracheal intubation easily and quickly on the first attempt using a Parker Flex-Tip tube. Difficult tracheal intubation should be anticipated in Williams syndrome patients. Awake, fibreoptic-guided technique is easier and safer than direct laryngoscopy for intubating such patients.",0,0
24829737,Comparison of three methods in improving bag mask ventilation,"Introduction: Increasedlife expectancy in populations has brought along specific new scenarios in the fields of medicine for the elderly; prevalence of physical complications such as edentulism and patients with dentures is growing. Management of anesthesia and ventilation in this group of patients has turned into a great challenge. Some researchers suggest dentures to be left in place during bag-mask ventilation; yet, no unanimous agreement exists in this regard. Methods: In a single blind randomized clinical trial, we studied 300 patients with ASA class I, II (American Society of Anesthesiologists), Mallampati class (I, II) and aged over 55 years in three groups. After induction of anesthesia, in group G dentures were removed and in each buccal space an eight-layer 10 × 10 cm gauze and an oral airway were placed. In group D, the dentures and an oral airway were left in place. In group C (control), after removing dentures just an appropriate oral airway was placed. Then, each three group underwent bag-mask ventilation. Success of bag-mask ventilation (BMV) was considered as increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide to more than 20 mmHg and back to baseline with fresh gas flow of 3 L/min and adjustable pressure limiting valve pressure of 20 cm H2O. Success rates were evaluated between groups. Results: Effective BMV was possible in 91 (91%), 64 (64%) and 41 (41%) patients in groups G, D and C respectively. The differences were statistically significant. Successful BMV rate was significantly higher in female patients in group G compared to group C; 43/44 versus 25/46 individuals, P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 0.03, 95% confidence interval (0.00, 0.22). Conclusions: Leaving dentures in place in edentulous patients after inducing anesthesia improves bag-mask ventilation. However, placing folded compressed gauze in buccal space leads to more significant improvement in BMV compared to leaving dentures in place.",0,0

Carbon dioxide monitoring through LMA proved effective to assess airway patency during positioning for central vein puncture. In this syndrome, where a potentially difficult airway may be encountered, LMA allowed adequate ventilation, avoiding the risk and inconvenience of tracheal intubation.",0,0
11818189,Automatic axis generation for virtual bronchoscopic assessment of major airway obstructions,"Virtual bronchoscopy (VB) has emerged as a paradigm for more effective 3D CT image evaluation. Systematic evaluation of a 3D CT chest image using VB techniques, however, requires precomputed guidance data. This guidance data takes the form of central axes, or centerlines, through the major airways. We propose an axes-generation algorithm for VB assessment of 3D CT chest images. For a typical high-resolution 3D CT chest image, the algorithm produces a series of airway-tree axes, corresponding airway cross-sectional area measurements, and a segmented airway tree in a few minutes on a standard PC. Results for phantom and human airway-obstruction cases demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm. Also, the algorithm is demonstrated in the context of VB-based 3D CT assessment.",0,0
26403754,[Logistic regression analysis of the risk factors for difficult airway and the cut-off value of height-to-thyromental distance ratio],"Objective: To analyze the risk factors for difficult airway in laryngoscopy and mask ventilation. Methods: A total of 300 patients receiving general anesthesia with tracheal intubation were examined preoperatively for height, thyromental and sternomental distance (TMD), range of neck movement, inter-incisor distance, and modified Mallampati class. Intubation Difficult Score was used to identify a difficult laryngoscopy. Difficult airway was defined as either difficult laryngoscopy or difficult mask ventilation. The association between the airway characteristics and difficult airway was analyzed by logistic regression analysis, and the cut-off values for the height-to-TMD ratio was determined by the ROC curve. Results and conclusion: Eight airway characteristics were identified to contribute to a difficult airway, including (OR [95%CI]) the height-to-TMD ratio (3.58[1.95-8.46]), modified Mallampati class (3.34 [1.82-7.14]), BMI (3.07 [1.64-6.69]), history of a previous difficult airway (2.79 [1.28-5.25]), a thick neck (2.15 [1.04-4.37]), range of neck movement (1.98 [0.96-3.89]), sternomental and angulus mandibulae distance (1.46 [0.67-3.04]), and inter-incisor distance (1.01 [0.49-2.54]). The optimal cut-off value for the height-to-TMD ratio was 22.8 for predicting a difficult airway.",0,0
23239157,Association of large-airway lymphocytic bronchitis with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome,"Rationale: Lung transplantation offers great promise for otherwise terminal lung diseases, but the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) continues to limit survival. Although acute rejection and lymphocytic bronchiolitis have been identified as risk factors for the development of BOS, it is unclear whether large-airway lymphocytic inflammation conveys the same risk. Objectives: We evaluated lymphocytic bronchitis on endobronchial biopsies as a risk factor for BOS and mortality. Methods: Endobronchial biopsies were collected and graded during surveillance after lung transplantation. We assessed samples with negative cultures collected in the first 90 days from 298 subjects and compared large-airway lymphocytic bronchitis assessed by a 0-2 ""E-score"" and with standard A and BR pathology scores for acute rejection and small-airway lymphocytic bronchiolitis, respectively. Measurements and main results: We found surprisingly little association between large- and small-airway lymphocytic inflammation scores from a given bronchoscopy. Endobronchial lymphocytic bronchitis was more prevalent in subjects in BOS stage 0p and BOS stages 1-3 at the time of biopsy. Within 90 days after transplantation, increasing maximum E-score was associated with greater risk of BOS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.78; P = 0.02) and in this analysis 90-day maximum E-scores were the only score type predictive of BOS (P < 0.01). Conclusions: These results support a multicenter study to evaluate endoscopic biopsies for the identification of patients at increased risk for BOS. The association of endobronchial lymphocytic inflammation and BOS may have mechanistic implications.",0,0
9842832,A comparison of pharyngeal mucosal pressure and airway sealing pressure with the laryngeal mask airway in anesthetized adult patients,"We measured pharyngeal mucosal pressures at six different locations on the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and tested the hypothesis that the efficacy of the seal is not related to pharyngeal mucosal pressure. Twenty anesthetized, paralyzed adult patients were studied. Microchip sensors were attached to the size 5 LMA at locations corresponding to the lateral and posterior pharynx, the hypopharynx, the pyriform fossa, the base of tongue, and the oropharynx. Mucosal pressures and airway sealing pressures were recorded during inflation of the cuff from 0 to 40 mL in 10-mL increments. The highest mean mucosal pressure was in the oropharynx (26 cm H2O), and the lowest was in the posterior pharynx (2 cm H2O). Mucosal pressures increased with increasing intracuff pressure and cuff volume, but the rate of increase varied among locations. Airway sealing pressure increased with increasing intracuff volume from 0 to 10 mL (P < 0.0001) and 10 to 20 mL (P = 0.0001), was unchanged from 20 to 30 mL, and decreased from 30 to 40 mL (P = 0.005). The airway sealing pressure was higher than pharyngeal mucosal pressure until the intracuff volume was > or =30 mL. There was no correlation between mucosal pressures and airway sealing pressure at any location. We conclude that the efficacy of the seal is not related to pharyngeal mucosal pressure. Pharyngeal mucosal pressures are generally lower than those considered safe for the tracheal mucosa during prolonged intubation. Implications: We measured pharyngeal mucosal pressures at six different locations on the laryngeal mask airway and showed that the efficacy of the seal is not related to pharyngeal mucosal pressure. Pharyngeal mucosal pressures are generally lower than those considered safe for the tracheal mucosa during prolonged intubation.",0,0
19234820,Left-molar approach for direct laryngoscopy: is it easy?,"Purpose: For direct laryngoscopy, we compared midline and left-molar approaches with respect to ease of intubation, using a Macintosh blade. We investigated the relationship between failure of the left-molar approach and preoperative risk factors for difficult intubation. Methods: With local ethics committee approval, 200 consecutive adult, nonpregnant patients were included in the study. The demographic data, body mass index, Mallampati modified score, interincisor gap, and mentohyoid and thyromental distances were measured preoperatively. First, the Macintosh blade was inserted using the midline approach, and then optimal external laryngeal manipulation (OELM) was applied. Second, the blade was inserted using the left-molar approach. The glottic views were assessed according to the Cormack-Lehane classification before and after OELM in both approaches. In cases where tracheal intubation failed with the left-molar approach, the midline approach was applied again and endotracheal intubation took place. Results: The grade I glottic view obtained using the midline approach without OELM did not change in 94.3% of the patients with the left-molar approach without OELM; in addition, the grade II glottic view improved to grade I in 52.8% of the patients with the same technique (P < 0.001). Although the number of patients with a grade I or II glottic view in the left-molar approach was 197, only 37 patients could be intubated using the left-molar approach. In addition, 59.5% of them were intubated at the second attempt with the left-molar approach, while the incidence of a second attempt was 1.2% with the midline approach (P < 0.001). There was no correlation between the preoperative risk factors for difficult intubation and failure of the left-molar approach. Conclusion: Difficulty in the insertion of the endotracheal tube limits the efficacy of the left-molar approach. It is not possible to predict the failure of intubation with the left-molar approach by considering the preoperative risk factors.",0,0

26527904,A pilot study: portable out-of-center sleep testing as an early sleep apnea screening tool in acute ischemic stroke,"Introduction: Prompt diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is critical for optimal clinical outcomes, but in-laboratory conventional polysomnograms (PSG) are not routinely practical. Though portable out-of-center type III cardiopulmonary sleep studies (out-of-center cardiopulmonary sleep testing [OCST]) are widely available, these studies have not been validated in patients who have recently suffered from AIS. We hypothesized that OCST in patients with AIS would yield similar results when compared to conventional PSG. Methods: Patients with AIS had simultaneous type III OCST and PSG studies performed within 72 hours from symptom onset. The accuracy of OCST was compared to PSG using: chi-square tests, receiver operatory characteristic curves, Bland-Altman plot, paired Student's t-test/Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: Twenty-one out of 23 subjects with AIS (age 61±9.4 years; 52% male; 58% African-American) successfully completed both studies (9% technical failure). Nearly all (95%) had Mallampati IV posterior oropharynx; the mean neck circumference was 16.8±1.6 in. and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 30±7 kg/m(2). The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) provided by OCST was similar to that provided by PSG (19.8±18.0 vs 22.0±22.7, respectively; P=0.49). On identifying subjects by OCST with an AHI ≥5 on PSG, OCST had the following parameters: sensitivity 100%, specificity 85.7%, PPV 93%, and NPV 100%. On identifying subjects with an AHI ≥15 on PSG, OCST parameters were as follows: sensitivity 100%, specificity 83.3%, PPV 81.8%, and NPV 100%. Bland-Altman plotting showed an overall diagnostic agreement between OCST and PSG modalities for an AHI cutoff >5, despite fine-grained differences in estimated AHIs. Conclusion: Compared with PSG, OCST provides similar diagnostic information when run simultaneously in AIS patients. OCST is a reliable screening tool for early diagnosis of OSA in AIS patients.",0,0
23138584,Impact and workload implications on service provision with establishment of a neonatal complex airway service in Scotland,"The objective of this study was to assess if any changes have occurred in the utilization of neonatal services with referral for neonatal airway assessment and how this is related to the establishment of a National Complex Airway Service. A retrospective case-note review was performed for neonates referred for airway assessment from 2004-2010 inclusive. Seventy-nine neonates were referred from throughout Scotland; 10 in 2004-2006, 24 in 2007-2008 and 45 in 2009-2010. The mean gestational age was 35 weeks; 39% were preterm. Stridor was the most common reason for referral (46%). The most common diagnosis was airway malacia (38%). Fifty-three procedures were performed on the ward. In total, 64 microlaryngobronchoscopies were performed; 45 diagnostic and 19 interventional. The most common intervention was supraglottoplasty for airway malacia. Thirty-five separate airway procedures were undertaken. Additional investigations were frequently requested and co-morbidities were common. Since the establishment of the Scottish National Complex Airway Service in 2006, referrals for neonatal airway assessment have increased significantly. The reasons for this include a greater awareness of the service, improved treatment options and increased preterm survival. These neonates frequently have associated co-morbidities and require a repertoire of specialist input. This increase has significant implications for further service provision.",0,0
16200530,Method development and validation for the analysis of didanosine using micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography,"A selective MEKC method was developed for the analysis of didanosine in bulk samples. Successful separation of didanosine from 13 of its potential impurities, derived from the various synthetic preparation procedures, was achieved. As CZE gave poor separation selectivity, MEKC was preferable. The use of EKC allowed achievement of the separation in a significantly shorter time than conventional HPLC. An anionic long-chain surfactant, lithium dodecyl sulfate (LiDS), was used as the pseudostationary phase and sodium tetraborate buffer as the aqueous phase. In order to obtain the optimal conditions and to test the method robustness, a central composite response surface modeling experiment was performed. The optimized electrophoretic conditions include the use of an uncoated fused-silica capillary with a total length of 40 cm and an ID of 50 microm, a BGE containing 40 mM sodium tetraborate and 110 mM LiDS at pH 8.0, an applied voltage of 18.0 kV, and the capillary temperature maintained at 15 degrees C. The method was found to be robust. The parameters for validation such as linearity, precision, and sensitivity are also reported. Three commercial bulk samples were analyzed with this system.",0,0
16240921,[Clinical evaluation of the patient with a chronic snoring disease],"Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing patients usually undergo an ENT clinical examination before any therapeutic decision is taker. This clinical examination should be predictive about the occurrence of OSAS, reproductible and should determine the sites of obstruction in the upper airways. We have evaluated the clinical ENT examination and compared it with the bibliography in order to standardize it. Materials and methods: We have done the same clinical ENT examination to 181 patients. 127 had a standar polysomnography. Results: The patient's mean age was 49.6 years, the mean BMI was 29.3 kg/m2. 92.7% had an abnormal palate, 4.5% a tonsilar hipertrophy, 66.5% high Modified Mallampati scores, 60.8% were clasiffied as Fujita IIb type and 39.2% had nasal obstruction. Conclusions: Upper airway examination is important for the assessment of chronic snoring patients. Most of them have anatomical alterations that can be represented in visual scales to make it more reproductible. The obstruction area does not predict the severity of OSAS.",0,0
2800982,Magnetic resonance imaging--a useful tool for airway assessment,"The case is presented of a 58-year old man with a malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the root of the tongue. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proved extremely useful in the evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract, by providing sagittal sections of the hypopharynx and the inlet of the larynx. Thus, a potentially difficult intubation was confirmed in a patient in whom other investigations would not have produced comparable conclusions. Difficulties in airway management were avoided by performing a tracheostomy under local anesthesia. This represents a novel application of MRI, which might contribute to the safety of airway management.",0,0
7486294,[Cervicofacial cellulitis of dental origin and tracheal intubation],"Objectives: To evaluate the difficulty of intubation in relation with the localisation and spread of cervico-facial cellulitis of odontogenic origin and to recognize the optimal technique of intubation in such circumstances. Study design: Prospective clinical open study. Patients: Hundred patients, including 16 children, undergoing surgical drainage of a cervico-facial cellulitis of odontogenic origin under general anesthesia were studied. Methods: Difficulty of intubation was evaluated with the following four criteria: active mouth opening in the awake patient, Mallampati's classifying system, presence of trismus, clinical and radiological control of localisation and extension of the cellulitis (mandibular, maxillar or mouth floor). In case of a foreseen difficult intubation, a fibrescope was used in the awake patient. Otherwise the endotracheal tube was inserted after administration of propofol (3 mg.k-1) and alfentanil (10 to 20 micrograms.kg-1). A Cormack's grading was performed during intubation. Results: Mouth opening depended on the localisation of the cellulitis. Trismus occurred more often with mandibular than maxillary localisations. Trismus and a Mallampati's class > 2 were associated with difficulty in intubation (Cormack's grade > 2), except in maxillary localisations. Conclusions: The localisation of cellulitis of odontogenic origin is responsible for the difficulty grade of intubation. Awake fibreoptic intubation should be systematically performed in patients with a floor of the mouth cellulitis to reduce the risk of rupture of the abscess by a laryngoscope blade. As trismus associated with mandibular localisations is not relieved by general anaesthesia, awake fibreoptic endotracheal intubation should be preferred.",0,0
18797116,Decreased subepithelial microvasculature observed by high magnification bronchovideoscope in the large airways of smokers,"Objective: A fine vascular network is developed in the subepithelial layer of bronchial mucosa. Cigarette smoking is thought to influence angiogenesis. However, the bronchial microvasculature in smokers has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of the subepithelial microvessels in the large airways of smokers. Methods: Between August 2000 and July 2004, 12 current smokers and 12 nonsmokers were enrolled in this study. The nonsmokers had no abnormal findings in the large airways in the examination of conventional bronchoscopy. Smoking histories varied from 20 to 50 years. The average smoking index was 31.3+/-19.9 (mean+/-SD) pack-years. High magnification bronchovideoscopy was used in this study, which provides information on bronchial mucosa with a maximum magnification of 110 times. To evaluate the characteristics of subepithelial microvessels, 4 parameters were compared between the two groups: 1) vessel area ratio, 2) vessel length ratio, 3) vessel area to length ratio, and 4) hemoglobin index. Results: Subepithelial microvessels of large airways were narrow and sparsely distributed in smokers. Vessel area ratio, vessel length ratio, vessel area to length ratio and hemoglobin index were significantly lower in the smokers than in the nonsmokers (p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p=0.0002, respectively). Conclusion: Subepithelial microvessels of smokers were decreased and narrow, which suggested a decrease in microcirculation in the subepithelial layer of the large airway.",0,0

The fourth National Audit Project (NAP4), endorsed by the Difficult Airway Society, audited advanced airway management and its complications in general theatres, labour wards, critical care units and emergency departments. The NAP4 data allowed the authors to benchmark their own practice against national standards. Using the recommendations in NAP4 they developed a quality improvement intervention to improve airway assessment and tracheal intubation procedures.

21150471,"Exercise capacity, lung function, and quality of life after interventional bronchoscopy","Introduction: Malignant airway obstruction accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with lung and metastatic cancer. We prospectively assessed the effects of bronchoscopic interventions for the treatment of malignant airway obstruction, with specific attention to exercise capacity and quality of life (QoL). Methods: This is a prospective cohort study. Patients with high-grade, symptomatic central malignant airway obstruction were assessed at baseline and then at days 30, 90, and 180 after bronchoscopic intervention with spirometry, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and QoL and dyspnea questionnaires (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life [C30] and Lung Cancer [LC-13] modules). Results: Thirty-seven patients were included in the final statistical analysis.

8678282,[The Bullard laryngoscope. An aid in unforseen difficult intubation],"The standard procedure when difficulties are anticipated with intubation, e.g. following the clinical classification as per Mallampati, is the fibreoptic bronchoscopic method applied while the patient is awake. In the case of unexpected difficulties encountered during intubation while the patient is anaesthetized, a scenario that cannot be absolutely ruled out, e.g. in an emergency resection when there is no longer a simple method of returning the patient to the waking condition, and when problems are accentuated by seriously hampered mask respiration, aspiration risk, danger of hypoxia, and visual obstruction by secretions and blood, the fibrebronchoscope is no longer the instrument of choice. A larynx mask or a combination tube is probably a better option. Our experience has shown that the Bullard laryngoscope (BL) can help to improve the situation because, while it has similar advantages to the flexible bronchoscope, it can be operated almost exactly as quickly as a Macintosh intubation spatula. In contrast to the bronchoscope, fibreoptic orientation under impeded visual conditions caused by secretions and blood is, in our experience, much easier. The BL is routinely deployed, as an alternative to the Macintosh instrument, for practice purposes by all our colleagues in the department. It has proved to be remarkably effective: to date it has led to the target quickly and without complications in every case. As examples three case histories selected from a series of cases in which the BL was used have been highlighted.",0,0
17944641,Prospective randomized comparison of the new Laryngeal Tube Suction LTS II and the LMA-ProSeal for elective surgical interventions,"Background and aim: The Laryngeal Tube Suction (LTS) has recently undergone considerable changes in design. The new LTS II was compared with the LMA-ProSeal to determine device performance during general anaesthesia and controlled ventilation. Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, 100 elective surgical patients were randomized to be ventilated with LTS II or LMA-ProSeal. The number of attempts (maximum of two, and then other device tested) and time until first tidal volume were recorded. Ventilation was standardized (tidal volume, 7 ml/kg; respiratory rate, 12 breaths/min) and the resulting end-tidal CO(2) was recorded. The airway leak pressure (maximum of 40 cmH(2)O) was measured at cuff pressures of 60 cmH(2)O. The ease of gastric tube insertion was evaluated. The devices were inspected for traces of blood after removal. Patients were questioned regarding post-operative complaints. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the groups. Results: The demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiologists' group, Mallampati score, and haemodynamic and respiratory variables were comparable for both groups of 50 patients. Insertion was successful in the first/second attempts in 44/4 patients for LTS II and in 43/6 patients for LMA-ProSeal. After two failed attempts, the other device was successfully used in one patient for LMA-ProSeal and in two patients for LTS II. The times until first tidal volume for LTS II and LMA-ProSeal were 25.0 +/- 10.1 and 25.5 +/- 11.5 s, respectively. The airway leak pressures were comparable: 33.1 (15-40) and 32.0 cmH(2)O (18-40 cmH(2)O) for LTS II and LMA-ProSeal, respectively. Gastric tube insertion failed in two patients in each group. Traces of blood were found in two patients with LTS II and in three patients with LMA-ProSeal. In both groups, post-operative complaints were mild and infrequent. Conclusion: In this prospective randomized trial, LMA-ProSeal and LTS II were comparable in all respects.",0,0

16989449,[Assessment of the effectiveness of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) in the treatment of mild and moderate OSA patients preliminarily selected for the procedure by simple clinical examination],"Introduction: There is abundant conflicting information in the literature about prognostic value of sophisticated, diagnostic tests as well as data from simple clinical examination in its surgical treatment due to the complex nature of OSA. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in the treatment of mild and moderate OSA patients who were preliminary selected by simple clinical examination. Material and method: 20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were included in this study. There were patients who met the following criteria: RDI less than 30, BMI less than 30, collar size less than 43 cm, normal nasal potency, modified Mallampati grade I or II, were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the patients was 45,5. Modified Mallampati score was used for evaluation the structures of oropharynx. Results: 55% of patients were classified for grade I in Mallampati score and 45% of patients- grade II in this scale. At least 50% reduction of RDI after UPPP was observed in 75% of patients. The mean RDI was decreased from 21,35 in preoperative period to 9,85 in the control study. In 60% of our patients the RDI dropped to the value of less then 10. In 5% of the patients, the surgical treatment did not decrease at least 50% of RDI. However in this patient group, we observed a slight improvement of mean minimal saturation (from 84,1 +/- 3,8 to 86,2% +/- 3,6). Conclusion: Using simple clinical parameters for preliminary selection of patients with mild and moderate OSA enabled us to achieve considerably better success rate after UPPP.",0,0

Results: Out of 15,657 intubations, 301 of them were difficult. Eschmann's gum elastic bougie was used 276 times with a rate of success of 99%. Conclusion: Our study confirms the figures of publications, particularly the anglo-saxon ones and proves the interest of the Eschmann's gum elastic bougie in orotracheal intubations and this in first intention.",0,0
16960265,Case report: management of life-threatening oropharyngeal bleeding with recombinant factor VIIa,"Purpose: To report the use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) for management of profuse oropharyngeal bleeding in a cirrhotic patient that nearly resulted in a 'cannot intubate, cannot ventilate' scenario. Clinical features: A 42-yr-old woman with end-stage liver disease presented for orthotopic liver transplantation. She was dialysis dependent and had marked coagulopathy [international normalized ratio (INR) = 3.1], without evidence of active bleeding. Following uneventful induction of anesthesia, routine airway manipulation for tracheal intubation caused profuse upper airway bleeding making visualization of her airway by direct laryngoscopy impossible. Moreover, several further attempts at tracheal intubation along with the bleeding made manual ventilation progressively more difficult, nearly resulting in a 'cannot intubate, cannot ventilate' scenario. In an attempt to control the bleeding, rFVIIa 4.8 mg iv was administered. Within five minutes, her INR had decreased to 1.1, bleeding was markedly reduced, the vocal cords were successfully visualized using an anterior commissure laryngoscope, and intubation of the trachea was achieved with the use of a gum-elastic bougie. Postintubation examination of the airway showed several abrasions along the right oropharyngeal wall with minimal bleeding. The remainder of surgery and postoperative airway management were uneventful. Conclusions: This report demonstrates that in the relatively uncommon setting of upper airway hemorrhage in a patient with pre-existing coagulopathy, rFVIIa can be effective in gaining rapid control of bleeding to facilitate visualization of the vocal cords and securing of the airway.",0,0
9530446,[The difficult intubation. The value of BURP and 3 predictive tests of difficult intubation],"The value of BURP (= backwards-upwards-rightwards-pressure of the larynx) was tested as a improvement of the visualisation of the larynx. Simultaneously we wanted to assess the value of different predictive tests of a difficult intubation, which are easy to perform as bedside tests. Patients and material: 1993 patients of all different surgical clinics in a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland were tested, the complete anaesthesiological staff was involved. We registered the original Mallampati classes, the thyromental distances of Patil and Frerk and the difference of the jugulomental distances in maximally reclined and neutral head position according to Chow. Every anaesthetist also noted his personal, subjective opinion of a possible difficult intubation. Under optimal conditions for intubation we assessed the grade of laryngoscopy according to Wilson and applied BURP if the grade was 3 or higher. Both laryngoscopic grades and the difficulty of intubation were noted. Results: In our study we found 12.5% awkward (Wilson G3-G5) and 4.7% difficult (Wilson G4-G5) laryngoscopies. These could be changed with BURP into 5.0% and 1.9% respectively. With BURP we found 1.8% of difficult intubations. During our study we did not find any patients, whom we could not intubate either with a mandrin inside the tube or with help of the fiberoptic. The relation between sensitivity and specificity was in all single predictors and in two combinations very low. Our personal subjective predictions proofed to be better, but the rate of false negatives was too high for clinical use. Conclusion: BURP is a valuable method for rendering the majority of difficult laryngoscopies into easy ones. It is very easy to learn and does not need any additional equipment. Three commonly used and recommended predictive tests of the difficult intubation proofed to be of little use in clinical practice.",0,0
25821464,Survey of Accepted Practice following Failed Intubation for Emergency Caesarean Delivery,"Background. There is no consensus on the optimum management of failed tracheal intubation in emergency cesarean delivery performed for fetal compromise. The decision making process on whether to wake the patient or continue anesthesia with a supraglottic airway device is an underexplored area. This survey explores perceptions and experiences of obstetric anesthetists managing failed intubation. Methods. Anesthetists attending the Group of Obstetric Anaesthetists London (GOAL) Meeting in April 2014 were surveyed. Results. Ninety-three percent of anesthetists surveyed would not always wake the patient in the event of failed intubation for emergency cesarean delivery performed for fetal compromise. The median (interquartile range) of perceived acceptability of continuing anesthesia with a well-fitting supraglottic airway device, assessed using a visual analogue scale (0-100; 0 completely unacceptable; 100 completely acceptable), was 90 [22.5]. Preoperative patient consent regarding the use of a supraglottic airway device for surgery in the event of failed intubation would affect the decision making of 40% of anaesthetists surveyed. Conclusion. These results demonstrate that a significant body of anesthetists with a subspecialty interest in obstetric anesthesia in the UK would not always wake up the patient and would continue with anesthesia and surgery with a supraglottic airway device in this setting.",0,0
8807177,Retrograde fibreoptic intubation in a child with Nager's syndrome,"Purpose: The authors describe a retrograde fibreoptic technique for tracheal intubation in a micrognathic child with a tracheo-cutaneous fistula. Clinical features: A four-year-old child with Nager's syndrome presented for surgical closure of a tracheocutaneous fistula. A tracheostomy tube had been placed in the neonatal period for management of upper airway obstruction due to severe micrognathia. At 2 1/2 yr of age, after a successful mandibular advancement procedure, the tracheostomy was removed and the child allowed to breathe through the natural airway. Preoperative physical examination revealed an uncooperative child, unable to open her mouth due to limited temporo-mandibular motion. The child was first anaesthetized with ketamine, 70 mg im, then halothane by mask. The authors were unable to open the child's mouth sufficiently to allow rigid laryngoscopy. Attempts at oral and nasal fibreoptic intubation were unsuccessful. Ultimately, the authors were able to intubate nasally by passing an ultrathin Olympus LF-P laryngoscope under direct vision through the tracheocutaneous fistula in a cephalad direction, through the larynx and nasopharynx, then out the nares. An endotracheal tube was then advanced over the fibreoptic scope and positioned distal to the tracheocutaneous fistula. The surgical procedure was successfully accomplished and the trachea was extubated postoperatively without difficulty. Conclusion: Retrograde fibreoptic intubation may be an option for airway management of a select group of children who cannot be intubated by traditional techniques.",0,0
24565244,Difficult airway intubation with flexible bronchoscope,"Background and objective: To describe the efficacy and safety of a flexible bronchoscopy intubation (FBI) protocol in patients with difficult airway. Method: We reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with difficult airway who underwent flexible bronchoscopy intubation under spontaneous ventilation and sedation with midazolam and fentanyl from March 2009 to December 2010. Results: The study enrolled 102 patients, 69 (67.7%) men and 33 (32.3%) women, with a mean age of 44 years. FBI was performed in 59 patients (57.8%) with expected difficult airway in the operating room, in 39 patients (38.2%) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and in 4 patients (3.9%) in the emergency room. Cough, decrease in transient oxygen saturation, and difficult progression of the cannula through the larynx were the main complications, but these factors did not prevent intubation. Conclusion: FBI according to the conscious sedation protocol with midazolam and fentanyl is effective and safe in the management of patients with difficult airway.",0,0
22174458,Preparation of the patient and the airway for awake intubation,"Awake intubation is usually performed electively in the presence of a difficult airway. A detailed airway examination is time-consuming and often not feasible in an emergency. A simple 1-2-3 rule for airway examination allows one to identify potential airway difficulty within a minute. A more detailed airway examination can give a better idea about the exact nature of difficulty and the course of action to be taken to overcome it. When faced with an anticipated difficult airway, the anaesthesiologist needs to consider securing the airway in an awake state without the use of anaesthetic agents or muscle relaxants. As this can be highly discomforting to the patient, time and effort must be spent to prepare such patients both psychologically and pharmacologically for awake intubation. Psychological preparation is best initiated by an anaesthesiologist who explains the procedure in simple language. Sedative medications can be titrated to achieve patient comfort without compromising airway patency. Additional pharmacological preparation includes anaesthetising the airway through topical application of local anaesthetics and appropriate nerve blocks. When faced with a difficult airway, one should call for the difficult airway cart as well as for help from colleagues who have interest and expertise in airway management. Preoxygenation and monitoring during awake intubation is important. Anxious patients with a difficult airway may need to be intubated under general anaesthesia without muscle relaxants. Proper psychological and pharmacological preparation of the patient by an empathetic anaesthesiologist can go a long way in making awake intubation acceptable for all concerned.",0,0
19604192,Thyromental distance measurement--fingers don't rule,"Thyromental distance (TMD) measurement is commonly used to predict difficult intubation. We surveyed anaesthetists to determine how this test was being performed. Comparative accuracy of ruler measurement and other forms of measurement were also assessed in a meta-analysis of published literature. Of respondents, 72% used fingers for TMD measurement and also considered three finger widths the minimum acceptable TMD. In terms of distance, the minimum acceptable TMD was felt to be 6.5 cm by 55% of respondents. However, the actual width of three fingers was (range) 4.6-7.0 cm (mean 5.9 cm), with significant differences between genders and between proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. The meta-analysis showed ruler measurement increased test sensitivity (48% (95% CI 43-53) vs 16% (95% CI 14-19) without a ruler), when predicting difficult intubation.",0,0
20394257,Granular cell myoblastoma of tongue: a rare cause of unanticipated difficult intubation,"Introduction: Intubation with direct laryngoscopy may be impossible in 0.05%-0.35% patients due to an undetected supraglottic mass despite an apparently normal pre-operative airway assessment. We report a case of granular cell myoblastoma of the tongue, as a cause of an unanticipated impossible intubation. Case report: A 55-year-old ASA III male weighing 75 Kg was taken up for emergency exploratory laparotomy with perforation peritonitis. On preoperative airway examination there was no indication of difficult intubation. After induction of anesthesia (rapid sequence with rocuronium) we performed direct laryngoscopy. There was a mass arising from the base of the tongue because of which no recognizable epiglottis or glottic structure could be identified. Despite repeat laryngoscopy, optimal external manipulation and direct laryngoscopy performed by an ENT surgeon, the airway could not be secured. As no fibreoptic laryngoscope was available, a surgical tracheostomy had to be performed.",0,0
18950325,The Callender modification of the Macintosh laryngoscope blade reduces the risk of tooth-blade contact in children,"Background: Dental injury is well recognized as a potential complication of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. The flange of the Macintosh blade may contact teeth during laryngoscopy causing damage. The Callander modification of the Macintosh blade (Callander blade) with a shortened heel at the proximal end has been shown to increase the blade-tooth distance and reduce contact rates in adults. Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Callander blade on reducing dental contact in children. Methods: One hundred children, aged 4-14 years, scheduled for general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were studied prospectively. The children were preoperatively evaluated for Mallampati score and dental defects, looseness, and avulsions. Following induction of anesthesia, laryngoscopy was performed twice on each child in succession, once with a standard Macintosh blade and once with a Callander blade of the same size in a random order. The blade-tooth distance and contact rate were compared between the two blades. Results: With the Callander blade, the blade-tooth distance was greater than with the Macintosh (1.78 +/- 1.77 vs 0.28 +/- 0.76 mm, P = 0.001). The frequency of direct contact was less with the Callander blade than it was with the Macintosh blade (33% vs 86%, respectively, P = 0.008). However, difficult laryngoscopy rate did not differ between the blades. Tracheal intubation was successful in all children and there was no dental injury. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the Callander blade decreases the risk for dental injury and provides tracheal intubating conditions in children with normal airways similar to those obtained with a traditional Macintosh blade.",0,0
20434108,A comparison between the Airtraq and Macintosh laryngoscopes for routine airway management by experienced anesthesiologists: a randomized clinical trial,"Background: The Airtraq Optical Laryngoscope is a new type of laryngoscope that provides a direct view of the glottis without alignment of the mouth, pharynx and trachea. Data show that it has advantages over the Macintosh laryngoscope. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the use of the Airtraq laryngo-scope versus the No. 3 Macintosh blade for routine airway management in terms of intubation time, complications during and after laryngoscopy, and ease of use. Methods: In this single-center, randomized, clinical trial, 63 patients scheduled for elective operation were randomly allocated to two groups. Thirty-five patients were intubated with the Airtraq laryngoscope and 28 with the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope. All intubations were performed by experienced anesthesiologists who had a similar level of experience with the Airtraq laryngoscope. The time needed for intubation, any assistance required, complications during and after laryngoscopy and intubation, and the number of unsuccessful intubation attempts were documented and compared between the groups. Results: Intubation with the Macintosh laryngoscope was quicker (mean+/-standard deviation: 23.7+/-5.9 seconds) than with the Airtraq laryngoscope (29.6+/-8.5 seconds). Although the difference (5.9 seconds) was statistically significant (p<0.05), it was not clinically significant. The anesthesiologists who used the Airtraq laryngo-scope less frequently required assistance (p<0.05) to place the endotracheal tube. No differences were found regarding complications during and after laryngoscopy and intubation. There were no differences in any of the outcomes in patients with Mallampati class > 2. Conclusion: The Airtraq laryngoscope is easier to use but it does not have any significant advantages compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope for routine airway management. More studies are needed to evaluate its use in patients with a difficult airway, and in emergency procedures.",0,0
19947865,How much force is required to dislodge an alternate airway?,"Introduction: Endotracheal tube (ETT) dislodgment is a potentially catastrophic adverse event. Newer alternate airway devices-esophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC), King laryngeal tube disposable airway (King LT), and laryngeal mask airway (LMA)-are easier to insert, but their relative extubating forces remain unknown. Objective: To examine the applied forces required to dislodge an ETC, King LT, LMA, and ETT. Methods: We used five recently deceased adult unembalmed cadavers. In random order, we sequentially inserted an ETC, King LT, LMA, and standard ETT. Because commercial tube holders are not designed for all alternate airways, we secured the devices with a standard adhesive tape method. Using a precision digital force measuring device, we measured the minimum manually applied axial force (lb) that dislodged each airway device at least 4 cm. We compared required dislodgment forces between airway devices using a mixed-effects regression model, adjusting for cadaver height, weight, neck circumference, and thyromental distance. Results: Characteristics of the cadavers were as follows (median, interquartile range [IQR]): height 172 cm (167-177), weight 98 kg (84-120), neck circumference 46.5 cm (41-52), and thyromental distance 7.5 cm (7.5-8). Required axial dislodgment forces for each airway device were as follows (median, IQR): ETC 28.3 lb (19.0-28.6), King LT 12.5 lb (11.7-13.3), LMA 18.3 lb (14.0-21.9), and ETT 14.4 lb (13.5-22.1). The ETC required twice as much dislodgment force as the ETT (adjusted difference 16.7 lb, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.3 to 25.1). The King LT and LMA dislodgment forces were similar to that of the ETT (King LT vs. ETT adjusted difference 5.9 lb, 95% CI: -2.4 to 14.2; LMA vs. ETT 8.1 lb, 95% CI: -0.2 to 16.5). Conclusion: In a cadaver model of unintended airway dislodgment, the ETC required the most force for dislodgment. The King LT and LMA performed similarly to a standard ETT.",0,0
3631477,A laryngoscope adaptor for difficult intubation,"Tracheal intubation may be hindered by difficulty in insertion of the laryngoscope blade into the patient's mouth because the handle impinges on the patient's chest or on the hand of an assistant applying cricoid pressure. An adaptor is described which modifies the standard Penlon laryngoscope to enable lateral swivelling of the handle, thus avoiding the obstruction.",0,0
22459727,Detection of risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation,"Several studies have identified difficult airway management including a difficult tracheal intubation of patients undergoing general anaesthesia as a major cause of anaesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore it is presumed that a difficult tracheal intubation is a surrogate marker for morbidity and mortality, and by reducing the prevalence of difficult tracheal intubation then morbidity and mortality will be reduced as well. From the Danish Anaesthesia Database (DAD), we retrieved a cohort of consecutive patients planned and attempted for tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy. Based upon various data including an intubation score registered in the database, we aimed to evaluate four different parameters, 'Obesity', 'avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents', 'a previous difficult tracheal intubation' and 'the modified Mallampati-score', as possible risk factors for a difficult tracheal intubation. All of these risk factors were statistically associated with a difficult tracheal intubation, but the clinical significance varied substantially. However, neither 'obesity', 'the modified Mallampati-score' nor 'a previous difficult tracheal intubation' were sufficient as stand-alone tests for prediction of difficult tracheal intubation. In multivariate analyses the impact of obesity on the risk of difficult tracheal intubation seems weak, while both 'the modified Mallampati-score' and 'a previous difficult tracheal intubation' demonstrated to be clinically strong risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation. The evaluation of 'avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents' as a risk factor differ substantially from the other assessments, as it concerns the impact of an intervention rather than of a patient-related risk factor for difficult tracheal intubation. In our assessment, 'avoiding neuromuscular blocking agents' was demonstrated as a possible risk factor for difficult and abandoned tracheal intubation independent of other risk factors recorded in the DAD. Several previous studies have failed to present specific risk factors that could identify difficult intubation or laryngoscopy by itself. Therefore it seems rational to focus on the development, testing and modification of multivariate models from large scale cohort studies, hereby making the prognostication operational in everyday clinical practice. From there the challenge may be to test the effectiveness of the use of such a model in order to evaluate whether it actually has the capability to reduce difficult tracheal intubation, complications, and mortality. It seems that such a trial should and could be conducted as a cluster randomized trial of anaesthesia departments within the framework of the DAD.",0,0
15692534,A simple and reliable predictor for an adequate laryngeal view with rigid endoscopic laryngoscopy,"Objectives: It is sometimes impossible to obtain an adequate laryngeal view during rigid endoscopic laryngoscopy. This may be due to a high tongue base. Our study seeks to determine a correlation between tongue base level and the adequacy of laryngeal view obtained with a 70-degree rigid endoscope. Study design and setting: Over a period of 4 months, patients from a voice clinic were gathered and categorized into class I to III according to Mallampati et al (1985). Rigid laryngo-videostroboscopy was conducted to assess the larynx and the adequacy of the view was recorded. Results: 74 patients were recruited. The number of adequate views were: class I = 18/20 (90%); class II = 20/33 (60.6%); class III = 7/21 (33.3%). chi 2 analysis demonstrated significance trend in all 3 classes. Conclusion: The level of the tongue base correlated well with the adequacy of laryngeal view obtained from a 70-degree rigid endoscope. This can be used to predict the success of obtaining adequate views during rigid laryngoscopy.",0,0
25948356,Chronological assessment of airway lesions in relapsing polychondritis by positron emission tomography,"A 40-year old woman presented with pyrexia, productive cough, and bilateral precordial pain. Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) showed high, diffuse F-18 deoxyglucose accumulation in the tracheal, peribronchial, and bilateral costal cartilage. We diagnosed her with relapsing polychondritis (RP) based on McAdam's criteria. Airway lesions are a major prognostic indicator of RP, and so chronological assessment and control is essential. In this patient, PET-CT accurately reflected both the location and severity of the inflammation and helped to guide treatment decision-making and facilitated early detection of recurrence. However, its high cost is prohibitive to frequent use, making it necessary to comprehensively evaluate serum C-reactive protein levels, bronchoscopy, spirometry, and 3D-CT.",0,0
21617621,"Propofol, remifentanil and mivacurium: fast track surgery with poor intubating conditions","Background: Mivacurium is widespread used because it is the non-depolarizing muscle relaxant with the shortest duration time. Therefore, it seems to be ideal for fast track or ambulatory surgery. However, especially in combination with propofol and remifentanil onset time remains unclear and incidence of poor intubating conditions seems to be higher than in other regimes of anesthesia. Methods: We included 35 ear, nose and throat (ENT) patients in this study. Muscle relaxation was measured by acceleromyograhpy at the adductor pollicis muscle (a.p.m.) and intubating conditions were evaluated. Anesthesia was induced with 2.5 mg kg-1 propofol and 1 µg kg-1 remifentanil and intubation was performed three minutes after the administration of 0.2 mg kg-1 mivacurium. Open vocal cords conjoined with full relaxation of the a.p.m., easy mouth opening and prevention of coughing and bucking represented the primary endpoint in this study. Results: Only 20% of patients (N.=7) had optimal intubating conditions and achieved the primary endpoint. In 21 patients (60%) a complete block of the a.p.m. could not be achieved and in six patients (17%) the vocal cords were closed. In seven patients (20%) we observed difficult mouth opening and in 11 patients (31%) coughing and bucking. In addition, we found a prolonged onset time of 228±95 seconds (mean±SD). Conclusion: In combination with propofol and remifentanil the muscle relaxant agent mivacurium led to uncertain muscle relaxation and to poor intubating conditions. Therefore the study was aborted after 35 patients. Probably mivacurium is not a useful muscle relaxant agent if fast and deep muscle relaxation is needed. The advantage of a short duration time is foiled by intubation complications due to insufficient muscle relaxation.",0,0
10211034,Large goitre causing difficult intubation and failure to intubate using the intubating laryngeal mask airway: lessons for next time,"A 63-yr-old woman was anaesthetized for sub-total thyroidectomy. The thyroid gland was large, deviating the trachea to the right and causing 30% tracheal narrowing at the level of the suprasternal notch. Mask ventilation was easy but laryngoscopy was Cormack and Lehane grade 3. Despite being able to see the tip of the epiglottis, tracheal intubation was impossible. An intubating laryngeal mask was inserted and although the airway was clear and ventilation easy, it was not possible to intubate the trachea either blindly or with the fibreoptic bronchoscope. Tracheal intubation was eventually achieved using a 6.5-mm cuffed oral tracheal tube via a size 4 laryngeal mask under fibreoptic control. We describe the case in detail and discuss the use of the intubating laryngeal mask, its potential limitations and how to optimize its use in similar circumstances.",0,0
25626630,Risk Factors and Outcomes of Reversal Agent Use in Moderate Sedation During Endoscopy and Colonoscopy,"Background: Moderate sedation has been standard for noninvasive gastrointestinal procedures for decades yet there are limited data on reversal agent use and outcomes associated with need for reversal of sedation. Aim: To determine prevalence and clinical significance of reversal agent use during endoscopies and colonoscopies. Methods: Individuals with adverse events requiring naloxone and/or flumazenil during endoscopy or colonoscopy from 2008 to 2013 were identified. A control group was obtained by random selection of patients matched by procedure type and date. Prevalence of reversal agent use and statistical comparison of patient demographics and risk factors against controls were determined. Results: Prevalence of reversal agent use was 0.03% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02-0.04]. Events triggering reversal use were oxygen desaturation (64.4%), respiration changes (24.4%), hypotension (8.9%), and bradycardia (6.7%). Two patients required escalation of care and the majority of patients were stabilized and discharged home. Compared with the control group, the reversal group was older (61±1.8 vs. 55±1.6, P=0.01), mostly female (82% vs. 50%, P<0.01), and had lower body mass index (24±0.8 vs. 27±0.7, P=0.03) but received similar dosages of sedation. When adjusted for age, race, sex, and body mass index, the odds of reversal agent patients having a higher ASA score than controls was 4.7 (95% CI, 1.7-13.1), and the odds of having a higher Mallampati score than controls was 5.0 (95% CI, 2.1-11.7) with P<0.01. Conclusions: Prevalence of reversal agent use during moderate sedation is low and outcomes are generally good. Several clinically relevant risk factors for reversal agent use were found suggesting that certain groups may benefit from closer monitoring.",0,0
26061576,Inadvertent Endobronchial Intubation in a Patient With a Short Neck Length,"Inadvertent placement of the endotracheal tube into the right bronchus during intubation for general anesthesia is a fairly common occurrence. Many precautions should be taken by the anesthesia provider in order to minimize the incidence of endobronchial intubation, including bilateral auscultation of the lungs, use of the 21/23 rule, and palpation of the inflated endotracheal cuff at the sternal notch. These provisions, however, are not foolproof; anesthesia providers should realize that endobronchial intubation may occur from time to time because of variations in patient anatomy, changes in patient positioning, and cephalad pressures exerted during surgery. A 58-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease received general endotracheal anesthesia for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His height was 165 cm (5 ft, 5 in) and the endotracheal tube was secured at his incisors at 21 cm after placement with a rigid laryngoscope. Bilateral breath sounds were confirmed with auscultation, although they were distant because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After radiographic examination in the postanesthesia care unit, a right main-stem intubation was revealed to have taken place, resulting in complete atelectasis of the left lung. After repositioning of the endotracheal tube, radiography confirmed that the patient had an anatomically short tracheal length.",0,0
22459781,Volumetric optical frequency domain imaging of pulmonary pathology with precise correlation to histopathology,"Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Radiology and bronchoscopy techniques do not have the necessary resolution to evaluate lung lesions on the microscopic scale, which is critical for diagnosis. Bronchial biopsy specimens can be limited by sampling error and small size. Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) provides volumetric views of tissue microstructure at near-histologic resolution and may be useful for evaluating pulmonary lesions to increase diagnostic accuracy. Bronchoscopic OFDI has been evaluated in vivo, but a lack of correlated histopathology has limited the ability to develop accurate image interpretation criteria. Methods: We performed OFDI through two approaches (airway-centered and parenchymal imaging) in 22 ex vivo lung specimens, using tissue dye to precisely correlate imaging and histology. Results: OFDI of normal airway allowed visualization of epithelium, lamina propria, cartilage, and alveolar attachments. Carcinomas exhibited architectural disarray, loss of normal airway and alveolar structure, and rapid light attenuation. Squamous cell carcinomas showed nested architecture. Atypical glandular formation was appreciated in adenocarcinomas, and uniform trabecular gland formation was seen in salivary gland carcinomas. Mucinous adenocarcinomas showed alveolar wall thickening with intraalveolar mucin. Interstitial fibrosis was visualized as signal-dense tissue, with an interstitial distribution in mild interstitial fibrotic disease and a diffuse subpleural pattern with cystic space formation in usual interstitial pneumonitis. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstration of volumetric OFDI with precise correlation to histopathology in lung pathology. We anticipate that OFDI may play a role in assessing airway and parenchymal pathology, providing fresh insights into the volumetric features of pulmonary disease.",0,0
21159025,The difficult pediatric airway--a review of new devices for indirect laryngoscopy in children younger than two years of age,"During the last decade, several new look-around-corner or video airway devices have proven useful in clinical adult practice. Only four of them are currently available in sizes that may be used in children younger than 2 years of age: the AIRTRAQ® Disposable Optical Laryngoscope (Prodol Meditec, Vizcaya, Spain), the GlideScope® Video Laryngoscope (Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA), the Storz DCI® Video Laryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), and the Truview PCD™ Infant (Truphatek, Netanya, Israel). Here, we review the literature and describe the clinical use of each device in this age-group. The four new laryngoscopes are generally effective and may solve many of the problems with difficult intubations in children younger than 2 years of age. The size of the device and the mouth opening it requires determines its usefulness in the smallest infants. Training will be necessary in implementing and deciding when to use the new airway devices, although one of the big challenges of the future will be to maintain the teaching and training of fiber-optic-guided intubations, which remain the gold standard in difficult endotracheal intubations.",0,0
23764717,A comparison of the GlideScope with the Macintosh laryngoscope for nasotracheal intubation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis,"Purpose: The GlideScope (GS) video laryngoscope has been proven to be a suitable intubating device for a predicted difficult intubation. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) presented with particularly challenging airway management problems to the anesthesiologists. The benefits of using a GS in these patients have not been fully explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the GS, in comparison with the Macintosh laryngoscope, when performing nasotracheal intubation in patients with AS under general anesthesia. Methods: A total of 60 ASA I-II patients with AS were randomly assigned to undergo nasotracheal intubation using either the GS or the Macintosh laryngoscope. Preoperative airway assessments were performed in an attempt to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. Duration and number of intubation attempts, success rates, number of optimization maneuvers, Cormack and Lehane grades, Percentage of Glottic Opening (POGO) scores for each attempt, and difficulty of device use (VAS difficulty scores) were recorded. Complications associated with intubation were also recorded. Results: The rate of successful nasotracheal intubation was lower with the Macintosh laryngoscope (70%) compared with the GS (96.7%). In comparison with the Macintosh laryngoscope, the GS significantly reduced the intubation difficulty score, duration of tracheal intubation attempts, need for optimization maneuvers, and improved the Cormack and Lehane grade obtained during laryngoscopy. Conclusions: The GS reduced the difficulty of tracheal intubation and provided a better laryngoscopic view with higher overall success rates and shorter duration of intubation attempts than the Macintosh laryngoscope. In our study, the GS proved to be a better alternative in most cases, compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, for intubating AS patients who preferred their airway management under general anesthesia.",0,0
2265042,Measurement of end-expiratory pressure during transtracheal high frequency jet ventilation for laryngoscopy,"An anaesthetic technique using high frequency jet ventilation has been proposed for direct laryngoscopy, but this may expose the patients to the risk of barotrauma. In order to assess this risk, we have measured end-expiratory airway pressure (EEP) through the injector using two three-way solenoid valves mounted in series. At the end of insufflation the first valve was switched off and the apparatus deadspace connected to atmosphere through a large exit port during an adjustable time (decompression time). Then the second valve was switched off and the injection line connected to a transducer, allowing measurement of EEP through the injector. The accuracy of this measurement was tested against airway pressure measured directly in the trachea (Pt) in a lung model. Provided that the decompression time was long enough (70 ms) and the apparatus deadspace was small (6 ml), the difference between EEP and Pt was less than 1 cm H2O for frequencies up to 5 Hz. A clinical evaluation was performed in 64 patients under general anaesthesia before laryngoscopy. EEP correlated with end-expiratory pulmonary volume above apnoeic FRC inferred from abdominal and thoracic displacements. At jet frequencies up to 5 Hz, the correlations between these two variables were satisfactory (r greater than 0.88), suggesting that EEP is a good indicator of pulmonary overdistension.",0,0
15852622,[Mouth opening in relation to the craniocervical position during induction of general anesthesia],"Background: Decreased mouth opening and limited neck mobility sometimes make direct laryngoscopy or tracheal intubation difficult and compromise the safety in establishing the airway during induction of general anesthesia. Recent report indicated that mouth opening was related to the craniocervical position in awake subjects. The query about whether the neck position modulate the mouth opening during anesthetic induction under paralyzed condition is not clarified. We hypothesized that the neck extension and the flexion induce changes in inter-incisor distance (IID) during anesthetic induction. Methods: Thirty relatively young patients for general anesthesia were (male; 20, female; 10) subjected. IID was measured with his/her neck positioned flexed, neutral and extended in the sagittal plane, each at preanesthetic awake period, and during anesthetic induction period. The effect of sniffing position on the mouth opening was also studied. Results: At preanesthetic period, IID (mean +/- SD in mm) at neck flexion (37.4 +/- 7.8) was significantly shorter than both at neutral (44.1 +/- 7.5) and at extension (47.4 +/- 7.0). During induction, significant increase in IID was observed as patients' neck position changed from flexed (31.8 +/- 5.4) to neutral (36.6 +/- 5.4), and extended, (41.7 +/- 8.3). Sniffing position did not affect the mouth opening both at preanesthetic and during anesthetic induction period. Conclusions: Craniocervical extension may play a desirable role in the airway management with mouth opening widely during anesthetic induction under neuromuscular blockade.",0,0
17647131,The implications of upper-airway obstruction on successful infant feeding,"Oral feeding in infants requires highly integrated sucking, swallowing, and respiratory sequencing controlled by the neurologic system. Rapid neuromuscular coordination of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of swallowing must be coordinated with respiration in the swallowing process. When obstruction is present in the upper airway secondary to anatomic or physiologic anomalies, disruption to the oral feeding process may occur. The infant will likely be unable to coordinate sucking and swallowing with breathing in an advantageous sequence. Inefficient feeding and difficulty with airway protection during swallowing may have serious implications regarding the infant's respiratory health as well as ability to gain weight adequately. A stable and patent airway is always the first priority in the management of the infant with upper-airway obstruction. Evaluation of the infant's potential for oral feeding may occur simultaneously with the initial evaluation of the degree of airway obstruction or it may occur following medical or surgical intervention for the airway obstruction. The evaluation process and management options for oral feeding will depend upon the method used to establish a patent airway. Clinical assessment by the speech-language pathologist includes a thorough assessment of oral sensory and motor mechanics, recognition of clinical signs and symptoms of swallowing dysfunction, and consideration of referral for instrumental assessment to obtain objective information regarding airway protection and swallowing function. A variety of medical and feeding interventions may be used to help support oral feeding to whatever extent is safe and efficient. Infants with significant oral feeding problems in the presence of airway obstruction may require a period of supplemental tube feeding and non-nutritive oral stimulation.",0,0
17845660,Use of the Airtraq laryngoscope in a model of difficult intubation by prehospital providers not previously trained in laryngoscopy,"This study evaluated the ability of prehospital providers who had no previous training in intubation, to use an Airtraq laryngoscope to intubate a manikin model of a Cormack and Lehane grade III/IV view. Volunteers attending the Australian College of Ambulance Professionals conference, Adelaide, in November 2006 received approximately 5 min of Airtraq training. First-time intubation success rate was 26/33 (79%) (95% CI 61-91%); oesophageal intubation rate was 0/33 (0%) (95% CI 0-11%); median time to intubation was 17 s (IQR 10-25 s (range 5-30 s)); and median subject-rated difficulty of use score was 21 out of a maximum of 100 (IQR 7.5-35.5 (range 1-65)). Pre-hospital providers without previous laryngoscopy training achieved high first-time intubation success rates when managing a model of a grade III/IV difficult intubation with an Airtraq laryngoscope. Users evaluated it as easy to use and achieved intubation within an acceptable breath-to-breath interval.",0,0
15485999,Fluoroscope-aided retrograde placement of guide wire for tracheal intubation in patients with limited mouth opening,"Passing a retrograde catheter/wire into the pharynx through a cricothyroid puncture can facilitate tracheal intubation in difficult situations where either a flexible fibre-optic bronchoscope or an expert user of such a device is not available. Some mouth opening is essential for the oral and/or nasal retrieval of the catheter/wire from the pharynx. Two patients with temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis and extremely limited mouth opening required gap arthroplasty of the TMJ under general anaesthesia. Because we did not have a flexible fibre-optic bronchoscope, we performed fluoroscopy-assisted nasal retrieval of the guide wire passed up through a cricothyroid puncture and subsequently accomplished wire-guided naso-tracheal intubation. In the absence of a flexible fibre-optic bronchoscope, this technique is a very useful aid to intubation in patients with limited mouth opening.",0,0
8530797,Use of the laryngeal mask prior to definitive intubation in a difficult airway: a case report,"The laryngeal mask, a relatively new airway adjunct, consists of a large tube with an inflatable shallow mask at its distal end which forms a seal around the glottic opening. We describe a case of a difficult intubation in the emergency department of an obese patient with microagnathia, a short bull neck, and a nasopharyngeal hemorrhage in which a laryngeal mask was used to temporarily manage the airway prior to definitive intubation. In difficult airway cases where it is impossible to ventilate the patient by face mask or intubate the trachea, ventilation with the laryngeal mask may be an alternative to transtracheal jet ventilation or cricothyrotomy. The laryngeal mask may be useful in managing the difficult airway provided that the risks of an inadequate seal, obstruction, coughing and laryngospasm, and lack of protection from aspiration are recognized.",0,0
21243927,Anaesthetic challenges associated with achondroplasia: a case report,We report the anaesthetic management of two achondroplastic patients who presented for emergency cesarean section. Regional anaesthesia could not be done in both cases as a result of technical difficulties and general anaesthesia was performed. Airway management was done with two different techniques following airway assessment. The perioperative periods were uneventful. We discuss the anaesthetic implications and problems associated with regional and general anaesthesia in achondroplastic parturients. The controversies in the anesthetic management of these patients are also highlighted.,0,0
25439400,Observational study of Mallampati changes after prone spinal surgery,"Study objective: To evaluate airway changes in patients undergoing surgery in the prone position. Design: Single-arm observational study. Patients: Patients between 18 to 65 years old, scheduled for prone spinal surgery; 74 patients were enrolled and 54 patients were analyzed. Intervention: The initial airway examination was graded according to the Samsoon and Young modification of the Mallampati classification (MMP). Airway photographs were obtained in a standardized manner and were repeated 20 minutes after extubation. The photographs were then randomized. Measurements: Subjects' age, gender, race, weight, duration of surgery, amount of crystalloid fluid given, and estimated blood loss were recorded. Three senior anesthesiologists who were blinded to the origin of the photographs analyzed and graded the airways. Main results: All statistical tests showed significance between pre-MMP and post-MMP scores (P<0.001). There was no difference between pre and post interobserver MMP scores. The MMPs of 12 patients (22%) did not change and MMP scores were changed in 42 patients (78%): 30 (71%) patients by one class, 10 (24%) patients by two classes, and two patients (5%) by three classes. There was no correlation between patients whose MMP was changed and length of surgery or crystalloid administered. Conclusion: Modified Mallampati scores increased in the majority of patients after spinal surgery in the prone position.",0,0
22992963,Comparison of cuff-pressure changes in silicone and PVC laryngeal masks during nitrous oxide anaesthesia in spontaneously breathing children,"Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cuff pressures of four different laryngeal masks in paediatric patients undergoing routine surgery and to determine whether there is a substantial increase in cuff pressure when silicone masks are used compared to PVC laryngeal mask airways. Methods: Hundred and forty patients aged < 16 yr were randomly allocated to receive one of four extra glottic airway devices: LMA-Classic; LMA-Unique; Soft Seal; or Cobra-PLA. Intracuff pressure was monitored continuously throughout the operative intervention. The primary outcome was measurement of an increase in cuff pressure. First attempt success rate, effective airway time, anatomical position of the airway and incidence of airway morbidity data were monitored. Results: Mean cuff pressure increased within 5 min of N2O exposure, and was substantially higher in the silicone LMA-C,compared to the PVC-based extra glottic airway devices tested, reaching a plateau of the cuff pressure after 45 min.The overall first attempt success rate (97%) and the mean effective airway time (24 ± 9 sec) were very satisfactory and all patients underwent successful surgery. Anatomical position was adequate in most airways, although in 34%of the patients in the Cobra group herniation of either the epiglottis or arytenoids were detected. Airway morbidity due to the devices was insignificant. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a substantial increase in cuff pressure during anaesthesia for children in whom a silicone-based LMA-C was used, whereas PVC-based extra glottic airway devices showed a much lower increase.",0,0
12425126,Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and its effect on laryngeal visualization and intubation: a case report,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can have a profound effect upon visualization of the larynx. Changes at the cellular level can produce edema and subglottic stenosis thus causing airway difficulties of dire consequence if not recognized. Preoperative anesthesia evaluation of any patient presenting with a history of GERD should alert the anesthesia provider to the possibility of airway management problems. Subsequent steps should be taken to prepare the patient for potential difficult airway management. Preventative measures are desirable and support a better outcome, but in many instances such measures are deferred and anesthesia proceeds anyway; should this occur, immediate access to fiberoptic visualization and a difficult airway cart is imperative. Due to the increasing incidence of GERD in the general population, it is of utmost importance that it be considered during any airway assessment. This will enhance patient care and eliminate the element of surprise during this critical time.",0,0
8829868,Use of LMA for awake intubation for caesarean section,"Purpose: This case report describes the use of a Laryngeal Mask Airway in a morbidly obese parturient with the H.E.L.L.P. syndrome. An urgent Caesarean section was required because of vaginal bleeding and fetal distress. Clinical features: The patient was a 32 year old G3, T1, P1, L1 who presented with epigastric pain, headache, vomiting, and diarrhoea. She was hypertensive (180/110 mmHg) and thrombocytopaenic (18 x 10(-9). L-1). Examination of the airway revealed a short neck, receded jaw, full dentition, large breasts and she was considered to be a potential intubation problem. The patient required an awake intubation using a technique that minimized hypertension, aspiration risk, airway trauma, and hypoxia. A laryngeal mask was used to facilitate tracheal intubation, and the patient tolerated the procedure with no adverse outcome. Conclusion: The LMA has a place to facilitate potentially difficult awake tracheal intubation with the pregnant patient.",0,0
23493981,Oropharyngeal crowding and obesity as predictors of oral appliance treatment response to moderate obstructive sleep apnea,"Background: Oral appliances are increasingly prescribed for patients with moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) instead of nasal CPAP. However, the efficacy of oral appliances varies greatly. We hypothesized that oral appliances were not efficacious in patients with moderate OSA who were obese with oropharyngeal crowding. Methods: Japanese patients with moderate OSA were prospectively and consecutively recruited. The Mallampati score (MS) was used as an estimate of oropharyngeal crowding. Follow-up polysomnography was performed with the adjusted oral appliance in place. Responders were defined as subjects who showed a follow-up apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of &lt; 5 with &gt; 50% reduction in baseline AHI. Results: The mean baseline AHI was reduced with an oral appliance from 21 ± 4 to 9.8 ± 8 in 95 subjects. Thirty-five patients were regarded as responders. Logistic regression analyses revealed that both MS and BMI could individually predict the treatment outcome. When the cutoff value of BMI was determined to be 24 kg/m2 based on a receiver operating characteristic curve, 53 obese patients (ie, BMI &gt; 24 kg/m2) with an MS of class 4 were indicative of treatment failure with a high negative predictive value (92) and a low negative likelihood ratio (0.28). Conclusions: We conclude that patients with moderate OSA who are obese with oropharyngeal crowding are unlikely to respond to oral appliance treatment. This simple prediction can be applied without the need for any cumbersome tools immediately after the diagnosis of OSA.",0,0
18055296,Lightwand-guided endotracheal intubation performed by the nondominant hand is feasible,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of lightwand-guided endotracheal intubation (LWEI) performed using either the right (dominant) or left (nondominant) hand. Two hundred and forty patients aged 21-64 years, with a Mallampati airway classification grade of I-II and undergoing endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia, were enrolled in this randomized and controlled study. Induction of anesthesia was initiated by intravenous administration of fentanyl (2 microg/kg) and thiopentone (5 mg/kg), and tracheal intubation was facilitated by intravenous atracurium (0.5 mg/kg). In the direct-vision laryngoscope group (group D; n = 80), the intubator held the laryngoscope in the left hand and inserted the endotracheal tube (ETT) into the glottic opening with the right hand. In the group in which LWEI was performed with the right hand (group R; n = 80), the intubator lifted the patients' jaws with the left hand and inserted the ETT-LW unit into the glottic openings with the right hand. On the contrary, in the group in which LWEI was performed with the left hand (group L; n = 80), the intubator lifted the jaws with the right hand and inserted the ETT-LW unit with the left hand. Data including total intubation time, the number of intubation attempts, hemodynamic changes during intubation, and side effects following intubation, were collected. Regardless of whether lightwand manipulation was performed with the left hand (group L; 11.4 +/- 9.3 s) or the right-hand (group R; 12.4 +/- 9.2 s), less time was consumed in the LWEI groups than in the laryngoscope group (group D; 17.9 +/- 9.9 s) (p < 0.001). All three groups obtained success rates greater than 95% on their first intubation attempts. The changes in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were similar among the three groups. A higher incidence of intubation-related oral injury and ventricular premature contractions (VPC) was found in group D compared with groups L and R (oral injury: group D 8.5%, group L 1.3%, group R 0%, p = 0.005; VPC: group D 16.3%, group L 5%, group R 7.5%, p = 0.04). We concluded that LWEI performed by either dominant or nondominant hands resulted in similar efficiency, and could be a suitable alternative to traditional laryngoscopy. It is both feasible and logical for an experienced anesthesiologist to use the nondominant hand to perform LWEI.",0,0
22474556,Fiberoptic intubation through a laryngeal mask airway as a management of difficult airwary due to the fusion of the entire cervical spine - A report of two cases -,"Patients with cervical spine instability and limited range of motion are challenge to anesthesiologists. It is important to consider alternatetive methods for securing the airway while maintaining neutral position and minimizing neck motion, because these patients are at increased risk for tracheal intubation failure and neurologic injury during airway management or position change. We experienced two cases that patients had cervical spine instability and severe limited range of motion due to the fusion of the entire cervical spine. One patient was a 6-year-old girl weighing 12.7 kg and had Klippel-Feil syndrome with Arnold-Chiari malformation, the other was a 24-year-old female weighing 31 kg and had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. We successfully performed the intubation by using the fiberoptic intubation though a laryngeal mask airway in these two cases.",0,0
19133519,Multicentered study of model of difficult endotracheal intubation by incident reports from university and non-university hospitals,"Objective: To compare the characteristics, causative factors, outcomes, prevention, and suggested preventive strategies of difficult intubation between university (U) and general community (non-U) hospitals. Material and method: One thousand nine hundred and ninety-six reports were reviewed from Thai anesthesia incident monitoring study (Thai AIMS) conducted in 51 hospitals nationwide between January and June 2007. Thirty-four cases ofDI were reported from U hospitals and 69 cases from non-U hospitals. The described details on each report on dfficult intubation (DI) in adults undergoing general anesthesia were thoroughly reviewed by three reviewers to give their consensus opinions on causative factors, outcomes, contributing preventive factors, and strategies for corrections. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Results: Patient factors were the most common cause of DI (88% in U and 87% in non-U hospitals). Fifty percent of U and 51% of non-U DI cases were consequences of human errors, which were preventable and mostly based on knowledge (88% vs. 71%) and rules of practice (23% vs. 51%). Substitution of an intubating anesthesiologist, reducing the size of endotracheal tubes, and stylet guided technique were the three commonly used methods after DI. MacCoy laryngoscope, fiber optic-aided intubation, laryngeal mask airway and Frova introducer were commonly used as substitutes for the standard laryngoscope. Inadequate experience was the major problem of U hospitals, which required additional training to gain more skill. The most common problem ofDI in non-U hospitals was inadequate preanesthetic evaluation. Therefore, they required practice guidelines and experienced assistants in difFicult situations. Conclusion: Half of DI cases were preventable. DI cases in Non-U hospitals were mostly caused by inadequate preanesthetic evaluation. This indicates the necessities of providing practice guidelines and experienced assistants. In U hospitals, in-training practice of intubation should be performed under supervision. More advanced substitution techniques were applicable in U hospitals.",0,0
12790816,The rigid nasendoscope as a tool for difficult tracheal intubation: a manikin study,"We examined the use of the 30 degrees rigid nasendoscope in aiding difficult tracheal intubations. A Cormack and Lehane grade 4 difficult intubation (no view of glottis or epiglottis) was set up on a manikin. After 10 s of tuition, 40 anaesthetists attempted to pass a standard gum elastic bougie between the cords, with and without the nasendoscope, in randomised order. A bougie curved to an 'optimal curve' was also tested. Using the standard bougie 13/40 (33%) passed the bougie between the cords without the nasendoscope, compared with 31/40 (78%) when using the nasendoscope (p < 0.001). The 'optimal curve' bougie resulted in 29/40 (73%) and 39/40 (98%) success rates without and with the nasendoscope, respectively (p = 0.004). The nasendoscope is a simple and easy to use tool in grade 4 intubation, and results are improved further by the use of an 'optimal curve' bougie.",0,0
25024473,Sensitivity of palm print sign in prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in diabetes: A comparison with other airway indices,"Background and aims: Diabetic patients are prone for the limited joint mobility syndrome. The atlanto-occipital joint involvement limits adequate extension of head and neck during laryngoscopy making intubation difficult. The collagen glycosylation starts in the fourth and fifth inter-phalangeal joints. The degree of inter-phalangeal involvement can be assessed by scoring the ink impression made by the palm of the dominant hand (palm print [PP] sign) The aim of our study was to evaluate the PP sign as a screening tool for predicting difficult laryngoscopy in diabetic patients. Methods: A total of 60 diabetic patients undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation were assessed pre-operatively for their airway indices using the modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance, degree of head extension, the PP test and the prayer sign and their corresponding Cormack-Lehane scores were noted. Statistical analysis was performed using Fischer exact test. Results: Of the 60 patients, 15 had positive PP sign. Of the 13 difficult laryngoscopies encountered, 10 patients had a positive PP sign. PP sign was the most sensitive index in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. P =0.000 was obtained and considered as statistically significant. The sensitivity was 76.9%, specificity 89.4%, positive and negative predictive value 71.4% and 91.3% and accuracy 86.7%, respectively. The other signs were not significant in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Conclusion: The PP test appears to be the most sensitive and specific in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in diabetic patients.",1,1
7053319,Anesthetic management of the morbidly obese patient,"Anesthetic management should concentrate on various aspects of pre-, intra-, and postoperative care. Particular laboratory studies, such as arterial blood gases, electrocardiogram, selected pulmonary function tests (e.g., ERV), and serum hepatic profile, can be quite useful. Preoperatively, technical difficulties (intravenous and arterial cannulae, operative positioning, and airway assessment), psychologic considerations, and response to preanesthetic medications can be anticipated. Intraoperative concerns encompass the choice of regional versus general anesthesia, anesthetic biotransformation, and variables influencing intraoperative oxygenation (e.g., effects of general anesthesia, operative position, abdominal packing). Postoperative concerns are directed toward minimizing postoperative hypoxemia, peripheral phlebothrombosis, and fluid imbalances. Special caution is needed in operations subsequent to jejunoileal bypass surgery. Specific choices of anesthetic agents and techniques await further clinical and laboratory investigations in this unique subset of the population.",0,0
10983940,Upper airway complications in children after bone marrow transplantation,"Objective: To describe the upper and lower airway complications in children during bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Study design: Review of medical records of patients requiring airway intervention during BMT over a 4-year period. Results: During the 4-year period, 832 pediatric BMTs were performed. Of these, 87 patients (10.5%) required mechanical ventilation. Patients had intubation for a mean of 79 days (range, -7-638 d) after BMT. Patients received mechanical ventilation for a mean of 12 days (range, 1-85 d). Duration of ventilation was significantly longer in patients with difficult intubation; in these 54 patients there were 64 intubations. Of these intubations, 19 (30%) were difficult. These difficult intubations occurred in 16 (30%) patients. Patients with Hurler syndrome and congenital immunodeficiencies had significantly more difficult intubations than children with leukemia. The incidence of complications causing difficult intubation were difficulty visualizing cords, because of the presence of blood (63%); difficulty visualizing cords, because of edema (19%); anatomically narrowed airway (13%); limited neck extension (13%); and limited jaw opening (6%). The resulting mortality rate was 82% in children requiring intubation. Survivors were significantly younger than nonsurvivors. Conclusions: Pediatric BMT has become increasingly more common. Airway management is rarely required during the engraftment phase, but when intervention is required, it is often difficult, particularly in the nonleukemic child, and may require the skills of an otolaryngologist. Representative cases are presented, and management is discussed.",0,0

10434217,Lightwand intubation does not reduce the increase in intraocular pressure associated with tracheal intubation,"Objective: To evaluate the changes in hemodynamic variables and intraocular pressure (IOP) after tracheal intubation using either lightwand or direct-vision laryngoscopy techniques. Design: Prospective, randomized study. Setting: Inpatient anesthesia at a University Anesthesia Department. Patients: 50 normotensive, ASA physical status I and II patients, without ocular or cardiovascular diseases, and with a Mallampati score no greater than 2. Interventions: After intravenous (i.v.) midazolam premedication (0.05 mg.kg-1), general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (1 microgram.g-1) and thiopental sodium (5 mg.g-1) followed by vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg.g-1), then patients were randomly allocated to receive either the lightwand (Trachlight, n = 25) or direct-vision laryngoscopy (Laryngoscopy, n = 25) intubating techniques. General anesthesia was maintained with 1% isoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen mixture for 5 minutes. Measurements and main results: Baseline hemodynamic variables were recorded 10 minutes after i.v. premedication, and then every minute after tracheal intubation. Intraocular pressure measurements were performed by means of a computerized indentation tonometer after general anesthesia induction and then 1 and 5 minutes after tracheal intubation. In both groups, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate increased from baseline, without differences between the two groups. One minute after intubation, IOP increased in both groups: the mean percentage increase was 32% in the Laryngoscopy group and 16% in the Trachlight group. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Five minutes after intubation, IOP decreased to baseline values in both groups. Conclusion: We conclude that in healthy patients without ocular disease, using a lightwand intubating technique does not reduce the hemodynamic responses and increase in IOP associated with tracheal intubation as compared with conventional direct-vision laryngoscopy.",0,0
21730924,Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for preoperative airway assessment in children with mucopolysaccharidoses,"Background: Accumulation of glycosaminoglycans is known to cause significant problems in the anesthetic management of children with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Clinical and standard radiological evaluation may convey insufficient information about the upper airway and trachea in children with MPS. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images have been used to define the central airway and previous studies have recommended this tool to assess the airway of children who are considered at risk of difficult intubation. However, MDCT has not been recommended in MPS children. The aim of this clinical scenario study was to verify whether information from MDCT reconstruction of the airway is useful in airway management planning of children with MPS. Methods: In a two phase questionnaire-based study, 26 pediatric anesthesiologists were asked to produce airway management plans for 5 children with MPS. An initial plan for airway control was reported after assessment of standard preoperative anesthetic charts. A subsequent airway strategy was then described after reviewing tracheal MDCT images of each patient. Results: MDCT images provided additional clinically-relevant information in 87% (95% CI: 79-92%) of the evaluations. Reduction of tracheal size was the most common finding provided by the MDCT images. After reviewing the MDCT images, anesthesiologists changed their primary airway device selection in 21% of the evaluations (P=0.01). Conclusion: Airway reconstruction using MDCT images from a previous CT scan may provide a useful assessment tool for preoperative airway evaluation and planning in MPS children.",0,0
11766251,Choice of the muscle relaxant for rapid-sequence induction,"Muscle relaxants are given as part of a rapid-sequence induction to facilitate tracheal intubation. Among all the muscle relaxants available, succinylcholine is the only one with a fast (approximately equal to 1 min) onset and a fast recovery. Therefore it is still the most frequently used muscle relaxant for rapid-sequence induction despite its well-known side-effects. The short duration of action of succinylcholine is, however, no substitute for aggressive airway management in the case of an unexpectedly difficult intubation in order to prevent life-threatening hypoxia. A preoperative assessment of the airway is mandatory in any patient and may indicate the need for using intubation techniques without a muscle relaxant. Rocuronium in large doses (i.e. > or = 1 mg kg-1) is an alternative to succinylcholine in a classical rapid-sequence setting under relatively light anaesthesia. With respect to rapid tracheal intubation, the timing and priming principles offer little advantage over the use of rocuronium in doses of 0.6 mg kg-1 in combination with an appropriate induction technique (i.e. including an opioid) or over the use of larger doses of rocuronium (> or = 1.0 mg kg-1) under relatively light anaesthesia, and may even be potentially harmful. In contrast to rocuronium, the use of rapacuronium in a rapid-sequence setting has been associated with dose-dependent respiratory side-effects that limit its usefulness in doses higher than 1.5 mg kg-1 for this indication.",0,0
20031386,Feasibility study of the separation of chlorinated films from plastic packaging wastes,"This study describes the possible separation of chlorinated plastic films (PVC and PVDC) from other heavy plastic packaging waste (PPW) by selective twist formation and gravity separation. Twists formation was mechanically induced in chlorinated plastic films, whereas twist formation did not occur in PS and PET films. After twist formation, all the films had the apparent density of less than 1.0g/cm(3) and floated in water even though the true density was more than 1.0g/cm(3). However, the apparent density of the PS and the PET films increased with agitation to more than 1.0g/cm(3), whereas that of chlorinated plastic films was kept less than 1.0g/cm(3). The main reason would be the air being held inside the chlorinated plastic films which was difficult to be removed by agitation. Simple gravity separation after twist formation was applied for artificial film with 10wt.% of the chlorinated films and real PPW films with 9wt.% of the chlorinated films. About 76wt.% of the artificial PPW films and 75wt.% of real PPW films after the removal of PP and PE were recovered as settling fraction with 4.7wt.% and 3.0wt.% of chlorinated plastic films, respectively. These results indicate that simple gravity separation process after twist formation can be used to reduce the chlorinated plastic concentration from mixed heavy PPW films.",0,0
24723351,Simultaneous decontamination of cross-polluted soils with heavy metals and PCBs using a nano-metallic Ca/CaO dispersion mixture,"In the present work, we investigated the use of nano-metallic calcium (Ca) and calcium oxide (CaO) dispersion mixture for the simultaneous remediation of contaminated soils with both heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, and Pb) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Regardless of soil moisture content, nano-metallic Ca/CaO dispersion mixture achieved about 95-99% of heavy metal immobilization by a simple grinding process. During the same treatment, reasonable PCB hydrodechlorination efficiencies were obtained (up to 97%), though higher hydrodechlorination efficiency by preliminary drying of soil was observed.",0,0
12560311,Increased body mass index per se is not a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy,"Purpose: We investigated the association between morbid obesity and difficult laryngoscopy (DL). Methods: In a prospective, controlled study we evaluated the impact of different variables on the prediction of DL in 200 morbidly obese (study group-SG), and 1272 non-obese (control group-CG) patients undergoing elective surgery. Variables assessed included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), protruding, loose, and missing upper teeth, thyro-mental distance, temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) function, neck extension, and Mallampati class. A Cormack grade III or IV was considered DL. Results: The SG patients were younger (P < 0.000), there were more females in the SG (P < 0.000) and more in the SG had teeth problems (P = 0.026). More patients in the SG (10% vs 1%), had obstructive sleep apnea (P < 0.001) with 90% of them in the SG having a grade III laryngoscopy. High BMI did not affect the laryngoscopy difficulty (P = 0.56). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that morbid obesity, increased age, male sex, pathology of TMJ, and higher Mallampati class, were independent predictors of DL. When interaction between the predictors and the group was added to the multivariable model, the SG was no longer a predictor by itself, rather its association with abnormal upper teeth turned to be significant for prediction of DL. Conclusions: Increased age, male sex, TMJ pathology, Mallampati 3 and 4, a history of obstructive sleep apnea and abnormal upper teeth were associated with a higher incidence of DL. The magnitude of BMI had no influence on difficulty with laryngoscopy.",1,1
12907567,Use of an ultrathin bronchoscope in the assessment of central airway obstruction,"Study objective: To assess the utility of an ultrathin bronchoscope (UB) in the assessment of central airway obstruction (CAO). Design: Prospective evaluation Setting: Tygerberg Hospital, a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients: Consecutive patients referred to the Lung Unit with CAO. Interventions: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was performed with a prototype UB (Olympus BF XP40; Olympus Europe; Hamburg, Germany; outer diameter, 2.8 mm; working channel, 1.2 mm). The UB was used whenever a standard bronchoscope (SB) could not pass the obstruction or could not be tolerated by the patient. Measurements and results: Data relating to indication and performance of FOB, patient demographics, utility in establishing a diagnosis, and planning definitive management were documented. Twenty-four patients (17 men; mean age, 46 years) were studied. Twelve patients (50%) had malignant CAO, 8 patients (33%) had benign tracheal stenosis, 3 patients (12.5%) had stent occlusion, and 1 patient (4%) had bilateral vocal cord paralysis. In 42% of patients, an initial attempt at passing the obstruction with an SB had failed. Vocal cords or trachea were involved in 62% of patients. The mean luminal occlusion was 84% of the total airway lumen (range, 50 to 100%). One complication (desaturation) led to early termination of FOB. In all but three patients with complete obstruction, the UB was able to pass the CAO and allowed assessment of the obstruction and the distal airways (87%). Conclusion: UB-FOB was useful and safe in the assessment of patients with CAO from both benign and malignant disease. It aided in establishing a diagnosis and/or planning of definitive management in all patients examined.",0,0
22118652,[Insufficient preoperative anaesthesiological assessment of dental status],"We conducted a comparison of the preoperative airway and teeth status assessment with a dedicated postoperative assessment. We included 211 patients with a preoperative airway and teeth assessment performed by the designated physicians at the department of anaesthesia. 27% of the patients had an incomplete preoperative assessment. 66% were not informed about the risk of damages to the teeth and 16% of the patients were postoperatively considered to have periodontitis compared to only 3% preoperatively. Postoperatively we found, that many more patients had an overall poor dental status.",0,0
24415391,Angioedema of the upper aerodigestive tract: risk factors associated with airway intervention and management algorithm,"Background: Angioedema of the upper aerodigestive tract can lead to significant airway obstruction. To date no articles have delineated risk factors for progression after initial evaluation. Methods: This article presents the results of a retrospective study of patients with angioedema at a single institution. Patients included were consecutive otolaryngology consultations for angioedema in the emergency department (ED) from 1999 to 2003. All patients were evaluated by an otolaryngologist and underwent fiber-optic laryngoscopy, which was repeated serially depending on findings. Data was collected on demographics, comorbidities, intubation, disposition, and progression of angioedema. Results: A total of 177 patients were included in the study: 32 (18%) patients required intubation; 25 (14%) on initial presentation and 7 (4%) who progressed from an initially stable airway to requiring intervention after reevaluation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated a statistically significant variance between location of edema and rate of intubation, with higher rates in the pharynx and larynx vs the lip and face. Patients who required intubation after progression between serial evaluations were statistically more likely to have edema that involved deeper portions of the aerodigestive tract. Patients who required intubation were statistically more likely to be older (average age 61.8 vs 55.1 years, p = 0.03). Conclusion: In this large series of patients managed for aerodigestive angioedema we demonstrate risk factors associated with airway intervention, and risk factors associated with clinical progression on serial examination to airway intervention. In addition, we demonstrate a successful management algorithm for patients with aerodigestive angioedema.",0,0
1389262,Classification of airway anastomotic healing,Airway complications remain a major problem after lung transplantation. There is no standardised method of assessment of airway healing. We propose a classification of airway healing based on the anastomotic appearances at endoscopy 15 days postoperatively. The system appears to correlate well with the subsequent development of anastomotic sequelae and can be used to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic modalities designed to reduce airway complications.,0,0
24202697,Fatal visit to the dentist,"A 23-year-old woman was mortally afraid of dental interventions and decided to have her four wisdom teeth removed by outpatient surgery under endotracheal anaesthesia. According to the files, the patient was categorized as ASA I and Mallampati II, and surgery was considered an elective routine intervention. Soon after initiation of anaesthesia, O2 saturation and blood pressure dropped, and the young woman died shortly afterwards in spite of immediate resuscitation measures. At first, an allergic reaction to succinylcholine, which had been administered as a muscle relaxant, was suspected. Autopsy and histological examination showed haemorrhagic pulmonary oedema and a defined lesion in the midportion of the oesophageal mucosa in spite of correct placement of the endotracheal breathing tube. Ultimately, misintubation into the oesophagus, which had not been noticed at first, was determined as cause of death.",0,0
16829671,The use of the GlideScope for tracheal intubation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis,"Background: The GlideScopeVideo Laryngoscope is a new intubating device. The aim of the study was to investigate the use of the GlideScopefor tracheal intubation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) undergoing general anaesthesia. Methods: Twenty AS patients were chosen to undergo tracheal intubation by the GlideScope. Preoperative airway assessments were carried out to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. Before intubation all patients were given a modified Cormack and Lehane (MCLS) grade and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score by a separate anaesthetist using a Macintosh size 3 blade. The patients were then intubated, using the GlideScope, by a different anaesthetist during which the larynx was inspected and given another MCLS grade and POGO score. Results: Twelve of the AS patients were judged to have had difficult intubation by preoperative airway assessment. Eleven of the twelve patients had MCLS grades III or IV by direct laryngoscopy and were considered to have had a difficult laryngoscopy. Naso-tracheal intubations by the GlideScope were successful on 17/20 occasions, including 8 of the 11 difficult laryngoscopy. The GlideScope improved the MCLS grade and POGO score in the majority of AS patients compared with direct laryngoscopy (P<0.01). Conclusions: The GlideScope provides a better laryngoscopic view than that of direct laryngoscopy. Most of the AS patients presenting with MCLS grade III or IV by direct laryngoscopy can be intubated successfully by the GlideScope. In elective patients with AS, awake fibreoptic intubation offers a higher level of security because it can be applied while maintaining spontaneous breathing. The use of GlideScope for tracheal intubation may be an alternative option in these patients who prefer their airway management under anaesthesia.",0,0
17491533,Laryngoscopies in the obese: predicting problems and optimizing visualization,"Objectives: This pilot study was designed to 1) identify predictors of difficult laryngeal exposure in obese patients, 2) develop strategies for efficient intubation and intraoperative visualization of the glottis, and 3) devise perioperative protocols for difficult laryngoscopies. Methods: We undertook a retrospective study over a 1-year period of 14 consecutive patients with a body mass index of more than 30 kg/M2 who underwent elective direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia. Measurements of height, weight, neck circumference, Mallampati score, and Cormack-Lehane classification of the airway were recorded. Problems encountered during anesthesia induction and emergence were also noted. The laryngologist recorded on a visual analog scale the degree of difficulty encountered in obtaining a binocular stereoscopic view and magnification, illumination, and suspension. Results: Anatomic challenges during difficult laryngoscopy included decreased neck extension, redundant folds of tissue in the oropharynx and hypopharynx, and upper airway collapsibility. Overall, there was an association between the incidence of difficult laryngeal exposure and the Cormack-Lehane score (r = .57; p = .03), but the Mallampati score was of limited utility to the laryngologist. Neck size in female patients correlated with the Cormack-Lehane score (p = .02). Neither weight nor body mass index were predictive of a difficult laryngeal exposure. Straight blade laryngoscopes with a distal flange allowed greater depth of insertion and provided the best visualization of the glottis. Conclusions: An appropriate clinical examination may help predict a difficult airway. However, further studies are warranted to fully characterize the anatomic predictors of a difficult laryngeal exposure.",1,1
22891444,[Analysis of airway inflammation in asthma: clinical academic interest],"While the importance of airway inflammation in severe asthma was known from the pathologists for more than one century, the demonstration of an airway inflammatory process in mild asthma dates back to the early nineties. With the advent of bronchoscopy making it possible to sample biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage, it has become clear that mild to moderate asthma was characterized by a Th2 driven airway eosinophilic inflammation where cytokine like IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 play a critical role. Soon after, were developed the technique of induced sputum and the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide as non invasive tools to assess airway inflammation. The application of these techniques on large samples of subjects has been instrumental to the development of the concept of inflammatory phenotype in asthma which proved to be pertinent in the drug management of the disease. Therefore, within a 20 year laps, the monitoring of airway inflammation, also called inflammometry, has gone beyond the academic world to become crucial for the appropriate management of asthmatics by the clinician.",0,0
24333051,Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in pharyngeal but not tracheal or laryngeal cross-sectional area: a pilot study using the acoustic reflection method,"Background: The risk of difficult upper airway access is increased during pregnancy, especially in labor. Changes in upper airway calibre have been poorly studied during pregnancy. The acoustic reflection method is a non-invasive technique that allows a longitudinal assessment of the cross-sectional area of the upper airway from the mouth to carina. We used this technique to evaluate upper airway calibre during normal pregnancy. Methods: We conducted a prospective, single centre, observational study with a clinical and upper airway acoustic reflection method evaluation of healthy women during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and up to two days and one month after delivery. Results: Fifty women participated to the study. The mean pharyngeal cross-sectional area decreased between the first and third trimesters (P < 0.001) with no significant change of the minimal and mean tracheal cross-sectional areas. The Mallampati score increased during pregnancy between the first and third trimesters (P< 0.001). Conclusion: Using measurements with the acoustic reflection method, normal pregnancy is associated with a significant reduction in the cross-sectional area of the pharynx and a concomitant increase in the Mallampati score. No change was observed in the minimal and mean tracheal cross-sectional areas.",0,0
21252835,Fibreoptic intubation in awake patients,"Background: Awake fibreoptic intubation has been recommended for adult patients with a difficult airway in whom anaesthesia and/or relaxation could lead to the ""can not ventilate, can not intubate"" situation. The paper describes three cases of elective awake intubations, as examples of our strategy in cases with a predicted difficult airway. Case reports: Three male patients with Mallampati scores 2, 3 and 3, scheduled for elective surgery, were premedicated with 7.5 mg oral midazolam and 0.5 mg iv atropine. With the patient on the operating table in the anti-Trendelenburg position, the upper airways were anaesthetized with 4 mL of topical 2% lidocaine, administered from a nebulizer via face mask. Additionally, the base of the tongue, nasal cavity and lower throat were sprayed with 10% lidocaine solution. Immediately before insertion of the bronchoscope, the patients received intravenously, 2 mg of midazolam and 0.05-0.1 µg kg-1 of fentanyl. A 5.2 mm/65 cm fibreoptic bronchoscope was inserted into the trachea and a reinforced endotracheal tube was slid down over it. Oxygen and additional doses of lidocaine were administered through the working channel of the scope. Conclusion: The described method is safe and effective, and can be recommended for cases where there is serious doubt about the possibility of maintaining an open airway during induction of anaesthesia, or in cases where intubation has failed during previous anaesthesia. Awake intubation is rarely associated with serious episodes of desaturation and it is usually well tolerated by motivated patients.",0,0
19462801,[Successful oral fiberoptic intubation by a double-lumen tube under the ventilation only via nostrils with a child size mask in a patient with limited mouth opening],"A 36-year-old woman was scheduled for the right lower lobe resection under the left one-lung ventilation with a double-lumen tube (DLT). Difficult intubation due to limited (1.5 cm) mouth opening was recognized following the induction of anesthesia. Fiberoptic oral intubation by the DLT was successfully performed under the ventilation via the nostrils using a small-size, child mask covering only the nose (nasal mask). Ventilation was well maintained using the nasal mask, and the gas leakage was coped with tightening the lips with the tube and using a high flow of oxygen. This nasal mask ventilation method is useful and safe in cases of difficult intubation by DLT in which no other proper methods are available.",0,0
27366523,Retrospective Evaluation of Dental Treatment under General Anaesthesia,"Objective: Most dental procedures can be performed with local anaesthesia, however noncompliant paediatric patients, patients with mental retardation or psychiatric disorders, severe anxiety, severe craniofacial anomalies and orofacial trauma may need general anaesthesia. In these patients accompanying central nervous system diseases and airway problems increase the risk of complications. Anaesthesia records of 467 cases of dental surgery performed under general anaesthesia between 2011-2014 is reported with information from the recent literature. Methods: In the study, 467 cases of dental procedures performed under general anaesthesia were taken from the İnönü University of Medicine, Dentistry Disabled Treatment Centre, after approval of the İnönü University Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee. Demographic data, ASA classification, Mallampati (MP) score, duration of surgery, type of intubation and difficulties, comorbid diseases, premedication application, endocarditis prophylaxis, recovery time, analgesia and reasons for general anaesthesia were recorded as mean±standard deviation (SD) or as a number. Results: The mean age of the patients was 16.78±12 years and the female/male ratio was 277/190 (59.3%/40.7%). Of the 467 patients, 219 (46.9%) were classified as ASA I, 234 (50.1%) as ASA II and 14 (3%) as ASA III. Furthermore, 182 (38.9%) patients with mental retardation, 33 (7.1%) with cerebral palsy and 28 (6%) with autism were identified. The mean operative time was 114.53±35.4 min, and the average recovery time 40.4±6 was min. Of the endotracheal intubations 277 (59.3%) were oral, 82 (17.6%) were nasal, and 108 (23.1%) were nasal with the help of fibreoptics. Difficult intubation was observed in 20 (4.3%) patients. The MP score was 1 in 397 (85%) patients, 2 in 50 (10.7%) patients, 3 in 18 (3.9%) patients and 4 in 2 (0.4%) patients. General anaesthesia was applied because of cooperation difficulties in 213 (45.6%), mental retardation in 182 (38.9%), autism in 28 (5.9%), schizophrenia in 7 (1.7%) and jaw surgery in 37 (7.9%) patients. Local infiltration was used for analgesia in 141 (30.2%), morphine in 12 (2.6%), tramadol in 3 (0.6%) and paracetamol in 311 (66.6%) patients. Endocarditis prophylaxis was employed in 36 (7.7%) cases. Conclusion: General anaesthesia in dental procedures is becoming increasingly common. Anaesthetic management is important due to the frequency of genetic syndromes and mental retardation. In the anaesthetic management of these patients, strategies for the patient should be identified, the process should be implemented in the operating room and preparations should be made with risk analyses.",0,0
10812413,Anesthetic management of the patient undergoing head and neck cancer surgery,"The head and neck cancer patient should be in the best possible medical condition before facing surgery, bearing in mind the status of the tumor and the urgency of the procedure. Careful assessment of the patient's upper airway will enable the anesthesiologist to select an appropriate course of action to secure the airway before the operation begins. In many cases, the patient can be safely intubated after the induction of general anesthesia. In other situations, the patient may require an examination of the airway while awake with the aid of sedation and topical analgesia to determine the safest intubation technique. If the patient has evidence of a difficult airway, a flexible fiberoptic-guided intubation may be indicated to secure the airway in the awake patient patient before general anesthesia is induced. Some patients with severe airway obstruction or large, bulky supraglottic tumors usually undergo an initial tracheostomy with local anesthesia to secure the airway. Following surgery, extubation of the patient's trachea requires careful attention and may have to be performed over a jet-ventilating stylet.",0,0
10078410,Wire-guided endobronchial blockade in a patient with a limited mouth opening,"Purpose: We report the use of wire-guided endobronchial blockade, a new method of achieving one-lung ventilation, in a patient requiring awake, nasal, fibreoptic intubation for resection of a lung carcinoma. Clinical report: A 43-yr-old woman with limited mouth opening, from severe TMJ dysfunction, required a right thoracotomy for right upper lobe wedge resection. One-lung ventilation was accomplished using a new type of wire-guided endobronchial blocker. The device was placed coaxially through the endotracheal tube using a pediatric bronchoscope through a special bronchoscopy port. Conclusion: Effective one-lung ventilation was achieved using this system. The system may prove advantageous in clinical situations where placement of double lumen endotracheal tubes or Univent tubes is technically impractical or impossible.",0,0
18985370,Preoperative clinical prediction of difficult laryngeal exposure in suspension laryngoscopy,"We investigated general and physical predictors of difficult laryngeal exposure in patients undergoing suspension laryngoscopy; 93 patients were included in this prospective study. The patients were classified as difficult laryngeal exposure group or non-difficult laryngeal exposure group based on the laryngeal view in suspension laryngoscopy. Twelve parameters (age, sex, body mass index, neck circumference, full mouth opening, modified mallampati index, hyoid-mental, thyroid-mental, horizontal thyroid-mental, vertical thyroid-mental, sternum-mental distance) that could predict difficult laryngeal exposure were evaluated. Of 93 patients, 22 had difficult laryngeal exposure. Cormack-Lehane score, neck circumference, body mass index, modified mallampati index, hyoid-mental, thyroid-mental, vertical thyroid-mental, and sternum-mental distance showed significant correlation with difficult laryngeal exposure. Based on the multivariate analysis, neck circumference superior to 40 cm, hyoid-mental and sternum-mental distance with respectively a value less than 6.05 and 13.9 cm were independently associated with difficult laryngeal exposure. Muscular neck, hyoid-mental and sterno-mental distance should be considered clinical predictors of difficult laryngeal exposure. Measurements of physical variables at full extension position of the neck are more useful and reliable predictors than neutral position for the risk of difficult laryngeal exposure.",0,0
21334240,[Use of topical pharyngeal anaesthesia in esophagogastroduodenoscopy in unsedated patients],"Aim: Evaluation of effect on tolerance of topical pharyngeal anaesthesia with a lidocaine spray in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and possible secondary factors that could influence it. Methods: A prospective, experimental, randomized, open-label study was performed in our Endoscopy Unit during January 2010. Outpatients (109) were recruited prospectively and randomized between two groups: L group (52), who received lidocaine (50 mg Xilonibsa 10% before examination), and C group (57) who did not. Sedated patients were not included in this study. Age, sex, Mallampati index (lower I and II; higher III and IV), endoscopist, complications and score (0-100; visual analogue scale) was recorded after each EGD. Results: There were no statistical differences between the two groups as regards patient tolerance. However in stratified analysis the application of lidocaine modified the results in two out of the six endoscopists and improved the scores in patients with a higher Mallampati Index (L group 61.8 ± 24 and C group 47.7 ± 32). Significant differences were also observed in the scores on patient tolerance between the endoscopist (operator dependent factor), regardless of the use of topical pharyngeal anaesthesia or not. Conclusions: The systematic use of lidocaine in EGD is safe but does not improve the tolerance in all outpatients. Only the Mallampati index has been identified as a prognosis factor of good response to lidocaine administration. Additionally the nursing-endoscopist could be a very important factor in the scores obtained independently of lidocaine.",0,0
26665459,[Study of building up a comprehensive system for predicting difficult laryngeal exposure under suspension laryngoscopy],"Objective: To build up a simple and effective comprehensive system for predicting difficult laryngeal exposure under suspension laryngoscopy. Method: One hundred and twenty cases of laryngeal tubor were selected. Using Logistic regression method to analyse relative factors, including weight, height, BMI, neck girth, neck upward degree, upper-lower incisor teeth distance, thyroid-mentum distance, thyroid-sternum distance, Mallampati test, Yamamoto test and Upper lip bite test. Build data-base to construct a comprehensive system for predicting difficult laryngeal exposure under suspension laryngoscopy. Result: The relative factors of difficult laryngeal exposure were BMI, neck girth, upper-lower incisor teeth distance, neck upward degree, thyroid-mentum distance, Mallampati test and Yamamoto test (P < 0.05). To build up a comprehensive system for predicting difficult laryngeal exposure under suspension laryngoscopy. The predicting standards included the seven relative factors, each factor has 1 score, 2 score, 3 score. Higher score means more risk. Eight score was designed as minimum, under the premise,the sensibility, misdiagnosis rate, missed misdiagnosis rate, specificity of the experiment were 95.5%, 5.3%, 4.5%, 94.7%. Conclusion: The comprehesive system is an effective method for predicting difficult intubation. It can help to identify difficult cases according to the results of this predicting system.",0,0
21381580,The predictors of difficult tracheal intubations in patients undergoing thyroid surgery for euthyroid goitre,"Objective: To evaluate the influence of goitre on anatomic features and the correlation of these changes with difficulty in intubation. Methods: A questionnaire was employed to assess 139 patients scheduled for elective surgery of euthyroid goitre to predict the potential of difficult intubation. These measurements were later correlated with the patients who eventually had difficult intubations. Neck circumference, mouth width, lip test, sternomental distance, thymomental distance, Mallampati score and laryngeal palpation were evaluated. Results: All predictors were found to be significant as single predictors but on logistic regression analysis it was found that the circumference of the neck alone, was the independent predictor for difficult intubation. Conclusion: Neck thickness in patients with goitre is a significant predictor of difficult intubation and should be used in preoperative assessment to anticipate difficult intubations.",0,0
12496724,Fibre-optic awake intubation for caesarean section in a parturient with predicted difficult airway,"Anaesthetic management of a parturient with predicted difficult airway presenting for caesarean section (CS) is not a straightforward decision: general anaesthesia should be avoided because intubation can be impossible and a ""cannot intubate, cannot ventilate"" scenario might ensue, on the other hand regional techniques can be unsuccessful or, though rarely, have complications that require emergency intubation. The case is presented of a primigravida admitted to hospital at 37 weeks' gestation with hypertension, intrauterine growth retardation and oligohydramnios. After a few days' observation, it was decided to proceed with an elective CS. The preoperative airway examination revealed a poor mouth opening with an interdental distance of 20 mm and a Mallampati class IV. The patient was classified as a case of difficult intubation and the following anaesthetic options were considered: epidural anaesthesia, spinal anaesthesia and awake fibreoptic intubation followed by general anaesthesia. The pros and the cons of these techniques were explained to the patient and it was suggested that awake fibreoptic intubation was the safest option. The patient gave her consent, so an uneventful nasal awake fibreoptic intubation was carried out under local anaesthesia. This case report offers the opportunity to underline the risk to perform a central blockade in a parturient with predicted difficult intubation, arguing that the safest course of action is an awake fibrescopic intubation, besides some controversial points to safely perform awake fibreoptic intubation in obstetric patients are discussed.",0,0
20547033,Goitre and difficulty of tracheal intubation,"Objectives: To assess the difficulty in both laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation related to goitre and to identify factors predictive of difficult intubation due to this condition. Study design: Prospective observational. Methods: We used the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS) in 80 consecutive patients with large goitre (defined by the inability to palpate the cricoid cartilage, the presence of endothoracic goitre, tracheal deviation of more than 1cm or tracheal stenosis on the chest x-ray) and 77 control patients. Results: Cormack grades 3-4 were more frequent at initial laryngoscopy in patients with goitre (23/80 vs. 9/77; p<0.05), but the difference was no longer significant after application of an external laryngeal pressure (8/80 vs. 5/77). IDS scores (median [25th-75th percentiles]) were higher in the goitre group (1 [0 - 4]) than in the control group (0 [0 - 1]; p=0.001), corresponding to an increase in slightly difficult intubation (IDS 1-5: 36/80 vs. 15/77; p<0.05). However, incidence of moderate to major difficulty in intubation (IDS>5: 8/80 vs. 7/77) as well as time to completion of intubation were similar in both groups. Tracheal stenosis (> or =30%) and reduced mouth opening (<4.4cm) were the only significant predictors of increased difficulty in intubation in patients with a goitre. Conclusion: Large goitres are usually associated with slight difficulty in intubation only. Increased difficulty should be expected when severe tracheal stenosis is present on chest x-ray, especially when associated with a reduced mouth opening.",1,1
8250366,[Use of fiberoptic bronchoscope for difficult intubation in maxillofacial surgery],"This retrospective study analyzed the cases of difficult intubations carried out with a fiberoptic bronchoscope between March 1984 and May 1989. During this period, 222 such procedures were attempted in 131 male and 68 female patients. All cases were diagnosed at the preoperative visit. A fiberoptic bronchoscope was used as a guide under topical nasal and laryngeal anaesthesia, together with appropriate benzodiazanalgesia, in order to maintain spontaneous breathing. The nasotracheal route was used in 218 cases. Successful intubation was achieved in 219 cases (98.6%), 209 of them (95.4%) within fifteen minutes. Of the three failures, only one was unpredictable (inability to withdraw the fiberoptic bronchoscope from the endotracheal tube). In the two others, the technique was subsequently found to have been wrongly indicated: major nasopharyngeal secretions occluded the fiberoptic device in the first one, and an anatomically compromised airway led to apnoea under sedation in the other. A narrow nasotracheal passage, spreading oedema, bloody secretions or coughing gave rise to technical difficulties in 39 cases (17.5%). There was one case of regurgitation without any drawback. Benzodiazanalgesia was responsible for two cases of respiratory depression. This technique was otherwise very satisfactory, patients being cooperative and frequently having amnesia of intubation. The indications for the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope were: insufficient oral opening, orofacial obstacles to laryngoscopy, and cases where laryngoscopy had to be avoided. The main drawbacks of this technique were the cost and fragility of fiberoptic device as well as operator efficiency. The anaesthesiologists involved in the present series performed ten easy intubations each with the fiberoptic bronchoscope, and routinely used the teaching eye-piece.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
18310629,Brief review: the Cobra Perilaryngeal Airway (CobraPLA and the Streamlined Liner of Pharyngeal Airway (SLIPA) supraglottic airways,"Purpose: To summarize the published literature related to two, new supraglottic airways (SGAs): the Cobra Perilaryngeal Airway (CobraPLA) and the Streamlined Liner of Pharyngeal Airway (SLIPA). Source: We identified original articles, through searches on Medline and PubMed, using the keywords 'Cobra', 'CobraPLA', 'Cobra-PLA', 'PLA', and 'SLIPA'. Principal findings: Searches identified 28 publications evaluating the CobraPLA, six of which were randomized, controlled trials. Five publications evaluated the SLIPA, two of which were randomized, controlled trials. Studies compared the CobraPLA with a number of SGAs, in regards to both efficacy and safety. While the CobraPLA is comparable to the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) Classic, with respect to insertion times and the incidence and severity of sore throat, the CobraPLA is superior, with respect to airway sealing pressure, and has been used successfully in patients with limited mouth opening and limited head extension. Insertion times, first insertion success rates, recovery times, and hemodynamic responses, associated with insertion of the SLIPA, are similar to those of the LMA Proseal. Although the SLIPA has a unique reservoir chamber to contain regurgitated fluid, the extent of its protection against pulmonary aspiration has not been established in the clinical setting. Conclusion: Both the CobraPLA and the SLIPA are intended for use during short procedures under general anesthesia, and have comparable efficacy and complication rates in comparison to the LMA Classic. Both airways may be considered as primary SGA devices, and the CobraPLA may be also be used as a rescue airway device.",0,0
26607193,Bilateral total hip replacement in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita,"The authors present a case of bilateral total hip replacements (THRs) in a 56-year-old patient with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The considerations for the perioperative period and the outcome are discussed. Preoperative planning included an anaesthetic review and availability of fiberoptic intubation due to poor mouth opening. Perioperatively, contractures can make positioning and exposure difficult but in this case a standard posterior approach was taken. Particular attention was given to soft tissue balancing given the theoretical risk of dislocation. There were no perioperative complications. Postoperatively there has been improvement in pain and hip scores but the patient has failed to return to work. Objective improvements in range of motion (ROM) have not been made. This experience suggests THR is a safe and effective treatment for osteoarthritic hip pain in patients with AMC but patients should be informed that ROM is unlikely to improve.",0,0
25010615,"Does the STOP-Bang, an obstructive sleep apnea screening tool, predict difficult intubation?","Objective: A close relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and difficult intubation has been suggested. We hypothesized that the STOP-Bang questionnaire, a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), can predict difficult intubation. Patients and methods: In this prospective cohort study, 200 adult surgical patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were studied to evaluate the usefulness of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for predicting difficult intubation. STOP-Bang questionnaire results, Mallampati score and tonsil size, as well as demographic data, were recorded preoperatively. Cormack & Lehane grading and difficulty of intubation (Cormack & Lehane grade III or IV, need of an intubation aid, or need of three or more intubation attempts) were also evaluated. Results: Eighty-three out of 200 patients had a high risk of OSA based on the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The occurrence of difficult intubation was higher in the patients at a high risk of OSA (i.e., a STOP-Bang score of ≥ 3) than in the patients at a low risk (13.3% vs. 2.6%) (p = 0.004). Higher age, greater weight, higher body mass index, greater neck circumference, male gender, presence of comorbidities, lower preoperative SpO2, longer extubation times, higher Mallampati score, higher Cormack & Lehane grading, tonsil size and difficult intubation were significantly correlated with a high risk of OSA (p < 0.001). Fourteen out of 200 patients had difficulty in intubation. A STOP-Bang score of ≥ 3 was seen more frequently in the difficult intubation patients (78.6% vs. 38.7%) (p = 0.009). Greater weight, greater neck circumference, greater Mallampati score, a STOP-Bang score ≥ 3 and male gender were significantly correlated with difficult intubation (p < 0.05). Conclusions: A STOP-Bang score of ≥ 3 was a predictor for difficult intubation.",0,0
22374390,A survey of anaesthetic practice in predicting difficult intubation in UK and Europe,"Context: Unexpected difficulty in tracheal intubation is an intermittent and often terrifying problem for all practising anaesthetists. There are many preoperative assessment tests to predict a difficult laryngeal view or a difficult intubation, but we found no published evidence of how frequently these predictive tests are used or how useful they are perceived to be by anaesthetists. Objective: We decided to ask UK and non-UK anaesthetists attending the Annual Scientific Meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiology about their practice in predicting difficult intubation. Design: The study was conceived as a survey. Setting: The airway tests were compiled into a questionnaire, hand distributed among anaesthetists at Euroanaesthesia - the European group (after excluding UK attendees) - and posted to randomly selected anaesthetists in the UK - the UK group. Participants: Overall, 888 of 1230 (72%) questionnaires were completed. The response rate from the UK group of anaesthetists was 69% (481 of 700) and from the European group was 77% (407 of 530). Results: On a scale 1 (never) to 5 (always), the mean score for frequency of use was similar for both groups of anaesthetists and ranged from about 4 for mouth opening to about 1 for Nodding Donkey. The mean score for usefulness (1 = useless, 5 = extremely useful) ranged from about 3.7 to 2 for the same two tests. The UK group found most tests slightly less useful than did the European group. With regard to the frequency of assessing the airway, 9% of the European group, but 16% of the UK group, failed always (score 5) or regularly (score 4) to assess the airway before general anaesthesia. Furthermore, 21 and 36% of the UK and European groups, respectively, failed to do so before regional anaesthesia. Conclusion: These results are a cause for concern with regard to both airway management training and patient safety.",0,0
9620912,Exhaled nitric oxide in human lung transplantation. A noninvasive marker of acute rejection,"Acute allograft rejection in animals and humans has been associated with increased nitric oxide production in the graft. Exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) measurement is a noninvasive method of assessing inflammation in airway diseases, e.g., asthma, which might be applicable to lung transplant recipients. Over 12 months, ENO of lower respiratory origin was measured in 108 lung transplant recipients with a mean time after transplant of 1,083 d. ENO (mean +/- SEM; ppb) in stable patients (19.5 +/- 1.1; p < 0.001) was not different from that of healthy controls (23.8 +/- 3.2). ENO was significantly higher in episodes of clinical acute rejection (51.1 +/- 6.3) compared with stable patients but not elevated in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (18.6 +/- 1.5) or pulmonary infection (25.9 +/- 4.0). A retrospective analysis of bronchoscopy findings and concurrent ENO (n = 99) showed that ENO did not vary according to histological findings (normal, acute rejection grade I, nonspecific inflammatory change) or with a positive BAL culture. ENO was not correlated with differential lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. ENO appears to be a valid marker of clinical acute rejection in human lung transplantation as distinct from infection or bronchiolitis obliterans. Furthermore, bronchoscopic findings in the absence of a clinical illness were not associated with a rise in ENO.",0,0
18091340,Waist circumference and sleep disordered breathing,"Objectives/hypothesis: To explore how the different metrics of obesity, specifically body mass index (BMI), Mallampati, neck circumference, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio, correlate with metrics of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), specifically the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), and which is/are the most likely to predict and correlate with SDB. Study design and methods: Four hundred fourteen patients presenting to the University of California San Diego Head and Neck Surgery Clinic for SDB had a sleep evaluation including a history and physical examination assessing the markers of obesity and a sleep test. Data comparing AHI with BMI, neck circumference, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and Mallampati were analyzed by means, standard deviations, and Pearson's correlations. Results: The mean AHI for males was 34, and the mean AHI for females was 24. The mean age was 48 for both sexes. The mean waist circumference for males was 104 cm (41 inches) and for females 99 cm (39 inches). In males and females, waist measurement was most strongly correlated with SDB (males: r = 0.366, P = .00; females: r = 0.445, P = .00). The mean neck circumference for males and females was 43 cm (17 inches) and 38 cm (15 inches) (males: r = 0.358, P = .00; females: r = 0.38, P = .00). The mean waist-hip ratio for males and females was 0.94 and 0.87 (males: r = 0.359, P = .00; females: r = 0.254, P = .03). The mean BMI for males and females was 31 kg/m2 (males: r = 0.325, P = .00; females: r = 0.40, P = .00), and the mean Mallampati for males and females was 2.84 and 2.92 (males: r = 0.176, P = .012; females: r = 0.149, P = .16). A linear regression demonstrated that waist and neck circumference were better correlates of SDB than BMI. Conclusion: Obesity correlates with SDB severity. Waist circumference is a better measure than BMI or neck circumference to predict SDB. Men and women are anthropometrically different. Even with an AHI of 5 or more, only half of SDB patients in this study were clinically obese. An abnormal waist circumference for men and women is 102 cm (40 inches) or more.",0,0
22487656,Lipid signaling in Drosophila photoreceptors,"Drosophila photoreceptors are sensory neurons whose primary function is the transduction of photons into an electrical signal for forward transmission to the brain. Photoreceptors are polarized cells whose apical domain is organized into finger like projections of plasma membrane, microvilli that contain the molecular machinery required for sensory transduction. The development of this apical domain requires intense polarized membrane transport during development and it is maintained by post developmental membrane turnover. Sensory transduction in these cells involves a high rate of G-protein coupled phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)] hydrolysis ending with the activation of ion channels that are members of the TRP superfamily. Defects in this lipid-signaling cascade often result in retinal degeneration, which is a consequence of the loss of apical membrane homeostasis. In this review we discuss the various membrane transport challenges of photoreceptors and their regulation by ongoing lipid signaling cascades in these cells. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipids and Vesicular Transport.",0,0
11069806,Influence of simultaneous neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy on bronchoscopic findings and lung function in patients with locally advanced proximal esophageal cancer,"To assess the bronchoscopic and lung function changes induced by preoperative radiochemotherapy (30 Gy radiation and 5-fluorouracil) in patients with proximal esophageal cancer, we prospectively compared the findings in 77 consecutive patients before and after the therapy. All patients completed the radiochemotherapy protocol; toxicity was minimal. Sixty-four patients underwent surgery, 48 had total gross removal of disease, and six had a complete histologic response. Of the 13 patients who developed apparent direct macroscopic signs of tumor invasion into the airways during therapy, histologic proof of cancer was obtained in only one of the abnormalities. Bronchoscopy was falsely negative in six patients in whom airway invasion of the cancer was found at surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy led to no systematic changes in the appearance of the uninvolved tracheal mucosa; microscopically, an increase in postinflammatory changes, hyperplasia, and metaplasia was found. There was no significant change in the values of lung function parameters after the therapy. No patient developed symptoms suggestive of radiation-induced lung changes, although in one of them, subtle radiologic features consistent with radiation pneumonitis were found. No patient died of postoperative pulmonary complications. The interpretation of bronchoscopy in the assessment of airway invasion of esophageal cancer after radiochemotherapy is more difficult than at baseline staging; the positive predictive value of macroscopic abnormalities without microscopic proof of cancer is low, and even with extensive sampling for histology and cytology, the procedure was falsely negative in 9.4%. Neoadjuvant therapy did not induce radiation pneumonitis or changes in lung function that could be of concern at the following operation.",0,0
27034926,"Airway Management with Cervical Spine Immobilisation: A Comparison between the Macintosh Laryngoscope, Truview Evo2, and Totaltrack VLM Used by Novices--A Manikin Study","Airway management in patients with suspected cervical spine injury plays an important role in the pathway of care of trauma patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate three different airway devices during intubation of a patient with reduced cervical spine mobility. Forty students of the third year of emergency medicine studies participated in the study (F = 26, M = 14). The time required to obtain a view of the entry to the larynx and successful ventilation time were recorded. Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopic view and damage to the incisors were also assessed. All three airway devices were used by each student (a novice) and they were randomly chosen. The mean time required to obtain the entry-to-the-larynx view was the shortest for the Macintosh laryngoscope 13.4 s (±2.14). Truview Evo2 had the shortest successful ventilation time 35.7 s (±9.27). The best view of the entry to the larynx was obtained by the Totaltrack VLM device. The Truview Evo2 and Totaltrack VLM may be an alternative to the classic Macintosh laryngoscope for intubation of trauma patients with suspected injury to the cervical spine. The use of new devices enables achieving better laryngoscopic view as well as minimising incisor damage during intubation.",0,0
22361488,Video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for double-lumen endotracheal tube intubation: a retrospective analysis,"Objective: The authors hypothesized that video laryngoscopy (VL) facilitated double-lumen tube (DLT) insertion compared with direct laryngoscopy (DL). Design: A retrospective analysis. Setting: An academic hospital. Participants: Patients older than 18 years of age undergoing thoracic surgery requiring DLT placement between 2005 and 2011. Interventions: Patients without airway predictors of difficult intubation who were intubated under DL with Macintosh (DL-MAC, n = 40) or Miller (DL-MIL, n = 44) blades and VL with McGrath MAC (Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, UK) and C-MAC (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) laryngoscopes (n = 46) were included in the study. Patients who were intubated with both VL devices were grouped into a VL group. Measurements: Patients in all 3 groups had comparable preoperative demographics. Mallampati scores and ease of manual ventilation after the induction of anesthesia were also similar in all groups. The Cormack Lehane (C-L) grade views were significantly higher in patients in the DL-MAC than in the DL-MIL and VL groups (p < 0.006). The number of intubation attempts was similar in all 3 groups; however, the percentage of intubation reported to be difficult was higher in the DL-MAC than in the other 2 groups (p = 0.014). No damage to the airway was found in any of the groups. Conclusion: DLT placement using VL appeared to overcome some of the limitations of DL-MAC but was similar to DL-MIL. The authors speculated that the ease of placement was related to the improved visualization of the vocal cords because there was a significantly greater number of C-L views 3 and 4 in the DL-MAC group as compared with the VL and DL-MIL groups. Hence, the authors advocate using VL, particularly when the laryngoscopist is inexperienced using DL-MIL for DLT placement.",0,0
26767232,A comparative evaluation of the Airtraq and King Vision video laryngoscope as an intubating aid in adult patients,"Airtraq has been shown to improve ease of intubation in patients with normal and difficult airway. King Vision video laryngoscope is a newly introduced intubating device with an attached monitor. We here hypothesized that the King Vision video laryngoscope with channeled blade performs better during intubation as compared to Airtraq. In this study, we performed a comparison between the King Vision video laryngoscope and the Airtraq with regard to time needed for intubation, number of attempts required to intubate, and complications. Fifty ASA grade I and II adult patients posted for a routine surgical procedure were randomly divided into two groups of 25 patients each. All patients were anesthetized using similar techniques. The time required to intubate patients was significantly shorter when the King Vision video laryngoscope with channeled blade was used as compared to the Airtraq (p < 0.05). The number of attempts to successfully intubate patients was also significantly lower (p < 0.05) for the King Vision video laryngoscope than for the Airtraq. The use of the Kings Vision video laryngoscope with channeled blade should be encouraged in difficult intubation situations in adult patients with a mouth opening of more than 18 mm.",0,0
18634954,Prevalence and prediction of difficult intubation in maxillofacial surgery patients,"Purpose: The failure to maintain a patent airway after the induction of general anesthesia is a major concern for anesthesiologists. For securing the airway, tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy remains the method of choice in most cases. However, direct laryngoscopic intubation is difficult in 1% to 4%, and impossible in 0.05% to 0.35%, of patients who have seemingly normal airways. This study sought to determine the prevalence of difficult intubation in maxillofacial surgery patients, and to evaluate the usefulness of various predictive tests for difficult intubation. Patients and methods: This study was conducted on 208 patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery. During the preoperative visit, patients were examined in terms of the test of Mallampati et al (Can Anaesth Soc J 32:429, 1985), thyromental distance, sternomental distance, and interincisal distance. Direct laryngoscopic grading, as defined by Cormack and Lehane (Anesthesia 39:1105, 1984), was recorded for each patient. An intubation of ""no difficulty"" was noted when the tube was inserted into the fully visualized larynx with little effort on the first attempt. Results: Intubation was possible in all patients. Combinations of different predictive tests resulted in higher sensitivity. Among all test types, that of Cormack and Lahene was thought to exhibit the highest sensitivity and positive predictive values when used alone. The prevalence of difficult intubation in our group of maxillofacial surgery patients was 15.4%. It may be concluded that a combination of predictive variables can be used to improve sensitivity. Conclusions: We demonstrated that combining the Mallampati test with other instruments of measurement resulted in higher sensitivity than when either test was used alone.",1,1
1545494,[Perioperative management of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for the obstructive sleep apnea patient],"The perioperative courses of 10 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty were reported. No hypnotic was administered at night before operation. Premedication consisted of atropine 0.5 mg, meperidine 35 mg, given i.m. 1 hr prior to surgery. No patients developed respiratory depression after premedication. General anesthesia was induced with iv thiopental, and succinylcholine was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Airway management was technically difficult in all patients. Anesthesia was maintained with N2O-O2-enflurane under controlled ventilation. At the end of the surgery the insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway was performed for the prevention of airway obstruction. In 8 patients it was possible to remove the airway in the next morning. Dexamethasone was administered 3 times to reduce pharyngeal edema during perioperative period. Trachea was extubated when the patient was fully awake and alert. Perioperatively the following points are important in the management of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. 1. Assessment of airway and the method of airway control. 2. Reduction of pharyngeal edema. 3. Using caution against the postoperative hemorrhage. 4. Avoidance of sedation. 5. Close observation extending into the postoperative period.",0,0
8999376,[Difficult intubation in paediatric cardiac surgery. Significance of age. Association with Down's syndrome],"Objective: To assess the relationship between the age of pediatric patients and the likelihood of difficult intubations and to confirm the importance of Down Syndrome causing difficult intubations. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Pediatric cardiac surgery operating room. Patients: 627 pediatric patients, suffering from congenital heart disease, operated in our hospital from 1992 to 1994, divided in three age groups (under 1 month, between 1 month and 1 year, over 1 year of age). Interventions: Translaryngeal intubation performed in the operating room before the operation. Measurements: The percentage of difficult intubations was assessed in the three age groups and the association with Down syndrome was also considered. The likelihood of orotracheal intubations in each of the preceding groups was also examined. Conclusions: The percentage of difficult intubation in our experience was estimated to be 4.62%. Intubation's difficulty increases with decreasing age of non Down patients. The risk of difficult intubation in Down patients is, irrespectively of age, nearly 27% higher than in non-Downs (5.77% versus 4.52). However Down Syndrome seems to be important only in the age group between one month and one year. The percentage of orotracheal intubations in the preceding groups, even if indirectly, seem to confirm this observation.",0,0
8992906,[The transillumination technique. An alternative to conventional intubation?],"The technique of light-guided intubation is based on the principle that a source of light brought into the trachea results in clearly visible and defined transcutaneous illumination, while no illumination can be observed with the light source in the oesophagus (Fig. 1-7). The Trachlight is a reintroduced instrument for this alternative intubation technique. The essential developments are: a length-adjustable stylet with a removable internal metal wire, a brighter light source, a stable handle with tight fixation of the endotracheal tube, and a time-dependent warning device to avoid extended intubations. One hundred twenty patients (Mallampati I. ASA I-III) were included in the study (conventional intubation [group KL, n = 60]. Trachlight intubation [group TT, n = 60]. The goals of the investigation were to examine the handling, application, problems, limitations, and possible indications of the method. The recorded parameters were: number of intubation attempts: course and duration of intubation; complications; and difficulties. In 40 patients (20 in each group) the indication for invasive blood pressure measurement was given due to the surgical procedure, and circulatory parameters were recorded at defined moments during the intubation course. In group KL 55 patients were intubated in the attempt, 4 on the second, and 1 on the third (mean duration 23.6 +/- 10.4 s, range 12-60 s). Complications were: unilateral intubation (3 patients), bradycardia (2), asystole (1) and soft-tissue injury (1). Of the 60 patients in group TT. 54 were intubated successfully, the mean time needed being 29.9 +/- 14.8 s (range: 6-61 s). The remaining 6 were then intubated by the conventional method. Positive results in group TT included: easy handling and application, no injury to soft tissues or teeth, and invariably correct placement of the tube. Problems included: sufficient transillumination was achieved only after (entire) dimming of the room, insufficient control over the distal end of the tube due to an unfixed metal wire, unintentional switching off of the light while with-drawing the metal wire, difficulties in withdrawing the metal wire (too strong fixation), as well as disturbing effects of the warning device (blinking of the light 30 s after switching on). Reasons for the 6 intubation failures were introduction of the instrument into the oesophagus despite a supposed correct position, impossibility of correct placement in a patient with an extremely large goiter, and insufficiently clear transillumination in 3 extremely obese patients. The cardiovascular parameters showed no changes during laryngeal manipulation; a clear rise in heart rate and blood pressure was recorded, however, when the tube was inserted into the trachea. The cardiovascular parameters during conventional intubations were similar. The light-guided intubation technique can be regarded as a further alternative for airway management, due to the described improvement of the instrument. The indication for the technique is given in patients in whom no difficulty with intubation is expected, to avoid soft tissue damage and traumatising temporomandibular joint movements. Preclinical use may be limited due to environmental brightness. In patients with expected difficult airway management, fiberoptic intubation will remain the method of choice.",0,0
21384653,[Successful tracheal intubation using the pediatric Airtraq optical laryngoscope in a pediatric patient with Robin sequence],"We report a successful use of pediatric Airtraq optical laryngoscope in a pediatric patient with Robin sequence. Robin sequence accompanies a characteristic facies and its clinical presentation is marked by micrognathia, retrognathia, glossoptosis, and respiratory obstruction. A 1-year-5 month-old boy with Robin sequence was scheduled for palate repair under general anesthesia. After anesthetic induction with thiopental and neuromuscular paralysis with rocuronium, initial laryngeal view with the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope was Cormack-Lehane grade II due to restricted mouth opening and micrognathia. The Airtraq Pedi provided the glottic view with Cormack-Lehane grade I and a preformed tracheal tube (ID 4 mm) was placed correctly into the trachea through the built-in tube channel. We conclude that the pediatric Airtraq has potential advantages over conventional direct laryngoscopy in children with difficult airway.",0,0
25599025,Postoperative alterations in taste and smell,"Context: Alterations in taste and smell, including but not limited to anosmia, ageusia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia, have been described in association with various medications, including anesthetic agents. Frequently, these symptoms occur 1-2 weeks after medication administration and last several months. While such a phenomenon is a rare occurrence, it nonetheless can significantly impact patients' satisfaction and quality of life. Evidence acquisition: The methodology consisted of a thorough literature search using the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases utilizing keywords such as anosmia, ageusia, olfactory disorders, postoperative, and anesthesia. Results: Our results yielded several previously published case report, and were not limited to a specific type of anesthesia. Based on available literature, we review the physiology of taste and smell as well as the medications associated with loss of these senses. We describe perioperative agents that could lead to postoperative complications associated with anosmia and and ageusia. Conclusions: Based on available literature recommendations for anesthesiologists caring for patients at risk for this occurrence are presented in this review. The symptoms are usually temporary as in the majority of the patients the sensory receptor cells are able to regenerate themselves after injury. Anesthesia providers need to aware of this phenomenon to be able to reassure patients and possibly avoid anesthetic techniques associated with anosmia and ageusia.",0,0
17287926,Hyoid bone and laryngeal movement dependent upon presence of a tracheotomy tube,"The aim of this prospective, consecutive study was to investigate the biomechanical effects, if any, of the presence of a tracheotomy tube and tube cuff status, tube capping status, and aspiration status on movement of the hyoid bone and larynx during normal swallowing. Seven adult patients (5 male, 2 female) with an age range of 46-82 years (mean = 63 years) participated. Criteria for inclusion were no history of cancer of or surgery to the head and neck (except tracheotomy), normal cognition, normal swallowing, and ability to tolerate decannulation. Digital videofluoroscopic swallowing studies were performed at 30 frames/s and with each patient seated upright in the lateral plane. Variables evaluated included maximum hyoid bone displacement and larynx-to-hyoid bone approximation under three randomized conditions: tracheotomy tube in and open with a 5-cc air-inflated cuff; tracheotomy tube in and capped with deflated cuff; and tracheotomy tube out (decannulated). Differences between maximum hyoid bone displacement and larynx-to-hyoid approximation (cm) based on presence/absence of a tracheotomy tube, tube cuff status, and tube capping status were analyzed with the Student's t test. Reliability testing with a Pearson product moment correlation was performed on 21% of the data. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found for both maximum hyoid bone displacement and larynx-to-hyoid bone approximation during normal swallowing based on tracheotomy tube presence, tube cuff status, or tube capping status. Intraobserver reliability for combined measurements of maximum hyoid displacement and larynx-to-hyoid approximation was r = 0.97 and interobserver reliability for the absence of aspiration was 100%. For the first time with objective data it was shown that the presence of a tracheotomy tube did not significantly alter two important components of normal pharyngeal swallow biomechanics, i.e., hyoid bone movement and laryngeal excursion. The hypothesis that a tracheotomy tube tethers the larynx thereby preventing hyoid bone and laryngeal movement during normal swallowing is not supported.",0,0
19521294,Lidocaine given intravenously improves conditions for laryngeal mask airway insertion during propofol target-controlled infusion,"Background and objective: Patient response to laryngeal mask airway insertion during propofol induction depends on many factors. Lidocaine has been used to reduce cardiovascular responses, coughing, and bucking induced by tracheal intubation. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of intravenous lidocaine on laryngeal mask airway insertion conditions during the induction of anaesthesia with propofol target-controlled infusion. Methods: Eighty patients, 16-54 years of age, weighing between 45 and 100 kg, who underwent minor surgery, were randomly divided into two groups (the lidocaine and control groups). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol target-controlled infusion at a target plasma concentration of 6 microg ml. The lidocaine group received 1.5 mg kg of lidocaine 50 s after starting target-controlled infusion and the control group received an equivalent volume of saline. Laryngeal mask airways were inserted when propofol effect-site concentrations reached 2.5 microg ml. Laryngeal mask airway insertion conditions (mouth opening, gagging, coughing, movements, laryngospasm, overall ease of insertion, and hiccups) were assessed, and haemodynamic responses were monitored for 3 min after laryngeal mask airway insertion. Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of haemodynamic responses. However, the lidocaine group showed lower incidences of coughing (5 vs. 22.5%), gagging (25 vs. 55%), and laryngospasm (2.5 vs. 17.5%) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Pretreatment with intravenous lidocaine 1.5 mg kg during induction with propofol target-controlled infusion improves laryngeal mask airway insertion conditions.",0,0

Methods: This research is an evaluation of a clinical diagnostic test in edentulous patients prior to operation. Five hundred eighty eight edentulous patients in a referral university hospital, between March 2008 and June 2011 scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. Those unable to open the mouth and those with pharyngo-laryngeal pathology were excluded. ULCT was assessed and compared with Cormack-Lehane grading as a gold standard for airway evaluation. Results: A high negative predictive value of 99.4% was a notable finding for the ULCT. The results also showed a high specificity (89.4%), high sensitivity (75.0%) and a high accuracy (89.3%) in a comparatively higher range for the ULCT. Conclusion: The ULCT proved to be a useful predictor for airway assessment in edentulous patients in this setting. Further studies are needed to reconfirm its validity in other ethnic groups.",1,1

17129986,Difficult intubation of a child through laryngeal mask airway with two tracheal tubes,"Difficult tracheal intubation occurs infrequently. It is estimated that difficult laryngoscopy occurs in 1-2% of patients. Tracheal intubation of especially small infants can be challenging. When faced with a difficult airway, intubation through a laryngeal mask airway is one method of obtaining a secure airway. Here, we report a 23-mo-old girl with chronic lung disease and severe pneumonia, who was admitted to our paediatric intensive care unit. Since the patient could not be intubated by the standard method, because her larynx was up and forward, she was intubated successfully with a laryngeal mask airway through which two consecutive tracheal tubes were inserted. Conclusion: Laryngeal mask airway has an important role as a back-up device in case direct visualization of the larynx is not possible.",0,0
20304398,Persistent snoring under conscious sedation during colonoscopy is a predictor of obstructive sleep apnea,"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by cessation of breathing during sleep. Conscious sedation (CS) induces sleep and may uncover sleep-related breathing disorders. Objective: To determine whether snoring during CS is a sensitive predictor of OSA. Design: Matched cohort study. Setting: University-based ambulatory endoscopy center. Patients: Consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy completed a detailed sleep questionnaire and physical examination geared toward detecting OSA (body mass index [BMI], neck circumference, and the presence of craniofacial abnormalities). The endoscopist was blinded to the information. Interventions: Portable nocturnal polysomnography. Main outcome measurements: Patients who snored during CS in the left lateral decubitus position for 10 seconds or longer were referred for polysomnography. Sex- and BMI-matched patients who did not snore served as control subjects. Results: A total of 131 patients were enrolled, and 24 (18.3%) of them snored. These patients (22 men, 2 women) had a predominance of Mallampati grade III/IV, higher Stanford and Epworth scale scores, and greater BMI and neck circumference and were more likely to report daytime sleepiness, decreased vigilance, and personality and mood changes (all P values <.05). All investigated patients who snored during CS had evidence of OSA versus 4 of 18 control subjects (mean apnea-hypopnea index: 40 events vs 5 events; P < .0001) (100% positive predictive value; 77.8% negative predictive value). Moderate or severe OSA was detected in 14 of 20 patients versus 1 of 18 control subjects (P < .001; 70% positive predictive value; 94.4% negative predictive value, 93% sensitivity, 74% specificity). Data obtained from sleep questionnaires and physical examination failed to accurately predict OSA. Limitations: Single-center nature and relatively small number of patients developing the outcome variable. Conclusions: Snoring during CS is a strong predictor of OSA. Given the medical and financial burden of undiagnosed OSA, these patients should be carefully identified and referred for sleep medication evaluation.",0,0
20179653,Airway scope versus macintosh laryngoscope in patients with simulated limitation of neck movements,"Background: Tracheal intubation in patients with suspected neck injuries should achieve two contradicting goals-sufficient laryngeal exposure and the least cervical spine movement. Because the former involves displacements of the cervical vertebrae, intubation under immobilization is widely performed today to prevent exacerbation of spinal code injuries. The unique curving blade of the Airway Scope (AWS) is designed to fit the oropharyngeal anatomy. A camera at the tip of the blade displays the view of the larynx, but unlike the direct laryngoscope, it needs no line-of-sight of the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axis. Our purpose is to determine whether AWS could be a suitable airway device for the intubation of patients with potential neck injury. Methods: Thirty-six patients scheduled for surgery were randomly assigned to undergo intubation using either AWS or Macintosh laryngoscope (MLS). After general anesthetic induction, the patient's head was set in a neutral position, and an appropriately sized semi-rigid neck collar was placed. Measurements include intubation time, number of attempts, success rate, Cormack-Lehane classification, airway optimization maneuver, Intubation Difficulty Scale scores, and complications. Results: Intubation time proved no statistical significance (mean ± SD, AWS, 62.9 seconds ± 26.0 seconds, MLS, 55.6 seconds ± 26.0 seconds; p = 0.42). AWS scored less in Cormack-Lehane classification (median [range], AWS I [I-I], MLS IIIa [I-IIIb]; p < 0.0001), required fewer additional airway optimization maneuvers (p = 0.0003), and scored less in Intubation Difficulty Scale scores (AWS 0 [0-1], MLS 2 [0-5]; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: In neck-immobilized patients using semi-rigid cervical collars, AWS improves laryngeal exposure and facilitates tracheal intubation. AWS may be a suitable intubation device for trauma patients.",0,0
12538218,A comparison of the upper lip bite test (a simple new technique) with modified Mallampati classification in predicting difficulty in endotracheal intubation: a prospective blinded study,"We explored the possibility that a simple and single test could replace the modified Mallampati score for either a difficult or an unaccomplished tracheal intubation in an impending hypoxic patient. Three hundred adult patients were enrolled in this study. They were subjected to the following assessments: 1) oropharyngeal class according to the modified Mallampati criteria; 2) the new, upper lip bite criteria-class I = lower incisors can bite the upper lip above the vermilion line, class II = lower incisors can bite the upper lip below the vermilion line, and class III = lower incisors cannot bite the upper lip; and 3) laryngeal view grading according to Cormack's criteria. The incidence of difficult intubation was 5.7%. The upper lip bite test showed significantly higher specificity and accuracy than the modified Mallampati test (P < 0.001). Comparisons of sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, between the two tests, however, did not reveal any significant differences (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the upper lip bite test is an acceptable option for predicting difficult intubation as a simple, single test.",1,1
25948906,Comparison of Macintosh laryngoscope and C-MAC video laryngoscope for intubation in lateral position,"Background and aims: Endotracheal intubation is conventionally performed when the patient is in supine position. It may be required to secure airway in laterally positioned patient. Tracheal intubation in lateral position seems to be difficult because the laryngeal view is compromised. Hence, C-MAC video laryngoscope (Karl Storz, Germany), a newer device using a modified macintosh blade may be useful for intubation in lateral position. Material and methods: A total of 100 American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I and II patients, randomly allotted to C-MAC or direct laryngoscopy group. Patients with difficult airway were excluded. After induction of anesthesia, patient was put in right-lateral position and intubation was carried out by consultant who is well-versed in using C-MAC laryngoscope. Time for intubation, number of attempts, Modified Cormack - Lehane grade, mucosal injury, and external laryngeal manipulation applied were noted. Statistical analysis: Demographics and baseline airway assessments were analyzed using summary statistics. Unpaired t-test was used to assess intubation time. Number of attempts, esophageal intubation, dental injury, mucosal injury, use of stylet, and application of external laryngeal manipulation were analyzed using Chi-square test. Results: Overall intubation success rate was 100%. The time taken in C-MAC group was 24.8 ± 8.5 s and in direct group was 33.8 ± 9.12 s. The number of intubation attempts was not significant. Cormack - Lehane grade was better with C-MAC laryngoscope. Mucosal injury and use of external laryngeal manipulation was more in direct group. Conclusion: C-MAC is better than Macintosh laryngoscope for intubation in lateral position.",0,0
7802175,The effect of laryngoscopy of different cervical spine immobilisation techniques,"Fifty patients underwent laryngoscopy with two different cervical spine immobilisation techniques. First the cervical spine was immobilised in a rigid collar with tape across the forehead and sandbags on either side of the neck, then with an assistant providing manual in-line immobilisation. Finally, patients underwent laryngoscopy in the routine intubating position. In 56% of patients the view of the larynx improved by one grade and in 10% the view improved by two grades when manual immobilisation was substituted for the collar, tape and sandbags (p < 0.0001). There was a poor view on laryngoscopy (grade 3 or 4) in 64% of patients when immobilised in a collar, tape and sandbags compared to 22% of patients undergoing in-line manual immobilisation (p < 0.001). Mouth opening was significantly reduced when patients were wearing cervical collars and this was the main factor contributing to the increased difficulty of laryngoscopy in this particular form of cervical spine immobilisation. It is recommended that manual in-line immobilisation should be the method of choice for cervical spine stabilisation during tracheal intubation.",0,0
26612286,Dexmedetomidine-midazolam versus Sufentanil-midazolam for Awake Fiberoptic Nasotracheal Intubation: A Randomized Double-blind Study,"Background: Awake fiberoptic intubation (AFOI) is usually performed in the management of the predicted difficult airway. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of dexmedetomidine with midazolam (DM) and sufentanil with midazolam (SM) for sedation for awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation. Methods: Fifty patients with limited mouth opening scheduled for AFOI were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 25 per group) by a computer-generated randomization schedule. All subjects received midazolam 0.02 mg/kg as premedication and airway topical anesthesia with a modified ""spray-as-you-go"" technique. Group DM received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25 μg·kg-1·h-1, whereas Group SM received sufentanil at a loading dose of 0.2 μg/kg over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 μg·kg-1·h-1. As necessary, since the end of the administration of the loading dose of the study drug, an additional dose of midazolam 0.5 mg at 2-min intervals was given to achieve a modified Observers' Assessment of Alertness/Sedation of 2-3. The quality of intubation conditions and adverse events were observed. Results: The scores of ease of the AFOI procedure, patient's reaction during AFOI, coughing severity, tolerance after intubation, recall of the procedure and discomfort during the procedure were comparable in both groups (z = 0.572, 0.664, 1.297, 0.467, 0.895, and 0.188, respectively, P > 0.05). Hypoxic episodes similarly occurred in the two groups, but the first partial pressure of end-tidal CO2after intubation was higher in Group SM than that in Group DM (45.2 ± 4.2 mmHg vs. 42.2 ± 4.3 mmHg, t = 2.495, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Both dexmedetomidine and sufentanil are effective as an adjuvant for AFOI under airway topical anesthesia combined with midazolam sedation, but respiratory depression is still a potential risk in the sufentanil regimen.",0,0

The relevant sonoanatomy and suitable probe placement are illustrated in relation to applicable regional anatomy (they are not discussed). The possible value of the use of ultrasonography to improve existing clinical practice in these areas is explored.",0,0
15966394,[Cricoarytenoid arthritis diagnosed after tracheostomy in a rheumatoid arthritis patient],"A 65-year-old woman was scheduled for total knee replacement. She had been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for 22 years. She also had a history of occasional acute dyspnea, which had been diagnosed as asthmatic bronchitis. Preoperative examinations of the airway revealed limited neck flexion, a small jaw, and normal mouth opening. After epidural catheterization, anesthesia was induced with propofol, and a #3 laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted. However, her lungs could not be ventilated through the LMA. Despite repeated attempts, proper placement of the LMA could not be achieved. Hence, a 7.0 mm ID armored endotracheal tube was inserted through an intubating LMA. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane in oxygen. The surgery proceeded uneventfully. Five minutes after extubation, inspiratory dyspnea occurred. The patient's trachea was re-intubated nasally with a bronchofiberscope. Since the bronchofiberscopy revealed remarkable laryngeal edema, percutaneous tracheostomy was performed. On the 3 rd postoperative day, cricoarytenoid arthritis that had caused occasional airway obstruction was diagnosed, although her laryngeal edema disappeared. She went home with a permanent tracheostomy. Although cricoarytenoid arthritis is a common occurrence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the diagnosis can be difficult. A scrupulous preoperative evaluation and awareness of cricoarytenoid arthritis are necessary for optimal anesthetic management.",0,0
25790130,Chronic cough in children,"Importance: Chronic cough is a common complaint among pediatric patients, but little information exists on the types of diagnoses in these patients and therapeutic outcomes. Objective: To characterize pediatric patients with chronic cough presenting to otolaryngology clinics, identify common causes and treatments, and evaluate therapeutic outcomes. Design, setting, and participants: In this retrospective analysis, all medical records for pediatric patients seen at 2 otolaryngology clinics at a single tertiary care academic medical center from January 2009 through June 2013 were searched for relevant diagnostic codes. Patients younger than 18 years presenting with chronic cough (cough of >4 weeks' duration) were selected for study; 58 patients met the inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. Interventions: Each patient was evaluated by the clinician via history, physical examination, and various tests and procedures, depending on the individual case, including flexible laryngoscopy, imaging tests, and/or airway evaluations. Each patient underwent treatment based on the working diagnosis. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes included final diagnosis, response to treatment (as indicated by resolution of cough after initial therapy), and diagnostic workup undergone. Results: Among the 58 included patients, the 3 most common diagnoses were related to infection (n = 23; 34%), airway hyperreactivity (n = 14; 24%), or gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 14; 24%). Initial response to treatment was observed in 83% of patients (n = 48), while the remaining 17% (n = 10) required further evaluation. All 10 patients for whom initial treatment failed (100%) had a diagnosis involving airway hyperreactivity (P < .001). In addition, chest radiography was more likely to be ordered (odds ratio [OR], 16.4; 95% CI, 1.91-140.8; P = .002) and to contain pertinent positive findings (OR, 12.8; 95% CI, 1.15-142.6; P = .04) in patients for whom treatment failed. Conclusions and relevance: Chronic cough in the pediatric otolaryngology setting differs from the typical presentation in the primary care setting. The top 3 causes encountered by the practicing otolaryngologist in a pediatric patient are infection, airway hyperreactivity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. If initial otolaryngologic treatment fails, chest radiography and early pulmonary consult are recommended.",0,0
23556410,SWIVIT--Swiss video-intubation trial evaluating video-laryngoscopes in a simulated difficult airway scenario: study protocol for a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial in Switzerland,"Background: Video-laryngoscopes are marketed for intubation in difficult airway management. They provide a better view of the larynx and may facilitate tracheal intubation, but there is no adequately powered study comparing different types of video-laryngoscopes in a difficult airway scenario or in a simulated difficult airway situation. Methods/design: The objective of this trial is to evaluate and to compare the clinical performance of three video-laryngoscopes with a guiding channel for intubation (Airtraq™, A. P. Advance™, King Vision™) and three video-laryngoscopes without an integrated tracheal tube guidance (C-MAC™, GlideScope™, McGrath™) in a simulated difficult airway situation in surgical patients. The working hypothesis is that each video-laryngoscope provides at least a 90% first intubation success rate (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval >0.9). It is a prospective, patient-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 720 patients who are scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, requiring tracheal intubation at one of the three participating hospitals. A difficult airway will be created using an extrication collar and taping the patients' head on the operating table to substantially reduce mouth opening and to minimize neck movement. Tracheal intubation will be performed with the help of one of the six devices according to randomization. Insertion success, time necessary for intubation, Cormack-Lehane grade and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score at laryngoscopy, optimization maneuvers required to aid tracheal intubation, adverse events and technical problems will be recorded. Primary outcome is intubation success at first attempt. Discussion: We will simulate the difficult airway and evaluate different video-laryngoscopes in this highly realistic and clinically challenging scenario, independently from manufacturers of the devices. Because of the sufficiently powered multicenter design this study will deliver important and cutting-edge results that will help clinicians decide which device to use for intubation of the expected and unexpected difficult airway.

25789568,Effects of the jaw-thrust manoeuvre in the semi-sitting position on securing a clear airway during fibreoptic intubation,"Securing a clear airway is important for successful fibreoptic intubation. We investigated whether the jaw-thrust manoeuvre in the 25° semi-sitting position improves airway clearance compared with the supine position in 88 anaesthetised patients randomly assigned to the two positions. After induction of anaesthesia, the fibreoptic bronchoscope was advanced into the mouth along the dorsum of the tongue during the jaw-thrust manoeuvre. Airway clearance was assessed at the level of the soft palate and epiglottis. Patients in the 25° semi-sitting position had clearer airways (judged subjectively by a three-level scale) than those in the supine position at the soft palate level (p = 0.012). At the level of the epiglottis, airway clearance was equally good in both positions. The mean (SD) times to view the vocal cord and carina were shorter in the 25° semi-sitting position (4 (1) s and 8 (1) s, respectively) compared with the supine position (6 (3) s and 11 (3) s; p < 0.001, respectively). The time to achieve intubation was also shorter in the 25° semi-sitting position (21 (5) s) than in the supine position (25 (7) s; p = 0.018).",0,0
25838762,Intra-Operative Airway Management in Patients with Maxillofacial Trauma having Reduction and Immobilization of Facial Fractures,"Background: Despite advancements in airway management, treatment of fractures in the maxillofacial region under general anesthesia remains a unique anesthetic challenge. We reviewed the pattern of airway management in patients with maxillofacial fractures and assessed those challenges associated with the different airway management techniques employed. Materials and methods: The anesthetic chart, theatre and maxillofacial operations records of patients who had reduction and immobilization of various maxillofacial fractures over a 2-year period were reviewed. Information obtained included the patient demographics, mechanisms of injury, types of fractures and details about airway management. Statistical Package for Social Sciences, SPSS version 17.0 was utilized for all data analysis. Results: Fifty-one patients were recruited during the 2-year study period. Mask ventilation was easy in 80-90% of the patients, 80% had Mallampati three or four, while 4 (7.8%) had laryngoscopy grading of 4. There was no statistically significant difference between the fracture groups in terms of the laryngoscopy grading (P = 0.153) but there was statistical significant difference in the technique of airway management (P = 0.0001). Nasal intubation following direct laryngoscopy was employed in 64.7% of the patients, fiber-optic guided nasal intubation was utilized in only 7.8%. None of the patients had tracheostomy either before or during operative management. Conclusion: Laryngoscopic grading and not adequacy of mouth opening predicted difficult intubation in this group of patients in the immediate preoperative period. Despite the distortions in the anatomy of the upper airway that may result from maxillofacial fractures, nasal intubation following direct laryngoscopy may be possible in many patients with maxillofacial fractures.",0,0
24201030,"Performance assessment in airway management training for nonanesthesiology trainees: an analysis of 4,282 airway procedures performed at a level-1 trauma center","Background: Although the use of an anesthesiology ""airway"" rotation to train the nonanesthesiologist is commonly employed, little data exist on the utility, clinical exposure, and outcomes of these programs. Methods: A prospectively collected observational dataset of airway procedures completed by trainees in a 4-week, anesthesiology-based, airway rotation at an academic, level-1 trauma center from July 2010 to September 2012 was reviewed. Prospectively defined data points were collected through an online data tool and included patient demographics, location, date, best laryngoscopic view, and attempt details. At the authors' institution, an attending trauma anesthesiologist is present for all intubation attempts. The primary outcome was first-attempt success. Results: A total of 4,282 self-reported, airway procedures were identified. The median number of procedures performed was 50.4 ± 13.2 (range, 20 to 93; 25th quartile = 41; 75th quartile = 57). Multivariate logistic regression analysis modeling of first-attempt success rate identified two independent predictors of success: rotation week (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.61; P < 0.0001) and number of previous intubation attempts before rotation (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.46; P = 0.02. In addition, the percentage of cases with a self-reported laryngoscopic grade 1 view increased significantly from 61 to 74% (P = 0.015) from week 1 to week 4 of the rotation. Conclusions: An anesthesiology-based program for airway training of nonanesthesiologists demonstrates improved self-reported, perceived first-attempt success over the course of training with improved ability to visualize glottic structures.",0,0
7486295,[Endotracheal intubation under propofol with or without vecuronium],"Objective: In order to test the hypothesis that under the association propofol-alfentanil-IV lidocaine the trachea could be intubated easily without an additional muscle relaxant, this study compared the intubation conditions when this association was combined or not with vecuronium. Study design: Randomized comparative trial. Patients: The study included 152 young adults classified as ASA physical class I and Mallampati presentation grade 1, randomly allocated either into Vecu+ group or Vécu0 group, depending on whether vecuronium was co-administered or not. Methods: All patients received midazolam 0.05 mg.kg-1 i.v., one minute before induction. Those of group Vecu0 were given successively within two minutes: alfentanil 0.03 mg.kg-1, lidocaine 1.5 mg.kg-1 i.v. and propofol 2.5 mg.kg-1. Patients of group Vecu+ received similar doses of alfentanil and propofol as well as vecuronium 0.08 mg.kg-1. The endotracheal tube was inserted one minute after induction in the patients of Vecu0 group, and after three minutes in those of the Vecu+ group. During intubation, scores of mouth opening, glottis opening and coughing were established, in order to assess intubation conditions. Results: Similar convenient intubating conditions were obtained in both groups (in 97% of patients in Vecu+ group vs 95% of those in Vecu0 group). In the latter, the glottis opening was less pronounced. Conclusions: In young healthy adults, without anaesthetic risk (emergency, full stomach) and without foreseen difficult intubation, the endotracheal tube can be inserted in convenient conditions without a muscle relaxant, under the association propofol-alfentanil-lidocaine iv.",0,0
27366367,Awake Fibreoptic Intubation for Forearm Injury in a Patient with Occipito-Cervical Fixator,"A 23-year-old male patient with occipitocervical fixator was scheduled for surgery due to injury to the right forearm. The patient's thyromental distance was 5 cm, mouth opening grade II, sternomental distance 10 cm and Mallampati score 4. Loss of extension and rotation movements of the head was assessed as difficult intubation criteria. Anaesthetic procedures are almost always difficult in patients with occipitocervical fixation; the limited cervical extension complicated both intubation and ventilation. In this report, application of general anaesthesia using awake fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation (FOB) is described. After routine monitoring of vital signs and premedication, hypopharyngeal topical anaesthesia was accomplished by instilling 10% lidocaine spray twice via the appropriate nostril. Superior laryngeal nerve block was performed with local anaesthetic infiltration of tissues 1 cm below the greater horns of the hyoid bone. Lingual and pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve were blocked. Transtracheal block was performed. Following completion of local anaesthesia, the patient was intubated using the awake FOB technique, on 5 L min(-1) of 100% O2. After muscle relaxation, the patient underwent a microsurgical operation to repair eight tendons, one artery, and one nerve. Surgery lasted for 5 hours. When the extubation criteria were met, the patient was extubated. In cases of occipitocervical fixation, which causes severe limitation of neck movements, the use of awake fibreoptic intubation should be considered.",0,0
23866402,"Helical CT scan with 2D and 3D reconstructions and virtual endoscopy versus conventional endoscopy in the assessment of airway disease in neonates, infants and children","Objectives: To study the use of helical computed tomography 2-D and 3-D images, and virtual endoscopy in the evaluation of airway disease in neonates, infants and children and its value in lesion detection, characterisation and extension. Methods: Conducted at Al-Noor Hospital, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, from January 1 to June 30, 2006, the study comprised of 40 patients with strider, having various causes of airway obstruction. They were examined by helical CT scan with 2-D and 3-D reconstructions and virtual endoscopy. The level and characterisation of lesions were carried out and results were compared with actual endoscopic findings. Conventional endoscopy was chosen as the gold standard, and the evaluation of endoscopy was done in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the procedure. For statistical purposes, SPSS version 10 was used. Results: All CT methods detected airway stenosis or obstruction. Accuracy was 98% (n=40) for virtual endoscopy, 96% (n=48) for 3-D external rendering, 90% (n=45) for multiplanar reconstructions and 86% (n=43) for axial images. Comparing the results of 3-D internal and external volume rendering images with conventional endoscopy for detection and grading of stenosis were closer than with 2-D minimum intensity multiplanar reconstruction and axial CT slices. Even high-grade stenosis could be evaluated with virtual endoscope through which conventional endoscope cannot be passed. A case of 4-year-old patient with tracheomalacia could not be diagnosed by helical CT scan and virtual bronchoscopy which was diagriosed on conventional endoscopy and needed CT scan in inspiration and expiration. Conclusion: Virtual endoscopy [VE] enabled better assessment of stenosis compared to the reading of 3-D external rendering, 2-D multiplanar reconstruction [MPR] or axial slices. It can replace conventional endoscopy in the assessment of airway disease without any additional risk.",0,0
15753632,Induced sputum versus bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the evaluation of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"Background: Induced sputum (IS) has been proposed as a useful noninvasive method for the assessment of airway diseases. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), an important tool for evaluating interstitial lung diseases, has limited utility due to its invasiveness and the difficulties of performing it in severely ill patients, while it is impractical for follow-up evaluation. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the differences and the possible correlation of cell differential and lymphocyte subpopulations between BALF and IS samples in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Methods: We studied prospectively 20 patients (18 male, 2 female) of median age 67 years (range 40-75) with IPF and 10 normal subjects (5 female, 5 male) of median age 59 years (range 36-70). IS was performed with hypertonic saline solution using an ultrasonic nebulizer (Ultraneb 2000). BALF was performed by a conventional procedure using fiberoptic bronchoscopy within 3 days from IS. May-Grunewald-Giemsa-stained preps were differentially counted and T-lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by a flow-activated cell sorter. Results: The percentage of macrophages was significantly lower in IS than in BALF (p < 0.0001), while the neutrophils were lower in BALF (p < 0.0001). A significant correlation was found between BALF and IS eosinophil counts (r = 0.54, p = 0.01) and CD4+/CD8+ ratio (r = 0.74, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our data suggest that different information is obtained by IS and BALF and thus, the two methods are complementary in IPF.",0,0
8595692,Laryngeal mask airway with mouth opening less than 20 mm,"We describe the use of a laryngeal mask airway in three adult patients whose mouth opening varied from 12 mm to 18 mm. The first patient's incisal opening was 12 mm. His airway was otherwise normal and the standard laryngeal mask was used as the definitive airway for the 90 min revision of facial scars and bone graft to mandible. The second patient, who had an incisal opening of 18 mm, was scheduled for posterior fossa craniotomy. She adamantly refused awake fibreoptic tracheal intubation. Following induction of general anaesthesia, a standard laryngeal mask was inserted and, through this, fibreoptic intubation was performed. The third patient, in addition to a mouth opening of only 18 mm, had limited neck movement from previous flap reconstruction following mandibulectomy, hemiglossectomy and radical neck dissection. For three more reconstructive head and neck procedures that ranged from 90 min to nine hours, the flexible reinforced laryngeal mask was inserted under topical anaesthesia and its correct position confirmed by fibreoptic laryngoscopy before induction of general anaesthesia. Maintenance of anaesthesia in all cases was uneventful and there were no postoperative complications.",0,0
24238105,The relationship between head and neck position and endotracheal tube intracuff pressure in the pediatric population,"Background: Over the past few years, there has been a change in clinical practice with a transition to the use of cuffed instead of uncuffed endotracheal tubes (ETTs) in pediatric patients. These changes have led to concerns regarding unsafe intracuff pressures in pediatric patients, which may result in postoperative morbidity. To avoid these issues, it is generally suggested that the intracuff pressure be maintained at ≤30 cmH2 O. The current study prospectively assesses the changes in intracuff pressure related to alterations in head and neck position in pediatric patients. Methods: Patients less than 18 years of age, undergoing surgery, requiring endotracheal intubation with a cuffed ETT were eligible for inclusion. No alteration in the technique of anesthetic induction or maintenance was required for the study. Following endotracheal intubation and inflation of the cuff with the head and neck in a neutral position, the intracuff pressure was measured. The intracuff pressure was then subsequently measured with the head turned to the right, head turned to the left, head and neck flexed, and head and neck extended. Results: A total of 200 patients were included in the study resulting in a total of 1000 intracuff pressure readings. When compared to the neutral position, the intracuff pressure increased in 545 instances (68.1%) with changes in position of the head and neck. An increase in intracuff pressure was noted more frequently and to the greatest degree with head and neck flexion. The pressure decreased in 153 instances (19.1%), most frequently with neck extension. Conclusion: Significant changes in the intracuff pressure occur with changes in head and neck position. In several cases, this resulted in a significant increase in the intracuff pressure. For prolonged cases with the head and neck turned from the neutral position, the intracuff pressure should be measured following patient positioning to ensure that the intracuff pressure is within the clinically recommended range.",0,0
1854057,[A rare cause of difficult intratracheal intubation: Langenbeck's disease],"A case of difficult tracheal intubation due to insufficient mouth opening once anaesthesia had been induced is described. At the pre-anaesthetic visit, the 47-year-old female patient had painless restricted mouth opening (two fingers' breadth), dental malpositions, and slight lateral mandibular deviation. Cervical spine movements were normal. She was ranked 3 on the Mallampati scale. The anaesthetic technique preserved spontaneous breathing (induction with propofol 1.5 mg.kg-1 and alfentanil 15 micrograms.kg-1). Manual ventilation was impossible. An oral cannula could not be inserted. As intubation by the normal route was impossible, the retromolar approach had to be used. Several attempts were required for successful intubation by this route. At the end of surgery, the patient was extubated without any difficulties. Postoperative investigations revealed hypertrophic coronoid processes. In this condition, the mandible is jammed by hitting the maxilla, especially when mandibular lifting manoeuvres are used to facilitate manual ventilation and tracheal intubation. Clinical and paraclinical predictors of difficult tracheal intubation seem to be unreliable in such dynamic abnormalities of mouth opening.",0,0
16288620,A randomised comparison of the Portex Softseal laryngeal mask airway with the LMA-Unique during anaesthesia,"We have compared the performance of the single use laryngeal airway devices Softseal and LMA-Unique in a randomised comparative trial in anaesthetised healthy patients who did not receive neuromuscular blockade. Primary outcome was success of airway placement. Secondary outcomes included manipulations and complications during use, ease of insertion, airway and fibreoptic assessment of airway positioning, and complications postoperatively. We planned to study 300 patients but interim analysis demonstrated the study should be stopped after 100 patients. During insertion the Softseal required more attempts for successful insertion (p = 0.041), more manipulations (p < 0.0001) and caused more complications (p = 0.048). Failure of placement occurred in five cases with the Softseal and none with the LMA-Unique (p = n/s). Two Softseal needed to be removed during maintenance because of airway obstruction, giving an overall failure rate of seven (p = 0.013). Serial tests of positioning favoured the LMA-Unique (p = 0.012). Ventilation was more successful in the LMA-Unique group but the difference was not significant (p = 0.051). Seal pressure was higher with the Softseal (26.5 vs. 20.5 cmH(2)O, p = 0.005). Fibreoptic view via the devices was not statistically significantly different. During maintenance of anaesthesia more complications arose with the Softseal (p = 0.03). Anaesthetist ratings of ease of insertion and overall usefulness favoured the LMA-Unique (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.024, respectively). After anaesthesia, sore throat occurred more frequently and was more severe in those patients anaesthetised with a Softseal both in recovery (p = 0.015) and at 24 h (p = 0.012). We conclude that the Softseal performs less well and causes more complications than the LMA-Unique.",0,0
9476105,[Difficult intubation in otorhinolaryngologic laser surgery. Is there a predictive parameter?],"In the planning of laser surgery for ENT operations, the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems. Intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes. The aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ENT-related laser surgery. In a prospective study, 91 patients were included and the Mallampati-score modified by Samsoon and Young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation. The results showed a significant correlation (p < 0.05, Chi-Square test). However, the specificity was only 72% and the sensitivity of 60% was too low to be of practical use. The results were independent of the endotracheal tube used. Although use of the laser for ENT operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist, there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use. This problem is demonstrated in a literature review.",1,1
20806858,[The impact of nasal obstruction on OSAHS],"Objective: To evaluate the impact of nasal obstruction on OSAHS. Method: One hundred and twenty cases of OSAHS with or without nasal obstruction were analyzed by Hypno PTT(PTT)and Mallampati score (MS); Acoustic rhinometry was measured in all 120 cases. Result: A significant correlation was found between the MS and the AHI measured during the sleep (r = 0.266, P < 0.01). The relative risk of OSAHS with a MS of III or IV in the whole group was 1.96, and 2.46 in cases with nasal obstruction. Conclusion: A high MS represents a predisposing factor for OSAHS, especially in which associated with nasal obstruction.",0,0
16858984,The Thai Anesthesia Incidents Study (THAI Study) of difficult intubation: a qualitative analysis,"Objectives: To examine the causes, outcomes and contributing factors including suggested corrective strategies associated with difficult intubation. Material and method: Difficult intubation and failed intubation incidents were extracted from the Thai Anesthesia Incidents Study (THAI Study) database conducted between February 1, 2003 to January 31, 2004 and analyzed by using descriptive statistics Results: Two hundred and thirty-four cases of difficult intubation were recorded. Among those, 50 cases (21%) were failed intubation. The most common cause (95%) of incidents was due to patients difficult anatomy. Prediction of events was derived from physical examination (65%) and history taking (50%). Majority of incidents (44%) occurred in Mallampati II and III. Only 3 cases (1.3%) of morbid obesed and 3 cases (1.3%) of pregnant patients were attributed to the events. Most incidents (119 cases, 50.9%) were successfully managed by conventional techniques. The adverse effects included hypoxemia (54 cases, 23.1%), esophageal/ tracheal injury (40 cases, 17.1%) and prolonged ventilatory support (17 cases, 7.3%). One patient died from sepsis. The reported contributing factors included inadequate experience, lack of knowledge including inadequate preoperative evaluation and preparation. Additional training, quality assurance and protocol/algorithm tended to minimize the incidents. Conclusion: The majority of difficult intubation could be predicted. Proper preoperative evaluation and equipment preparation, appropriate technique including experienced anesthesia personnel could attenuate the morbidity and mortality.",0,0
14616599,Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients by ultrasound quantification of anterior neck soft tissue,"In 50 morbidly obese patients, we quantified the soft tissue of the neck from the skin to the anterior aspect of the trachea at the vocal cords using ultrasound. Thyromental distance, mouth opening, limited neck mobility, modified Mallampati score, abnormal upper teeth, neck circumference and sleep apnoea were assessed as predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. Of the nine (18%) cases of difficult laryngoscopy, seven (78%) had a history of obstructive sleep apnoea, compared with two of the 41 patients (5%) in whom laryngoscopy was easy (p < 0.001). Patients in whom laryngoscopy was difficult had more pretracheal soft tissue (mean (SD) 28 (2.7) mm vs. 17.5 (1.8) mm; p < 0.001) and a greater neck circumference (50 (3.8) vs. 43.5 (2.2) cm; p < 0.001). None of the other predictors correlated with difficult laryngoscopy. We conclude that an abundance of pretracheal soft tissue at the level of the vocal cords is a good predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in obese patients.",1,1
9075035,Positive pressure ventilation with the size 5 laryngeal mask,"Study objective: To obtain data about the safety and efficacy of the size 5 laryngeal mask airway (LMA), which is a scaled-up version of the size 4 and is generally recommended for patients over 90 kg, for positive pressure ventilation (PPV), ease of insertion, oropharyngeal and gastric insufflation pressures, fiberoptic positioning, and complication rates. Design: Prospective survey. Setting: Teaching hospital. Patients: 179 patients undergoing PPV with the size 5 LMA. Interventions: The clinical criteria for using the size 5 LMA and the PPV technique were weight above 90 kg or an inadequate seal with a size 4 LMA and surgery estimated to last longer than 45 minutes. Anesthesia was standardized and included fentanyl/propofol for induction, N2O/O2/isoflurane 0.5% to 2% for maintenance, and atracurium for muscle relaxation. Two 20-second attempts were allowed with the standard recommended technique, followed by a single attempt with the Guedel technique. The LMA cuff was then inflated and the airway pressure at which either oropharyngeal leak or gastric insufflation occurred was determined by closure of the expiratory valve and anterior neck followed by epigastric auscultation. Measurements and main results: The age and weight range were 15 to 82 years and 46 to 153 kg, respectively. 29% of patients had a body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg/m2. On 31 occasions the size 5 was used following an inadequate seal with the size 4. The weight range of this subgroup was 46 to 87 kg. The device was placed within 20 seconds in 94% and there were no failed placements within three attempts. Gastric insufflation was detected before oropharyngeal leak in 17% and oropharyngeal leak was detected first in 73%. In 10% of patients there was no leak at an inspiratory pressure of 45 cm H2O. Mean (range) for gastric insufflation pressure was 31 (range 23-45) cm H2O. Mean (range) for oropharyngeal leak was 33 (range 8-44) cm H2O. The mean (range) airway pressure was 17 (range 13-26) at tidal volumes of 10 ml/kg. At this tidal volume, 97.2% of patients could be ventilated without gastric insufflation and 98.3% without an oropharyngeal leak. At tidal volumes of 8 ml/kg no patient had gastric insufflation and 0.7% had an oropharyngeal leak. Oropharyngeal leak pressure of less than 15 cm H2O occurred in 11 patients. There was no correlation between fiberoptic score or Mallampati score and either gastric insufflation or oropharyngeal leak. The incidence of problems was 3% and the oxygen saturation remained above 94%. There was no correlation between problems, leak pressures, and BMI. Conclusions: Positive pressure ventilation with the size 5 LMA is safe and effective with a low failure/problem rate using tidal volumes of 8 to 10 ml/kg, even in those patients who are moderately obese. The device is suitable for patients weighing under 90 kg in whom the seal with the size 4 is inadequate.",0,0

15374552,Factors influencing time of intubation with a lightwand device in patients without known airway abnormality,"Study objective: To evaluate the correlation between accepted screening tests for difficult tracheal intubation and ease of intubation with a lightwand blind technique. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Anesthetic rooms of a university hospital. Patients: 122 female, ASA physical status I, II, and III patients requiring tracheal intubation for elective surgery. Interventions: After receiving a standardized anesthetic induction, patients first underwent direct laryngoscopy to determine Cormack laryngoscopy grade, then tracheal intubation was performed using a transillumination method. Measurements and main results: Patient demographics, Mallampati class (MC), mouth opening (MO; cm), and thyromental distance (TMD; cm) were all measured and the values recorded. Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated for each patient. Laryngoscopy grades obtained by laryngoscopy were also recorded. Times to intubation were measured by a chronometer and failures were recorded. Patients were then allocated to groups according to the measured parameters: BMI > or = 30 kg/m2, BMI < 30 kg/m2; TMD > or = 6 cm, TMD < 6 cm; MO > or = 3, MO < 3; MC I, MC II, MC III, MC IV, and Laryngoscopy Grade (LG) 1, LG 2, LG 3, LG 4. Intubation times at the first attempt were compared within the groups for each variable. The total results of 119 patients were studied; overall success was 99%, and mean time to intubation at the first attempt was 9.2 +/- 4.9 seconds. Although time to intubation was prolonged with increasing Mallampati and laryngoscopy scores, and in the TMD < 6 cm and BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 groups, only the MC III and BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 groups represented a statistically significant difference of prolongation. Mean time to intubation in the MC III and BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 groups were 13.2 +/- 5.4 (p = 0.011) and 14.8 +/- 1.7 (p < or = 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: Mallampati class III airway significantly increases time to intubation when the transillumination technique is used. BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 is another factor that interferes with the ease and success of intubation with this technique.",0,0

7867116,The use of an endotracheal ventilation catheter for jet ventilation during a difficult intubation,"This case report describes the use of an endotracheal ventilation catheter (ETVC) to provide prolonged intraoperative jet ventilation, reintubation and the maintenance of tracheal access following extubation. It emphasizes that excellent oxygenation and ventilation can be achieved but such management can be complicated by a pneumothorax even when the risks are minimized. A 43-yr-old man presented for possible pulmonary sleeve resection. Placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) by direct laryngoscopy was unsuccessful due to the inability to visualize the glottis. A 7.5 mm endotracheal tube (ETT) was successfully introduced over a fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB). An ETVC was passed, permitting manually cycled jet ventilation while general intravenous anaesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained. The ETT was then withdrawn over the ETVC and jet ventilation continued for approximately 90 min, while attempts at placing a DLT over a now malfunctioning FOB continued. These attempts were eventually abandoned and the patient was returned to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) haemodynamically stable. The trachea was extubated over the ETVC, which remained in situ. A pneumothorax was noted on the postoperative chest x-ray. This case illustrates prolonged intraoperative jet injection via a ""jet stylet"" with satisfactory ventilation and oxygenation but complicated by a pneumothorax. Also it illustrates a strategy for the management of a ""difficult extubation.""",0,0

18301906,Does tonsillectomy reduce the risk of being a habitual or severe snorer?,"We assessed the relationship between tonsillectomy and being a habitual or severe snorer. Volunteers were asked to provide their age and sex, a detailed snoring history covering the frequency and intensity of snoring, and their smoking and alcohol intake habits. After oral and nasal examinations, the tonsil size scores, Mallampati index scores, and nasal obstructions of the volunteers were recorded. Body heights and weights were measured, and body mass indexes were calculated. Being male, aging, an increase in body mass index and tonsillectomy were identified as independent risk factors for being a habitual and severe snorer. Although a nasal obstruction was found to be an independent risk factor for being a habitual snorer, an obstructive tongue base was identified as an independent risk factor for being a severe snorer. Tonsillectomy reduces the risk of being both a habitual and severe snorer. This reduced incidence and intensity of snoring following tonsillectomy could be accepted as a long-term beneficial side effect of the operation.",0,0
25437701,[Correlation between oro and hypopharynx shape and position with endotracheal intubation difficulty],"Background and objective: Prediction of intubation difficulty can save patients from major preoperative morbidity or mortality. The purpose of this paper is to assess the correlation between oro-hypo pharynx position, neck size, and length with endotracheal intubation difficulty. The study also explored the diagnostic value of Friedman Staging System in prediction cases with difficult intubation. Method: The consecutive 500 ASA (I, II) adult patients undergoing elective surgery were evaluated for oro and hypopharynx shape and position by modified Mallampati, Cormack and Lehane score as well as Friedman obstructive sleep apnea classification systems. Neck circumference and length were also measured. All cases were intubated by a single anesthesiologist who was uninformed of the above evaluation and graded intubation difficulty in visual analog score. Correlation between these findings and difficulty of intubation was assessed. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive and Negative Predictive Values were also reported. Results: Cormack-Lehane grade had the strongest correlation with difficulty of intubation followed by Friedman palate position. Friedman palate position was the most sensitive and had higher positive and negative predictive values than modified Mallampati classification. Cormack-Lehane grade was found to be the most specific with the highest negative predictive value among the four studied classifications. Conclusion: Friedman palate position is a more useful, valuable and sensitive test compared to the modified Mallampati screening test for pre-anesthetic prediction of difficult intubation where its involvement in Multivariate model may raise the accuracy and diagnostic value of preoperative assessment of difficult airway.",0,0
24072551,Tracheal intubation in patients with odentogenous abscesses and reduced mouth opening,"Background: Odentogenous abscesses with involvement of the facial or cervical spaces can be life-threatening and often have to be drained under general anaesthesia. Trismus and swelling can make intubation with a Macintosh laryngoscope difficult or even impossible. However, indirect laryngoscopy has been successful when conventional direct laryngoscopy has failed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of the Glidescope laryngoscope in patients with odentogenous abscesses and the improvement in mouth opening after neuromuscular block. Methods: After approval of the ethics committee, 100 patients with odentogenous abscesses were randomized to undergo tracheal intubation with the Glidescope or Macintosh laryngoscope. Success rate, visualization of the glottis, intubation duration, and need for supporting manoeuvres were evaluated. Results: Intubation with the Glidescope was always successful, while conventional intubation failed in 17 out of 50 patients (P<0.0001). In all patients in whom conventional tracheal intubation failed, a subsequent attempt with the Glidescope was successful. The view at the glottis (according to Cormack and Lehane; P<0.0001), intubation duration [34 s (CI 27-41) vs 67 s (CI 52-82), mean (95% confidence interval); P=0.0001], and need for supporting manoeuvres (P<0.0001) were significantly different. The inter-incisor distance improved overall with induction of anaesthesia from 2.0 cm (CI 1.8-2.2) to 2.6 cm (CI 2.3-2.9; P<0.0001) and was correlated with the duration of symptoms. Conclusions: In patients with odentogenous abscesses, the use of a Glidescope laryngoscope was associated with significantly faster tracheal intubation, with a better view, fewer supporting manoeuvres, and a higher success rate than with a conventional laryngoscope. Improvement of the inter-incisor distance after induction of anaesthesia correlated with the duration of symptoms.",0,0
9135184,The effects of single-handed and bimanual cricoid pressure on the view at laryngoscopy,"The effects of two different methods of cricoid pressure on laryngoscopic view were studied in 94 healthy women presenting for routine gynaecological surgery. Laryngoscopy was performed with either single-handed or bimanual cricoid pressure; after grading of the view obtained, the other method was used and second grading performed. Laryngoscopic view was better with the bimanual than with the single-handed technique (p = 0.016). In 21 cases, a better laryngoscopic view was obtained with the bimanual technique; in eight cases it was better with the single-handed technique; and in 65 cases, the method of cricoid pressure made no difference. Age, weight, Mallampatti score and thyromental distance did not differ between patients in these three groups. Bimanual cricoid pressure should be the initial technique of choice during rapid sequence induction but, in a minority of cases, switching to a single-handed technique may improve the laryngoscopic view. The technique of cricoid pressure which produces the best laryngoscopic view in an individual patient cannot be predicted from the physical features studied.",0,0
25042696,"Mallampati class, obesity, and a novel airway trajectory measurement to predict difficult laryngoscopy","Objectives/hypothesis: To determine whether Mallampati class correlates with Cormack-Lehane grade in obese adults, and investigate a novel airway trajectory measurement (ATM) to anticipate difficult laryngoscopy. Study design: Retrospective cohort plus a pilot study. Methods: One hundred eighty-four nonobese and 160 obese adults underwent laryngoscopy. Spearman correlations, gamma coefficients (G), and Kendall's τ investigated body mass index (BMI):Mallampati, BMI: Cormack-Lehane, and Mallampati:Cormack-Lehane. A z test compared the two groups. Twenty-six volunteers had neck x-rays taken in the sniffing position to examine trajectories to the larynges (ATM). Results: Positive predictive value of high Mallampati for difficult laryngoscopy was 8.57%. BMI did not correlate with Mallampati (r = 0.055 [nonobese], r = -0.056 [obese]) or Cormack-Lehane [r = -0.014 [nonobese], r = -0.022 [obese]). Among nonobese adults, gamma coefficients for BMI:Mallampati was 0.039 (P = .63), for BMI:Cormack-Lehane was 0.02 (P = .85), and for Mallampati:Cormack-Lehane was 0.43 (P = .004). Among obese adults, gamma coefficients for BMI:Mallampati was -0.127 (P = .16), for BMI:Cormack-Lehane was 0.014 (P = .88), and for Mallampati:Cormack-Lehane was 0.365 (P = .01). Kendall's τ were comparable to gamma coefficients in all analyses. When comparing gamma coefficients for Mallampati:Cormack-Lehane among the nonobese and obese, z = 0.04 (P = .98). In the ATM study, only Mallampati and upper lip bite test had a significant relationship (G = 1.00, P < .001). Conclusions: Mallampati correlates poorly with Cormack-Lehane, regardless of BMI. Pilot data suggest that ATM is feasible.",1,1
19068733,[Usefulness of cephalometry and pharyngeal findings in the primary diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome],"We studied the usefulness of cephalometry and pharyngeal findings in determining efficient primary diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Subjects were 171 adult men with sleep-disordered breathing, who underwent cephalometry and polysomnography (PSG) and had pharyngeal findings evaluated by modified Mallampati grade (MMP) and palatine tonsil size. An apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > or = 15 in PSG was considered to indicate OSAS. We analyzed the correlation between AHI and other parameters and conducted stepwise multiple regression analysis to predict AHI, and studied the screening performance of prediction equations using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Of the 8 cephalometric parameters examined, the length of the soft palate (PNS-P; p = 0.011) and the distance from the mandibular plane to the hyoid bone (MP-H; p < 0.001) correlated significantly with AHI. Two indices of the pharyngeal finding and body mass index (BMI) also significantly correlated with the AHI (MMP; p < 0.001, tonsil size; p = 0.005, BMI; p < 0.001). We next set up three prediction equations including (a) two significant cephalometric parameters (PNS-P and MP-H), (b) two pharyngeal indices (MMP and tonsil size), or (c) both. BMI was included in all three. ROC curve analysis showed that the screening performance of prediction equations was (c) > (a) > (b). Sensitivity and of equation (c) with a cutoff of 15 were 0.95 and specificity 0.25. These results indicate that both cephalometric parameters and pharyngeal indices should be included in conducting an efficient primary diagnosis for OSAS.",0,0
19225059,Obstructive sleep apnea in children: relative contributions of body mass index and adenotonsillar hypertrophy,"Background: The obesity epidemic has prompted remarkable changes in the proportion of obese children who are referred for habitual snoring. However, the contribution of obesity to adenotonsillar hypertrophy remains undefined. Methods: In our study, 206 nonobese habitually snoring children with polysomnographically diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) to 206 obese children. Size estimates of tonsils and adenoids, and Mallampati class scores were obtained, and allowed for the assessment of potential relationships between anatomic factors and obesity in pediatric OSA. Results: The mean OAHI for the two groups was approximately 10.0 episodes/h total sleep time. There was a modest association between adenotonsillar size and OAHI in nonobese children (r = 0.22; p < 0.001) but not in obese children. The mean (+/- SEM) adenotonsillar size was larger in nonobese children (3.85 +/- 0.16 vs 3.01 +/- 0.14, respectively; p < 0.0001), and conversely Mallampati class scores were significantly higher in obese children (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The magnitude of adenotonsillar hypertrophy required for any given magnitude of OAHI is more likely to be smaller in obese children compared to nonobese children. Increased Mallampati scores in obese children suggest that soft-tissue changes and potentially fat deposition in the upper airway may play a significant role in the global differences in tonsillar and adenoidal size among obese and nonobese children with OSA.",0,0
23210069,Predicting efficiency of post-induction mask ventilation based on demographic and anatomical factors,"Background: Failure to ventilate patients by mask leads to serious complications especially if associated with difficult intubation. Previous studies have used subjective and indirect measures to evaluate difficulty in mask ventilation, which are associated with high inter-observer discrepancies. In this study, we have defined and used efficiency of mask ventilation (EMV) as an objective and direct surrogate for ease of mask ventilation in patients undergoing GA and mask ventilation using neuromuscular relaxation. Materials and methods: 1050 adult patients prospectively were evaluated with respect to different patients demographic and physical factors and EMV. EMV was defined as the ratio of minute ventilation via anesthesia mask to that via tracheal tube expressed as percentage. Edentolous patients were ventilated using lip-over-mask techniques. Separate analyses were done for edentolous and non-edentolous patients. Results: EMV in edentolous patients (n=269) using the lip-over-mask method was relatively high (90.9 ± 14.3%, 60.14-128.57 range). The result of multiple regression analysis in patients with normal denture determined receded chin, presence of beard, male gender, high Mallampati classes, high neck circumference, low inter-incisors gap, and old age as independent factors for estimating EMV. A regression formula for predicting EMV was developed which had an acceptable R-square value with a good model fit. Conclusions: Using EMV is an easy and reliable tool for measuring efficiency of mask ventilation. Based on the result of this study, EMV can be estimated from patient's demographic and physical factors. In edentolous patients, using the lip-over-mask method results in adequate ventilation of lungs.",0,0
16292955,Macro-optical color assessment of the pulmonary airways with subsequent three-dimensional multidetector-x-ray-computed-tomography assisted display,"Bronchial diseases alter the color and structural characteristics of the pulmonary mucosa through changes in blood flow, epithelial thickening, and abnormal cell growth. Current analysis of these subtle changes includes visual interpretation of the airway color and topography through bronchoscopy procedures, and quantitative multidetector-x-ray-computed-tomography (MDCT)-based structural analysis, each affording valuable insights to the health of the lungs. The fusion of the bronchoscopy and MDCT image data promises to provide a synergistic data set exhibiting both mucosal color and topography crucial to fostering an understanding of airway structure and function. A real-time airway color analysis imaging system is developed and utilized to perform pulmonary mucosal color assessment in healthy volunteers with subsequent comparative studies performed in example disease states. Our results indicate that macro-optical digital bronchoscopes with appropriate image analysis may have a significant impact on understanding bronchial diseases. To ensure the correct interpretation of scene content, which is critical in the assessment of airway topography, we are developing methods of extracting 3-D structure from 2-D bronchoscope images utilizing MDCT imaging techniques. The resulting 3-D true-color images of the pulmonary mucosa facilitate the combination of mucosal color and topography analysis as well as region of interest localization within the airway tree.",0,0
16483382,Bronchoscopic assessment of airway retention time of aerosolized xylitol,"Background: Human airway surface liquid (ASL) has abundant antimicrobial peptides whose potency increases as the salt concentration decreases. Xylitol is a 5-carbon sugar that has the ability to lower ASL salt concentration, potentially enhancing innate immunity. Xylitol was detected for 8 hours in the ASL after application in airway epithelium in vitro. We tested the airway retention time of aerosolized iso-osmotic xylitol in healthy volunteers. Methods: After a screening spirometry, volunteers received 10 ml of nebulized 5% xylitol. Bronchoscopy was done at 20 minutes (n = 6), 90 minutes (n = 6), and 3 hours (n = 5) after nebulization and ASL was collected using microsampling probes, followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Xylitol concentration was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and corrected for dilution using urea concentration. Results: All subjects tolerated nebulization and bronchoscopy well. Mean ASL volume recovered from the probes was 49 +/- 23 microl. The mean ASL xylitol concentration at 20, 90, and 180 minutes was 1.6 +/- 1.9 microg/microl, 0.6 +/- 0.6 microg/microl, and 0.1 +/- 0.1 microg/microl, respectively. Corresponding BAL concentration corrected for dilution was consistently lower at all time points. The terminal half-life of aerosolized xylitol obtained by the probes was 45 minutes with a mean residence time of 65 minutes in ASL. Corresponding BAL values were 36 and 50 minutes, respectively. Conclusion: After a single dose nebulization, xylitol was detected in ASL for 3 hours, which was shorter than our in vitro measurement. The microsampling probe performed superior to BAL when sampling bronchial ASL.",0,0
19151285,Diagnostic predictor of difficult laryngoscopy: the hyomental distance ratio,"Background: We evaluated the usefulness of the hyomental distance (HMD) ratio (HMDR), defined as the ratio of the HMD at the extreme of head extension to that in the neutral position, in predicting difficult visualization of the larynx (DVL) in apparently normal patients, by examining the following preoperative airway predictors, alone and in combination: the modified Mallampati test, HMD in the neutral position, HMD and thyromental distance at the extreme of head extension and HMDR. Methods: Preoperatively, we assessed the five airway predictors in 213 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. A single experienced anesthesiologist, blinded to the results of the airway evaluation, performed all of the direct laryngoscopies and graded the views using the modified Cormack and Lehane scale. DVL was defined as a Grade 3 or 4 view. The optimal cutoff points for each test were determined at the maximal point of the area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristic curve. For the modified Mallampati test, Class >or=3 was predefined as a predictor of DVL. Results: The larynx was difficult to visualize in 26 (12.2%) patients. In univariate analyses, the HMD and thyromental distance at the extreme of head extension and the HMDR were significantly related to DVL. The HMDR with the optimal cutoff point of 1.2 had greater diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve of 0.782), than other single predictors (P < 0.05), and it alone showed a greater diagnostic validity profile (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 60%) than any test combinations.

For the present case series, we report the use of video laryngoscopy to evaluate the airway of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, as a means to reduce the risk of immediate postextubation stridor by assessing the degree of laryngeal edema. We also describe the use of cellular phone cameras to document and communicate airway edema in using video laryngoscopy for the patients' medical records. We found video laryngoscopy to be an effective method of assessing airway edema, and cellular phone cameras were useful for recording and documenting video laryngoscopy images for patients' medical records.",0,0
16360522,The association of tongue scalloping with obstructive sleep apnea and related sleep pathology,"Objective: The association between OSAS and patient history and physical exam findings is previously established; however, to our knowledge there are no studies that evaluate the role of tongue scalloping as a reliable clinical indicator for OSA, snoring, or the presence of other sleep pathology as evidenced by polysomnography. This study evaluates the hypothesis that such an association exists. Subjects and methods: Sixty-one otolaryngology clinic patients were evaluated by history and physical exam for the presence and degree of tongue scalloping, snoring, and other previously established clinical indicators for sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive apnea. Twenty-five of the 61 study patients were additionally evaluated by overnight polysomnography to provide conclusive diagnosis of sleep pathology. The degree of tongue scalloping was graded from 0 to 3 and its significance as a screening, diagnostic, and predictive factor for sleep pathology was then statistically determined. Results: Twenty-seven patients (44%) had known or newly documented OSA and 47 (77%) had a history of snoring. Twenty-seven patients (44%) had some degree of tongue scalloping (1-3) and 74% of these patients were male. The presence of any degree of tongue scalloping (grade 1-3) in patients with known or newly documented OSA showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 52%, 68%, 70%, and 50% respectively. The presence of tongue scalloping in patients with either known snoring history or newly documented snoring showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 47%, 64%, 81%, and 26% respectively. Presence of tongue scalloping was 71% specific for abnormal sleep efficiency (<85%), 70% specific for abnormal AHI (>5), and 86% specific for nocturnal desaturation >4% below baseline. Presence of tongue scalloping also showed PPV of 67% for abnormal AHI, 89% for apnea or hypopnea, and 89% for nocturnal desaturation. Presence and severity of tongue scalloping showed positive correlation with increasing Mallampati and modified Mallampati airway classification. Conclusions: In high-risk patients we found tongue scalloping to be predictive of sleep pathology. Tongue scalloping was also associated with pathologic polysomnography data and abnormal Mallampati grades. We feel the finding of tongue scalloping is a useful clinical indicator of sleep pathology and that its presence should prompt the physician to inquire about snoring history.",0,0
21334505,Reevaluation of the airways of obese patients undergone bariatric surgery after reduction in body mass index,"Background and objectives: Difficulty intubating is a cause of mortality in anesthesiology and it can be related to obesity. The diagnosis of difficult intubation contributes for successful airways management. However, parameters that predict difficult airways are not well established. Mallampati classification, the interincisor gap, neck circumference, thyromental distance, and the presence of obstructive sleep apnea, are parameters that can indicate difficult intubation. Surgical treatment of obesity provides reduction in body mass index (BMI) with stabilization after about 2 years. The objective of the present study was to reevaluate the parameters described above and compare them with pre-surgical values. Methods: The BMI, Mallampati classification, neck circumference, interincisor gap, thyromental distance, and the degree of obstructive sleep apnea in polysomnography were evaluated in 51 patients of both genders in the preoperative period. Two years after the surgery and reduction of the BMI to < 35 kg.m(-2), predictor factors of difficult airways were reevaluated by another anesthesiologist who knew the patients' BMI before surgery. Nine patients were excluded. The new reevaluation was performed, and for those who did not have another polysomnography the somnolence scale of Epiworth was applied. Results: Forty-two patients were reevaluated. They showed a reduction in BMI and neck circumference, and an increase in both interincisor gap and thyromental distance. Only one patient showed a reduction in Mallampati scale, and only 4 patients performed polysomnography. Conclusions: Reduction of the BMI allows for an increased interincisor gap, thyromental distance, and reduction in neck circumference. Mallampati classification remains the same.",0,0
9229156,Sedation and anesthesia for pediatric bronchoscopy,"Bronchoscopic examination may be indicated to evaluate various parts of the airway including the larynx, the subglottic region, or the more peripheral aspects of the tracheobronchial tree. The chances of a successful examination may be increased by the appropriate use of sedation. The following article reviews the steps required prior to during, and after the provision of anesthesia for bronchoscopic examination of the airway. The essentials of the preoperative examination, requirements for intraoperative monitoring, and postoperative recovery are discussed. The various agents and techniques available for deep sedation and general anesthesia are reviewed.",0,0
19302646,Evaluation of tracheal tube introducers in simulated difficult intubation,"In a randomised cross-over study, 72 anaesthetists attempted to place Pro-Breathe, new Portex, and Frova single-use tracheal tube introducers and an Eschmann multiple-use introducer in the trachea of a manikin set to simulate a grade 3 laryngeal view. Successful placement (proportion, 95% confidence interval) of either the Frova (78%, 67-86%) or the Eschmann introducer (64%, 52-74%) was significantly more likely (p < 0.0001) than with the Pro-Breathe (4%, 1-12%) or the new Portex introducer (13%, 7-22%). The difference between the success rates for the Frova and the Eschmann introducers (p = 0.08) was not significant. A separate experiment revealed that the peak force that could be exerted by the Pro-Breathe, new Portex and Frova single-use introducers were three to six times greater than that which could be exerted by the Eschmann introducer (p < 0.0001). The single-use introducers are more likely to cause tissue trauma during placement, particularly if held close to the tip.",0,0
22550378,Sedation and analgesia in the performance of interventional procedures,"Interventional procedures can produce pain, anxiety, and physical and mental distress. Analgesia and sedation in the interventional radiology suite are given routinely during interventional procedures and allow a safe, comfortable, and technically successful procedure to be performed. Appropriate sedation decreases patient movement, patient anxiety, pain perception, and is crucial to successfully perform percutaneous interventions. A thorough understanding of the preoperative patient assessment, intraprocedural monitoring, pharmacologic characteristics of medications, postoperative care, and treatment of complications is required for the practicing interventionalist. Complications related to sedation and analgesia can occur secondary to preexisting medical conditions, incorrect drug administration, and/or inadequate patient monitoring.1,2.",0,0
21870301,Feasibility and safety of propofol sedation in flexible bronchoscopy,"Background: Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic with a rapid onset of action. There are only limited data evaluating propofol for flexible bronchoscopy. We analysed the feasibility and safety of propofol for bronchoscopy in a high output tertiary care centre. Methods: Prospective data on patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, were analysed. Patient demographics, ASA class, Mallampati class, indication for bronchoscopy, bronchoscopic procedures, duration of examination, medication requirements, minor and major adverse events, haemodynamic parameters, as well as cough scores during the procedure were documented. Patients were followed up to discharge from the bronchoscopy suite. Results: Data from 440 patients with a mean age 60 years (±15.5, 260 male) were analysed. The main indication for bronchoscopy was a suspicion of malignancy. The most common diagnostic procedures were bronchoalveolar lavage in 253 cases (31.5%) and bronchial washing in 174 cases (21.7%). The mean duration of the procedure was 19.6 min (±12.08). The mean propofol dose was 200 mg (±107.5) corresponding to 2.89 mg/kg (±1.70). Minor adverse events included oxygen desaturation in 72 (16.4%), hypotension in 68 (15.4%) and minor bleeding in 11 (2.5%) patients. No major adverse events were recorded. The median decline in systolic blood pressure after initiation of sedation was 14 mm Hg (3-28). A drop in systolic blood pressure greater than 20 mm Hg was observed in 166 of the 440 patients (37%). Conclusion: Propofol sedation for flexible bronchoscopy is feasible and safe.",0,0
9709137,The best view at laryngoscopy using the McCoy laryngoscope with and without cricoid pressure,"The best view obtained by levering the tip of the McCoy laryngoscope blade with or without modified cricoid pressure was studied in 100 patients presenting for general surgery. The airway was assessed pre-operatively (Mallampati score, thyromental distance, mouth opening, protrusion of the jaw and weight) in an attempt to identify the patients who might benefit from the use of the McCoy laryngoscope. The vocal cords were visible at laryngoscopy with the blade in the neutral position in 32 cases. In the 68 remaining patients the vocal cords were partly visible in 48. The epiglottis only was seen in 18 patients and in two not even the epiglottis could be visualised. Elevation of the blade or modified cricoid pressure improved the view in 38/68 cases and 57/68 cases, respectively (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank). Using our method of pre-operative assessment we were unable to identify those patients who might benefit from either manipulation.",0,0
24807474,Endovenous laser ablation under general anesthesia for day surgery: feasibility and outcomes of the 300 patients,"Purpose: Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) for superficial venous insufficiency is traditionally performed under tumescent local anesthesia as day case surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of general anesthesia in addition to tumescent anesthesia in patients undergoing EVLA. Methods: The anesthesia and clinical registration records of 341 extremities of 300 adult patients were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. Demographic and clinical data, preoperative anesthetic evaluation data (ASA physical status, preoperative airway assessment, Mallampati score), type of supraglottic device, duration of anesthesia and surgery, any surgical and/or anesthetic complication, timing of mobilization and discharge, and postoperative course were evaluated. Results: Mean duration of operation and anesthesia was 28 (12-55) and 40 (20-65) minutes, respectively. Mobilization and discharge timing was 25 (11-45) and 139 (110-200) minutes, respectively. All patients were discharged the same day of surgery. Conclusion: The combination technique of administering general anesthesia with supraglottic device and tumescent anesthesia is a safe and effective method to reduce the patients' pain and discomfort during the EVLT procedure within the scope of day case surgery.",0,0
8836277,Use of the Univent System tube for difficult intubation and for achieving one-lung anaesthesia,"Background: One-lung ventilation in major thoracic surgery is the most commonly accepted technique, not only for surgery on the lung but also in procedures involving the oesophagus, mediastinum and thoracic aorta. Conventional double-lumen tubes may sometimes be difficult to place correctly in patients in whom intubation is difficult. In such cases, the Univent System tube may be of help. It has a curved movable blocker of small calibre, and is designed to slide inside the bronchial tree and occlude all or part of the target lung. Case report: We describe a new application of the Univent System tube in three cases where intubation was presumed to be difficult, and in another with unexpected difficult intubation. The laryngeal approach was carried out with the distally displaced blocker, inserting it through the sub-epiglottis or the posterior commissure visible orifice. The tube was firmly held and slid through the length of the blocker, rotating slowly until fully introduced. The advantages and criteria for its use are discussed. Conclusion: Although the double-lumen tube is the first choice for one-lung ventilation, the Univent tube is a good option for selective bronchial intubation and in patients in whom difficult intubation is predicted.",0,0
21749908,Difficult prehospital endotracheal intubation - predisposing factors in a physician based EMS,"Objectives: For experienced personnel endotracheal intubation (ETI) is the gold standard to secure the airway in prehospital emergency medicine. Nevertheless, substantial procedural difficulties have been reported with a significant potential to compromise patients' outcomes. Systematic evaluation of ETI in paramedic operated emergency medical systems (EMS) and in a mixed physician/anaesthetic nurse EMS showed divergent results. In our study we systematically assessed factors associated with difficult ETI in an EMS exclusively operating with physicians. Methods: Over a 1-year period we prospectively collected data on the specific conditions of all ETIs of two physician staffed EMS vehicles. Difficult ETI was defined by more than 3 attempts or a difficult visualisation of the larynx (Cormack and Lehane grade 3, or worse). For each patient ETI conditions, biophysical characteristics and factors of the surrounding scene were assessed. Additionally, physicians were asked whether they had expected difficult ETI in advance. Results: Out of 3979 treated patients 305 (7.7%) received ETI. For 276 patients complete data sets were available. The incidence of difficult ETI was 13.0%. In 4 cases (1.4%) ETI was impossible, but no patient was unable to be ventilated sufficiently. Predicting conditions for difficult intubation were limited surrounding space on scene (p<0.01), short neck (p<0.01), obesity (p<0.01), face and neck injuries (p<0.01), mouth opening<3 cm (p<0.01) and known ankylosing spondylitis (p<0.01). ETI on the floor or with C-spine immobilisation in situ were of no significant influence. The incidence of unexpected difficult ETI was 5.0%. Conclusions: In a physician staffed EMS difficult prehospital ETI occurred in 13% of cases. Predisposing factors were limited surrounding space on scene and certain biophysical conditions of the patient (short neck, obesity, face and neck injuries, and anatomical restrictions). Unexpected difficult ETI occurred in 5% of the cases.",1,1
16002965,Sputum induction and bronchoscopy for assessment of ozone-induced airway inflammation in asthma,"Background: Neutrophilic airway inflammation, as defined by cell counts in respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), is a key end point in many studies of respiratory toxicity in both healthy and asthmatic subjects. BAL and sputum induction (SI) are the most common methods of sampling RTLF in such studies. However, the comparability of these methods (BAL and SI) after experimental treatment has not been investigated in a head-to-head controlled trial. Methods: To determine whether BAL and SI are comparable and can be used in place of each other in the assessment of neutrophilic airway inflammation after ozone (O(3)) exposure, we exposed 13 asthmatic subjects to either 0.2 ppm of O(3) or filtered air (FA) followed by either BAL or SI. Subjects then underwent the alternate (O(3) or FA) exposure followed by the same method of RTLF sampling. Next, subjects repeated the same exposure protocol with the alternate method of RTLF sampling. Differences in inflammatory indexes including the percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (%PMNs) between the exposures were then correlated by regression analysis. Results: The %PMNs in sputum was poorly correlated with that in BAL fluid (R = 0.12). The correlation between the %PMNs in sputum and in the bronchial fraction of BAL (BFx) fluid, however, was somewhat higher (R = 0.50). Furthermore, the uncertainty of the estimate of %PMN values in BFx fluid and BAL fluid based on those of sputum values, using regression models, was almost as great as the magnitude of the O(3) effect itself (ie, 9.7% and 5.5% estimate errors for O(3) effects of 17.0% and 7.5%, respectively). Conclusion: We concluded that SI and BAL indexes are not directly interchangeable in the assessment of O(3)-induced airway inflammation in asthmatic subjects.",0,0
23157089,[Use of the air-Q intubating laryngeal airway for tracheal intubation in predicted difficult airway management in a pediatric patient],"The intubating laryngeal airway, air-Q ILA, was recently introduced in Japan. It has been used in adult patients for difficult airway management; however, there are few reports available on its use in pediatric patients. We report the use of the air-Q ILA in predicted difficult airway management in a 16-month-old patient with Apert syndrome characterized by acrocephalosyndactyly undergoing a syndactyly operation. It was somewhat difficult to keep his airway with a facemask, and an air-Q ILA was inserted. Following the ventilation via air-Q ILA, tracheal intubation guided by a tracheal fiberscope was attempted through the air-Q ILA. Five months after this operation, the patient again underwent the same operation. We managed his airway in the same way as previously, and the tracheal was intubated. This case shows that the air-Q ILA can be an alternative device in pediatric difficult airway management.",0,0
19282760,Adult epiglottitis: 6 years experience in a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong,"Adult epiglottitis is a relatively rare but potentially lethal disease. It seems to be increasing in incidence in other countries. The objective of this study was to examine the common presentations and clinical course of adult epiglottitis in Hong Kong. Retrospective review of 80 consecutive cases of adult epiglottitis admitted between 2000 and 2005. A rising trend in the incidence of adult epiglottitis was observed. The mean age (SD) was 49 years (15.7) and the male-to-female ratio was 2.5:1. Disease presentation was nonspecific and sore throat was the most common symptom. All patients were admitted to hospital; 47 (59%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 31 (39%) had provision of an artificial airway. Mean (SD) length of stay in ICU and hospital was 1.9 (2.2) and 6.3 (2.9) days, respectively. Six patients (7.5%) were complicated by epiglottic abscess formation. No deaths occurred in this series. Patients who required airway intervention had a higher ICU admission rate and a higher bacterial identification rate. Flexible laryngoscopy was more sensitive than lateral neck radiography in diagnosing epiglottitis (100 vs. 81.4%). The laryngoscopic finding of a narrowed airway was strongly related to the requirement for airway intervention (odds ratio=23.7, 95% confidence interval=4.2-132.6, P<0.001). A high index of suspicion is required for making the diagnosis of adult epiglottitis. Proper airway assessment and close monitoring are of the utmost importance in patient management. Flexible laryngoscopy is the key investigation of choice in the emergency department.",0,0
21342390,Does surgical decompression in Ludwig's angina decrease hospital length of stay?,"Introduction: Ludwig's angina (LA) is an uncommon and potentially life-threatening condition of the upper aero-digestive tract that often requires the coordinated efforts of the surgical, anesthetic and intensive care teams to optimize management. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the documented clinical features and the surgical and airway management of LA at Alice Springs Hospital for the purpose of assessing surgical outcomes with particular reference to length of stay (LOS). Methods: Retrospective chart review from January 1998 to January 2008 examined patients admitted with LA at Alice Springs Hospital. Documented clinical features, interventions, and operative findings including floor of mouth swelling, Mallampati score, and airway compromise were collected. Outcomes, with particular respect to LOS, for those who received intravenous (IV) or inhalational induction and those that received awake fibre-optic intubations were compared. Results: Of 30 patients with LA, 28 (93%) were managed with operative drainage with a LOS in the intensive care unit (ICU) of 2 days and a hospital LOS of 5 days. Seven received awake fibre-optic intubation and 21 had IV or inhalational anesthesia with none requiring tracheotomy. There was no statistical difference in LOS between those patients whose microbiological culture results showed no growth and those whose cultures had positive growth. Discussion: Management was generally operative decompression with IV antibiotics. LOS is not affected by the presence or absence of culture positive infection. It is proposed that operative intervention is safe, effective, and is associated with shorter patient stays in the intensive care unit and the hospital overall.",0,0
7788196,[Clinical experience of laryngeal mask airway in lateral position during anesthesia],"Background: The laryngeal mask airway (LMA), inserted blindly into hypopharynx in patients in supine position, has been reported to be successful in the management of the airway and can provide adequate ventilation during anesthesia. In our study, we used LMA to maintain airway during anesthesia in patients in lateral position. Methods: Eighty surgical patients, ASA class I-II, undergoing hemorrhoidectomy, were placed in lateral surgical position before induction. The induction agents were propofol (2 mg/kg), fentanyl (2 micrograms/kg) and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). When mouth opening can be done passively, a LMA was inserted into the mouth and advanced blindly over the tongue into the pharynx until resistance was felt. The rim was immediately inflated with air and several manual positive pressure ventilatory breaths were given to the patient to check for leaks in the LMA system. Chest movement was observed and bilateral lung ausculation was performed to confirm the adequacy of ventilation. Once the LMA was in place, enflurane with oxygen was administered until operation was completed. During the anesthetic course, EKG, blood pressure, pulse oximeter, end-tidal CO2 and inspiratory pressure were monitored. Results: Blind insertion of LMA in lateral position was successful in the first attempt in 70% (56/80) of patients. Twenty (18/80) patients required a second or third trial making the total successful rate of LMA insertion as high as 90% (74/80). In four patients, airway control through LMA was unsatisfactory due to large air leakage during manual ventilation. In two patients the LMA could not be inserted in proper position for maintaining airway. In six cases, the LMA was immediately removed and was substituted by face-mask for anesthesia. Two patients complained of postoperative sore throat. No other specific complications such as cough, laryngospasm and aspiration was noted. Conclusion: We demonstrated that LMA can be easily inserted and can provide effective patency of airway during anesthesia even in lateral position. It can be used as a substitute for face-mask in anesthesia in this position to prevent complications such as pressure injury that a face-mask may cause.",0,0
24498770,[Case of pharyngeal laceration associated with the use of airwayscope in a patient with difficult airway],"A 54-year-old woman with atlantoaxial subluxation in rheumatoid arthritis was scheduled for total elbow arthroplasty. Since her neck was stabilized with a cervical collar and her interincisor distance was 1.5 finger-breadth, a difficult airway was anticipated. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl. Mask ventilation was barely achieved with difficulty Then insertion of an Intlock with Airwayscope (AWS) into the pharynx was attempted but could not be performed because of restriction of neck mobility and small mouth opening. Although only Intlock separated from AWS could be inserted into the pharynx, oropharyngeal bleeding occurred and we could not obtain an appropriate view on the monitor. Following aspiration of blood, the trachea was intubated using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope under AWS guidance. After the operation, a view of bronchoscopy by an otolaryngologist revealed three lacerations from the mucosa to muscle layer in the pharynx. The lacerations could have resulted from use of AWS in a patient with a small mouth opening and with vulnerable mucosa due to long-term steroid therapy.",0,0
15106031,Exhaled markers of inflammatory lung diseases: ready for routine monitoring?,"Assessing airway inflammation is important for investigating the underlying mechanisms of many lung diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Yet these are not measured directly in routine clinical practice because of the difficulties in monitoring inflammation. The presence and type of airway inflammation can be difficult to detect clinically, and may result in delays in initiating appropriate therapy. Non-invasive monitoring may assist in differential diagnosis of lung diseases, assessment of their severity and response to treatment. There is increasing evidence that breath analysis may have an important place in the diagnosis and clinical management of asthma, COPD, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and other major lung disease. The article reviews whether current noninvasive measurements of exhaled gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), hydrocarbons, inflammatory markers exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are ready for routine use in clinical practice.",0,0
19512881,Crossover comparison of the laryngeal mask supreme and the i-gel in simulated difficult airway scenario in anesthetized patients,"Background: The single-use supraglottic airway devices LMA-Supreme (LMA-S; Laryngeal Mask Company, Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom) and i-gel (Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, Berkshire, United Kingdom) have a second tube for gastric tube insertion. Only the LMA-S has an inflatable cuff. They have the same clinical indications and might be useful for difficult airway management. This prospective, crossover, randomized controlled trial was performed in a simulated difficult airway scenario using an extrication collar limiting mouth opening and neck movement. Methods: Sixty patients were included. Both devices were placed in random order in each patient. Primary outcome was overall success rate. Other measurements were time to successful ventilation, airway leak pressure, fiberoptic glottic view, and adverse events. Results: Success rate for the LMA-S was 95% versus 93% for the i-gel (P = 1.000). LMA-S needed shorter insertion time (34 +/- 12 s vs. 42 +/- 23 s, P = 0.024). Tidal volumes and airway leak pressure were similar (LMA-S 26 +/- 8 cm H20; i-gel 27 +/- 9 cm H20; P = 0.441). Fiberoptic view through the i-gel showed less epiglottic downfolding. Overall agreement in insertion outcome was 54 (successes) and 1 (failure) or 55 (92%) of 60 patients. The difference in success rate was 1.7% (95% CI -11.3% to 7.6%). Conclusions: Both airway devices had similar insertion success and clinical performance in the simulated difficult airway situation. The authors found less epiglottic downfolding and better fiberoptic view but longer insertion time with the i-gel. Our study shows that both devices are feasible for emergency airway management in patients with reduced neck movement and limited mouth opening.",0,0
22174461,Ultrasound of the airway,"Currently, the role of ultrasound (US) in anaesthesia-related airway assessment and procedural interventions is encouraging, though it is still ill defined. US can visualise anatomical structures in the supraglottic, glottic and subglottic regions. The floor of the mouth can be visualised by both transcutaneous view of the neck and also by transoral or sublinguial views. However, imaging the epiglottis can be challenging as it is suspended in air. US may detect signs suggestive of difficult intubation, but the data are limited. Other possible applications in airway management include confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement, prediction of post-extubation stridor, evaluation of soft tissue masses in the neck prior to intubation, assessment of subglottic diameter for determination of paediatric endotracheal tube size and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. With development of better probes, high-resolution imaging, real-time picture and clinical experience, US has become the potential first-line noninvasive airway assessment tool in anaesthesia and intensive care practice.",0,0
2648082,Airway obstruction after autologous reimplantation of the porcine lobe,"Bronchiolitis obliterans (irreversible small airway obstruction) is a late complication of heart-lung transplantation. Chronic immune rejection is believed to be the major cause of this complication. Our hypothesis was that denervation might contribute to airway obstruction. To test this hypothesis in the absence of immune rejection, we performed a lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung and autologous reimplantation of the lower lobe of the left lung in 13 growing pigs. To serve as age-matched controls, six other pigs had sham left thoracotomy and nine others had a lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung alone. Nine to 10 weeks after operation, the animals were anesthetized and the lungs mechanically ventilated. The lobes were then isolated in vivo to measure differential transrespiratory mechanics and volumes. Dynamic compliance was significantly lower in the reimplanted lobe than it was in the contralateral right lung. This was the case after lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung or sham thoracotomy. Dynamic resistance was significantly higher in the reimplanted lobe than it was in the contralateral right lung and in the left lung after sham thoracotomy. Measurements of extravascular lung water, dry lobe weight, alveolar cross-sectional area, and volumetric proportions of lung parenchyma and alveolar spaces did not demonstrate abnormal structural growth after reimplantation. We conclude that lobectomy of the upper lobe of the left lung and autologous reimplantation of the left lower lobe leads to adverse changes in flow-dependent measurements of airway patency. Changes in bronchomotor regulation imposed by denervation may contribute to airway obstruction after heart-lung transplantation.",0,0
16000669,Football equipment design affects face mask removal efficiency,"Background: Researchers have investigated the performance of face mask removal tools for spine injury management in football but not the effects of football equipment design. Hypotheses: Various styles or designs of football helmet equipment (helmets, face masks, loop straps) affect face mask removal efficiency. A cordless screwdriver performs more efficiently than do cutting tools. Study design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Nineteen certified athletic trainers were randomly assigned to group 1 (cordless screwdriver and the FM Extractor) or group 2 (cordless screwdriver and the Trainer's Angel). Subjects randomly performed face mask removal for 6 conditions composed of helmet (3), face mask (3), and loop strap (5) combinations. Time, head movement, perceived difficulty, and success rates were measured. Results: Multiple significant differences were found in time, movement, and perceived difficulty between the 6 helmet equipment conditions. The Shockblocker loop strap was consistently superior in all variables regardless of the tool used or the helmet it was attached to. The cordless screwdriver created less movement (mean range from any one plane, 2.8 degrees -13.3 degrees ), was faster (mean range, 42.1-68.8 seconds), and was less difficult (mean rating of perceived exertion range, 1.4-2.9) compared to cutting tools (ranges, 4.4 degrees -18.4 degrees in any one plane, 71-174 seconds, rating of perceived exertion, 2.8-7.7). Trial failure was more common with cutting tools than with the screwdriver. Conclusion: Differences in football helmet equipment affect face mask removal. The cordless screwdriver is more efficient than the FM Extractor and Trainer's Angel. Clinical relevance: Professionals responsible for the care of football athletes must be knowledgeable in the types of equipment used and the best option available for effective airway access.",0,0
24047290,Dental injury after conventional direct laryngoscopy: a prospective observational study,"This observational study assessed the frequency and risk factors of dental damage after classic direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in 536 adult patients. The patients' sex, age, height, weight, dental condition, dental mobility, Mallampati class, interincisor gap, thyromental distance, neck circumference, and head and neck extension were recorded. From anaesthesia records, the difficulty of intubation, the number of attempts, type of neuromuscular blocking agent used and duration of anaesthesia were recorded. After anaesthesia, examination revealed that 134 patients (25.0%) had dental damage affecting 162 teeth (147 maxillary; 15 mandibular). Enamel fracture was the commonest injury. In tooth number 21, the interincisor gap (OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.0-5.9)) and in tooth number 22, the number of intubation attempts (OR 5.3 (95% CI 1.3-22.0)) were considered a risk factor for dental injury. Conventional direct laryngoscopy is associated with a strikingly high incidence of dental damage, although specific risk factors remain unclear.",0,0
9895091,Fiberoptic-guided airway exchange of the esophageal-tracheal Combitube in spontaneously breathing versus mechanically ventilated patients,"The aim of this study was to compare fiberoptic-guided airway exchange of the esophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC, Kendall-Sheridan Catheter Corp., Argyle, NY) with an endotracheal tube in spontaneously breathing versus mechanically ventilated patients. Forty patients with Mallampati score III and IV scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated into two groups (n = 20 each): nonparalyzed, spontaneously breathing or paralyzed, mechanically ventilated patients. After anesthetic induction and insertion of the ETC, a fiberoptic bronchoscope threaded into an armored endotracheal tube was passed transnasally into the larynx. Endotracheal intubation was successful in 18 spontaneously breathing patients and in 15 patients during controlled ventilation. Successful airway exchange was completed in significantly less time (P < 0.05) in spontaneously breathing patients (9+/-3 min; mean +/- SD) than in mechanically ventilated patients (13+/-4 min). Both methods allowed for continuous airway control and maintenance of ventilation and oxygenation. The described method is a means of replacing the ETC with an endotracheal tube without interruption of airway control or ventilation. Replacing the ETC with an endotracheal tube using this method is more readily accomplished during spontaneous ventilation than during controlled ventilation. Implications: We describe the replacement of the Combitube by an endotracheal tube by the aid of fiberoptic bronchoscopy and without interruption of airway control or ventilation. The performance of this technique was facilitated by spontaneous ventilation compared with mechanical ventilation.",0,0
19502026,Predicting difficult airways using the intubation difficulty scale: a study comparing obese and non-obese patients,"Study objective: To compare intubation difficulty in obese and non-obese patients by intubation difficulty scale (IDS), intubation duration measurement, and oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) levels. Design: Prospective, controlled study. Setting: Operating room of a tertiary-care hospital. Patients: 204 ASA physical status I, II, and III adult patients who underwent elective surgery with endotracheal intubation. Interventions and measurements: Preoperative airway parameters, intubation duration, IDS scores, and lowest SaO(2) during intubation were recorded. Main results: IDS scores were higher in the obese group than the non-obese (2.29 +/- 0.45 and 1.26 +/- 0.2, respectively, P = 0.03). Intubation duration was 45.1 +/- 6 sec for obese versus 36.8 +/- 2.6 sec for the non-obese group (P = 0.20). The lowest SaO(2) recorded was 97%, with no difference noted between groups. Mallampati class >or=3 was found to positively predict intubation difficulty scores greater than 5. Conclusions: Difficult intubation was more prevalent among obese than non-obese patients, but intubation duration and lowest SaO(2) levels during intubation were not. Moreover, the modified Mallampati test was found to be a moderately good (60%) predictor of difficult intubation among obese patients.",0,0
11771604,A new technique for difficult intubations,"A Macintosh laryngoscope was modified to allow a rigid fibreoptic scope to be attached. Our purpose was to determine if Cormack and Lehane scores could be improved using the described fibreoptic technique, thus allowing easier intubating conditions. In order to assess its value for intubation, a study was performed on 53 patients. Thirty-three of these patients were classified to be difficult intubations (suspected or unanticipated). The Cormack and Lehane scores were improved by the use of the modified laryngoscope by one to three grades compared to the standard laryngoscopy. Significantly improved intubating condition were observed. The assessment demonstrates that many patients with Mallampati scores of III and IV can be successfully managed by this technique.",0,0
11903936,Difficult tracheal intubation induced by maxillary distraction devices in craniosynostosis syndromes,"Background: Difficult intubation occurred during anaesthesia for removal of maxillary distraction devices in five of seven children with syndromal craniosynostoses (four with Apert, two with Pfeiffer and one with Crouzon syndrome). Methods: Intubation was assessed in terms of laryngeal view and an established intubation difficulty score and had been straightforward before device insertion. Difficulty was induced by trismus due to device insertion and by increased maxillary prominence. This was compounded by preexisting mandibular hypoplasia. Cephalometric analysis, with each child acting as their own control, demonstrated anterior displacement of the maxilla and increased maxillary vertical height, as well as increased protuberance of the maxillary incisors. Results: All five difficult tracheal intubations were associated with preoperative Mallampati scores of 3 or 4 and the nine straightforward intubations with scores of 1 or 2. Maximal interincisor distance was less than the lower 95% confidence limit for age in all five children who were difficult to intubate at the time of device removal. No child had a failed intubation, but all had significantly increased intubation difficulty. Conclusions: In view of the risks of trauma, hypoxia and aspiration associated with difficult direct laryngoscopy, we recommend elective fibreoptic intubation at anaesthesia for removal of maxillary distraction osteogenesis devices in these children.",0,0
9771172,Awake intubation of the difficult airway with the intubating laryngeal mask airway,"The intubating laryngeal mask airway is a new device that facilitates intubation of the trachea. We assessed its use in 15 awake patients in whom we anticipated difficulty with tracheal intubation; we would otherwise have secured the patients' airways using a fibreoptic bronchoscope. All patients were sedated and had their airways anaesthetised with local anaesthetic. The tracheas of all 15 patients were successfully intubated. The mean time from start of sedation to successful intubation was 10.8 min. The mean time from completion of sedation and airway local anaesthesia to tracheal intubation was 2.8 min. Patients remained haemodynamically stable throughout, peripheral oxygen saturation was maintained and there were no obvious cases of pulmonary aspiration. Most patients complained of sore throat and hoarseness. We have demonstrated through this descriptive study that the intubating laryngel mask airway may, in certain circumstances, be used as an alternative to the fibreoptic bronchoscope.",0,0

3684366,CT digital radiography: alternative technique for airway evaluation in physically disabled patients,"Evaluation of the airway for the presence of granulation tissue prior to removal of a tracheostomy is essential to prevent sudden respiratory decompensation secondary to obstruction. Airway examination in a brain and/or spinal cord injured patient is especially difficult under fluoroscopy. The patient's lack of mobility results in poor visualization of the trachea, secondary to the overlying dense osseous components of the shoulders and thoracic cage. A CT localization view (digital view), which allows manipulation and magnification of the digital data in order to see the hidden airway and detect associated obstructing lesions, is proffered as an alternative technique to high KV, magnification technique. Thirteen examinations were performed satisfactorily in eleven patients examined by this technique with little expenditure of time, physical exertion, and irradiation. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of digital airway examination were 100%, 67% and 92% respectively with bronchoscopy used as the standard.",0,0
24411533,Endotracheal intubation in patients with unstable cervical spine using LMA-Fastrach and gum elastic bogie,"Objective: To evaluate the success of alternative technique of ET- intubation in patients with unstable cervical spine with Philadelphia collar around the neck. Study design: Case series. Place and duration of study: The Department of Anaesthesia, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from June 2009 to June 2012. Methodology: Adult patients of either gender with unstable cervical spine wearing Philadelphia collar electively scheduled for cervical spine decompression and fixation more than one level were included. Those with anticipated difficult intubation, mouth opening < 25 mm and BMI > 27 kg/m2 were excluded. After induction of anaesthesia FT-LMA was inserted. Correct position of FT-LMA was confirmed then soft straight end of gum elastic bogie was passed through FTLMA into trachea. FT-ILMA was removed on bogie. Reinforced silicon ET- tube was rail road on bogie. The bogie was pulled out and position of ET- tube was confirmed with ETCO2, chest movement and auscultation on bag ventilation. The ease of insertion of FT-LMA, ET- intubation and maximum time taken for successful intubation was noted. Results: 26 patients were studied with mean age of 59.3 ± 2.93 years and M: F ratio of 7:3. The mean time taken from the insertion of gum elastic bogie to the ET intubation was 38.9 ± 1.20 seconds. The success rate of ET- intubation in the first attempt was 88.4% and 7.6% in two attempts. Intubation failed in one patient. The mean ease of insertion of FT-LMA and ET- intubation in all patients was 46.7 ± 2.59 and 46.5 ± 2.66 respectively on VAS ( 0-100). No complication was noted in any patient. Conclusion: This technique is safe and reliable for achieving adequate ventilation and intubation in patients with unstable cervical spine with Philadelphia collar in place.",0,0
17591297,A comparison of preoperative airway assessment techniques: the modified Mallampati and the upper lip bite test,"The purpose of this study was to compare the preoperative anesthetic airway evaluation methods of the modified Mallamapti test (MMT) and upper lip bite test (ULBT) with the direct laryngoscopic views obtained during tracheal intubation. Positive relationships were predicted for the MMT and ULBT with direct laryngoscopic view and between the MMT and ULBT. We assessed 50 patients' airways preoperatively by MMT and ULBT. Intraoperatively, laryngoscopic views were graded on the Cormack and Lehane scale. Descriptive statistics and correlations were computed. There was no relationship between the MMT and the ULBT and the Cormack and Lehane scale. There was a significant relationship between the ULBT and the Cormack and Lehane scale (r = 0.512; P <.001 ). The ULBT was superior to the MMT in every measure in this study: sensitivity (55% vs 11%), specificity (97% vs 75%), positive predictive value (83% vs 9%), and accuracy (90% vs 64%). The findings of this study support those of a previous study of the ULBT. Because of the ease of the ULBT and the promising results of this small study, we recommend further research with a larger, more diverse sample.",0,0
9195348,Lightwand intubation of infants and children,"Study objective: To examine factors contributing to successful lightwand (lighted stylet) intubation of infants and children. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: 125 children under age 10 years presenting for elective surgery. Interventions: Prototype lightwands specifically designed for pediatric patients were used. Intubations were done by anesthesia residents with little or no prior lightwand experience. All attempts were recorded on videotape. In a subgroup of 14 patients, an endoscopic view of the lightwand was also recorded with a flexible nasopharyngoscope. Measurements and main results: 125 patients with a mean age of 3.0 years (+/- 2.4 years SD; range: 3 weeks to 9 years) were enrolled. 83.2% were intubated using the lightwand, including 75.5% (34 of 45) of infants weighing less than 10 kg. Of the 21 failed intubations, 8 were due to an inappropriately large endotracheal tube, as recognized during direct laryngoscopy; 4 were due to other reasons discussed; and 9 (persistent vallecular or esophageal entry) could not be explained from videotape analysis. Factors contributing to successful intubation included: (1) use of a shoulder roll and slight head extension; (2) conscientious alignment of airway axes; (3) anterior jaw lift to elevate the epiglottis; and (4) gentle handling of the lightwand to avoid displacing soft tissue. Inability to advance the lightwand despite correct glow is caused by entrapment in the vallecula, hang up of the lightwand on the aryepiglottic folds, subglottic narrowing, or vocal cord closure. Conclusions: Lightwand intubation in children uses both tactile and visual cues regarding the location of the endotracheal tube tip. Attention to detail results in a high level of success among novice users of the pediatric lightwand. Endoscopic and external videotaping gave us a means of monitoring the progress of mechanical skills among novice users.",0,0
14503127,Comparison of two methods for predicting difficult intubation in obstetric patients,"Preoperative airway assessment for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation was done using the modified Mallampati test and Wilson risk sum score in three hundred and seventy two obstetric patients undergoing elective as well as emergency Cesarean section under general anesthesia. 25 (6.7%) patients had laryngoscopy grade III or IV of whom 24 (6.4%) patients were difficult at tracheal intubation. Mallampati class III or IV predicted 15 of the 23 patients while Wilson risk sum score > or = 2 predicted 9 of the 14 patients in whom tracheal intubation was difficult. As a screening test for prediction of difficult intubation Wilson risk sum score was less sensitive (36%) but had almost same specificity (98.5%) and positive predictive value (64%) in comparison to modified Mallampati test (62.5%, 97.7% and 65% respectively). When used as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for modified Mallampati test were 60%, 97.6% and 65% respectively and for Wilson risk sum they were 36%, 98.5% and 64% respectively, but when both tests were combined as predictors (with either of tests positive) sensitivity improved to 100% while specificity was marginally decreased to 96.2% and positive predictive value (64.8%) remained almost the same. There was no significant association between age and laryngoscopy grade III or IV but there was significant (P < 0.01) relationship with weight and external laryngeal manipulation. The advantage of the above tests lies in, incorporating them into the preoperative protocol, rather than using them as sole predictors of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation.",0,0

10155437,Using interactive videodisc to test advanced airway management skills,"Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Actronics Interactive Learning System to teach the psychomotor skills of advanced airway management compared to the traditional method of lecture/demonstration. Methods: The study was a nonrandomized, nonequivalent comparison group design of a convenience sample of 86 American Heart Association (AHA), advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) students, who obtained instruction in airway management by the interactive videodisc (IVD) learning system (n = 41), or by the traditional method of demonstration/return demonstration (n = 45). The evaluation criteria for the students were based on the number of attempts required to perform successfully endotracheal (ET) intubation and esophageal obturator airway (EOA) insertion. Results: No statistically significant differences in the performance of ET insertion between the IVD and the traditional method of instruction could be demonstrated. However, initial certifiers for ACLS learning EOA insertion by the IVD method had a treatment effect (p = 0.004) compared to ACLS students learning by the traditional method. This treatment effect was not noted with ET intubation and EOA insertion for students seeking recertification. In a post-test satisfaction questionnaire, 34 IVD students reported satisfaction with learning airway management using this instructional method, but also expressed a preference to have an ACLS instructor available. Conclusion: This study highlights the role of IVD in teaching the complex skills of advanced airway management.",0,0
17976562,Effect of a focused and directed continuing education program on prehospital skill maintenance in key resuscitation areas,"US Army Medics (formerly MOS 91B) received training similar to EMT-B level but were not required to be certified. Medics additionally received training in such skills as intravenous (i.v.) line insertion and fluid resuscitation. Continuing education, although encouraged, was not required. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a focused and directed psychomotor skills continuing education program in maintaining skills performance over a 6-month period in four key resuscitation areas. The education effect was the focus of the analysis. The study population was a convenience sample of medics with 1-4 years experience assigned to field units at Ft. Hood, TX. Subjects received a pretest evaluation of skills performance in four key areas using standard NREMT skill sheets. Scores on skill evaluations represent the percentage of steps correctly performed. After pretest evaluations, subjects were required to complete a comprehensive and focused continuing education program that emphasized skill practice. After the 6-month pretest, a post-test was conducted. Pre- and post-test scores for each student were matched. A one-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare results before and after the intervention, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. The total sample of subjects available for the post-test (n =107) was compared to the initial pretest sample (n = 127) and shown to be accurately representative. The pretest performance for the skills of i.v. insertion, airway management, patient assessment, and bleeding control was 79 +/- 11, 73 +/- 14, 44 +/- 22, and 57 +/- 13, respectively. The post-test performance for these same skills increased (p < 0.05) in all cases when compared to pretest scores: 87 +/- 9, 76 +/- 15, 73 +/- 19, and 62 +/- 14, respectively.

14508309,Mouth opening: a new angle,"Background: The authors hypothesized that craniocervical extension occurs during normal mouth opening. Methods: Twenty volunteers were studied. Interdental distance was measured at four different degrees of craniocervical extension. Results: Interdental distance increased from 28 mm (95% confidence interval, 25-30) in slight flexion to 46 mm (95% confidence interval, 42-49) at full extension. Nearly maximal mouth opening was obtained with 26 degrees (95% confidence interval, 22-30) of craniocervical extension from neutral. Conclusion: Craniocervical extension is an integral part of complete mouth opening in conscious subjects. Fixation of the craniocervical junction by disease, an internal or external fixation device, or technique may restrict mouth opening, with consequences for airway management.",0,0
25886432,"Betel quid, chewing habits and difficult intubation: A case report and critical appraisal of evidence for practice","Betel quid is used by 10-20% of world of population. Oral submucus fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic premalignant disease common in South Asian countries where betel quid is chewed. It is characterized by juxtaepithelial fibrosis of oral cavity and limited mouth opening, which can cause difficult intubation. A recent study in Taiwan has revealed long-term betel nut chewing is not predictor of difficult intubation. We describe two cases of OSF and critically analyze this study and its implications for clinical practice. OSF is now seen in Saudi Arabia and western countries with use of commercial betel quid substitutes. Although betel quid without tobacco is used in Taiwan, available evidence suggests rapid and early development of OSF where commercial chewing products like Pan Masala are used in India. Effects of betel quid may vary depending on the composition of quid and chewing habits. Studies where personal habits are involved must be analyzed carefully for external validity. Even though, Taiwan study is controlled, its validity outside Taiwan is highly questionable. Since OSF can cause unanticipated difficult intubation, thus during preanesthetic assessment, history of betel quid chewing, more importantly use of commercial chewing products is more likely to give clues to severity of OSF and possible difficult intubation. Further controlled trails in populations where commercial chewing products are used is necessary to detect association of chewing habits and difficult intubation.",0,0
24050606,[Cervical spine instability in the surgical patient],"Many congenital and acquired diseases, including trauma, may result in cervical spine instability. Given that airway management is closely related to the movement of the cervical spine, it is important that the anesthesiologist has detailed knowledge of the anatomy, the mechanisms of cervical spine instability, and of the effects that the different airway maneuvers have on the cervical spine. We first review the normal anatomy and biomechanics of the cervical spine in the context of airway management and the concept of cervical spine instability. In the second part, we review the protocols for the management of cervical spine instability in trauma victims and some of the airway management options for these patients.",0,0
19489473,The incidence of difficult intubation in 2000 patients undergoing thyroid surgery--a single center expirience,"Background/aim: The incidence of difficult intubation (DI) is 1-10%, and DI leading to inability to intubate occurs in 0.04% of the population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of DI in thyroid surgery and to assess possible correlation of difficult tracheal intubation with sex and primary diagnosis. Methods: We studied 2000 consecutive patients (1705 females) scheduled for thyroid surgery who were assessed for DI prior to general anesthesia, with respect to primary disease diagnosis and sex. Patients were divided into four groups: patients with nodal goiter (group A), polynodal goiter (group B), hyperthyroidism (group C) and thyroid carcinoma (group D). Difficult intubation was predicted using the scoring system which included 13 parameters ranged from 0 to 2. Additive score > 5 was accepted as a predictor of DI. True DI was defined as impossible visualization of glottis with direct laryngoscopy (grade III and IV). Results: Difficult intubation was observed in 110/2000 patients (5.5%). The incidence of DI was higher in males (26/295, 8.8%) than females (84/1705, 4.9%) (p < 0.01). The incidence of DI was highest in the group B (6.2%). Extremely DI occurred in 15/2000 patients (0.75%), the most of them in the group C (1.1%). Sensitivity of used scoring system was 91.8% and specificity 86.5%. Conclusions: The incidence of DI was higest in patients with polynodal goiter but extremly DI was present mostly in patients with hyperthiroidism. Men seem to be at higher risk for DI than women. Scoring system used in this study for prediction of DI may be useful in this patient population.",0,0
22074029,The effect of sterilisation on the plasticity of multi-use Eschmann gum elastic bougies: a bench and manikin study,"We investigated the deterioration in plasticity of the multi-use Portex Tracheal Guide ('bougie') with repeated sterilisation. Six bougies were prepared by washing them between 0 and 100 times (in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines). Two tests were employed: a bench test in which rapid serial photographs were taken of the bougies uncoiling from a preformed curve; and a manikin-based test in which the six bougies were used in a simulated difficult airway. The bench test demonstrated a progressive deterioration in plasticity with repeated washing. However, the manikin-based test showed no significant difference between bougies in the incidence of oesophageal placement (p = 0.74). Time to placement differed significantly only between the two most-washed bougies but was broadly similar. We suggest therefore that the manufacturer's limit of five washings may be unnecessarily cautious.",0,0
24624275,An awake double lumen endotracheal tube intubation using the Clarus Video System in a patient with an epiglottic cyst: a case report,"A 54-year-old male patient was scheduled for an elective pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with video-assisted thoracic surgery at our hospital. This patient had a history of intubation failure in other institutions due to an epiglottic cyst. An airway assessment of the patient was normal. A preoperative laryngoscopy revealed a bulging epiglottic mass covering most of the epiglottis and occupying most of the pharyngeal space. The patient was administered intravenous midazolam 1 mg, fentanyl 50 µg, and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg. A bilateral superior laryngeal nerve block was then performed with 2% lidocaine 2 ml on each side. A 10% lidocaine spray was applied on to the oropharynx. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen over 10 minutes, a rigid fiberscope with an optical stylet loaded with a 37 Fr double lumen endotracheal tube was inserted orally and passed into the glottic aperture.

Preoperative examinations failed to defect signs of a possible difficult intubation. Laryngoscopy showed a true glottis, but it was impossible to insert tube No. 6 in the trachea. Failure of attempts at intubation made us use a laryngeal mask for maintaining the patency of the upper airways. Anesthesia coursed smoothly in the presence of stable hemodynamics and gas exchange. Use of laryngeal mask helped solve the problem of unpredictable difficult intubation and provide reliable patency of the upper respiratory airways in a female patient with latent stenosis of the subglottal space.",0,0
15674508,The incidence and risk factors of difficult mask ventilation,"Purpose: The ability to ventilate and oxygenate a patient using a bag-mask breathing system may be lifesaving in the case of failure of the initial intubation attempt. In this study, we aimed to determine the incidence of difficult mask ventilation (DMV) and to find preoperative risk factors for this procedure. Methods: Based on methods used for overcoming some difficulties with bag-mask ventilation (MV), classification has been made into four categories: easy MV, awkward MV, difficult MV, and impossible MV. A univariate analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors predicting DMV, followed by a stepwise forward binary logistic regression, and the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. Results: A total of 576 patients were studied. Incidence of easy MV, awkward MV, and difficult MV were found to be 75.5% (n = 435), 16.7% (n = 96), and 7.8% (n = 45), respectively. Height, weight, age, male gender, increased Mallampati class, history of snoring, lack of teeth, and beard were found to be DMV risk factors (P < 0.05). Using a multivariate analysis, Mallampati class 4, male, history of snoring, age, and weight were found to be significantly associated with DMV. Although the incidence of DMV in general was 7.8% (n = 45), the incidence of DMV among patients with difficult intubation (n = 123) was found to be 15.5% (n = 19). Conclusions: Mallampati class 4, male patients, history of snoring, increasing age, and increasing weight were found to be risk factors for DMV in our study.",1,1
21804715,Randomized double-blind comparison of ketamine-propofol and fentanyl-propofol for the insertion of laryngeal mask airway in children,"Background: Till date, different combinations of adjuncts with induction agents have been tried for Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) insertion; yet, the ideal combination that provides the best insertion conditions with minimal side effects has not been identified, particularly in children. PATIENTS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; Methods: Hundred paediatric ASA grade I and II patients, aged 3-12 years, were randomly allocated to receive intravenously either fentanyl 2μg kg(-1) (Group F, n=50) or ketamine 0.5 mg kg(-1) (Group K, n=50), before induction of anaesthesia with propofol 3.5 mg kg(-1). Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured before induction (baseline), immediately before induction, immediately before LMA insertion, and at 1, 3 and 5 minutes after LMA insertion. Following LMA insertion, the following six subjective endpoints were graded by a blinded anaesthetist using ordinal scales graded 1 to 3: mouth opening, gagging, swallowing, head and limb movements, laryngospasm and resistance to insertion. Duration and incidence of apnoea was also recorded. Results: The incidence of resistance to mouth opening, resistance to LMA insertion and incidence of swallowing was not statistically significant between the two groups. Coughing/ gagging was seen in 8% patients in group K as compared to 28% patients in group K. Limb/ head movements were observed in 64% patients in the fentanyl group and in 76% patients in the ketamine group. Laryngospasm was not seen in any patient in either group. Incidence of apnoea was 80% in the fentanyl group and 50% in the ketamine group. The heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were consistently higher in the ketamine group as compared to the fentanyl group. Conclusion: The combination of fentanyl (2μg kg-1) and propofol (3.5mg kg-1) provides better conditions for LMA insertion in children than a combination of ketamine (0.5 mg kg-1) and propofol (3.5mg kg-1).",0,0
8773859,Inter-observer reliability of ten tests used for predicting difficult tracheal intubation,"Purpose: To determine inter-observer reliability of ten preoperative airway assessment tests used for predicting difficult tracheal intubation. Method: We prospectively assessed 59 patients undergoing elective surgery requiring tracheal intubation at a large metropolitan teaching hospital. Two experienced observers independently conducted the airway assessment tests on the same group of patients. Inter-observer reliability was examined using Kappa (K) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Two tests--mouth opening (ICC = 0.93) and chin protrusion (ICC = 0.89)--had excellent inter-observer reliability. Seven tests--thyromental distance (ICC - 0.74), subluxation (K = 0.66), atlanto-occipital extension distance (ICC = 0.67) and angle (K = 0.66), profile classification (K = 0.58), ramus length (ICC = 0.53), oropharyngeal best view (K = 0.49)--were moderately reliable. One test--Mallampati technique of assessing oropharyngeal view (K = 0.31)--had poor reliability. Conclusion: Many of the preoperative airway tests have only moderate inter-observer reliability. This may provide some insight into why previous research has failed to show that the tests accurately predict difficult tracheal intubation.",0,0
10781116,"Randomised double-blind comparison of fentanyl, mivacurium or placebo to facilitate laryngeal mask airway insertion","In a double-blind randomised study, we compared conditions during insertion of the laryngeal mask airway in 150 patients who received either fentanyl 1 microg.kg-1, mivacurium 0.04 mg.kg-1 or normal saline, before induction of anaesthesia with propofol 2 mg.kg-1. Insertion conditions, including mouth opening, swallowing, gagging or coughing, head or limb movement and ease of insertion, were each graded using a three-point scale. The median (interquartile range) summed insertion scores were more favourable with the use of fentanyl [8.0 (7.0-9.0)] and mivacurium [7.5 (6.8-8.3)] than with normal saline [9.0 (7.8-10.3); p < 0.01]. Fentanyl and mivacurium decreased swallowing and head or limb movement, and mivacurium improved mouth opening. Insertion conditions were similar between fentanyl and mivacurium, while both prolonged apnoea. Fentanyl and mivacurium are equally effective in facilitating insertion of the laryngeal mask airway following anaesthetic induction with propofol.",0,0

8142105,Anesthetic management of the patient scheduled for head and neck cancer surgery,"For the patient scheduled for head and neck cancer surgery, careful assessment of the airway demonstrates the most appropriate course of action for securing the airway before surgery begins. Often the patient may be anesthetized safely before intubation of the trachea. The patient may require an awake examination of the airway under sedation and topical analgesia or an awake fiberoptic intubation before the induction of general anesthesia. To secure the airway in some patients, a tracheostomy may be needed. After the operation, extubation of the trachea requires careful attention and may be even more of a challenge than the original intubation. Current principles and techniques for the anesthetic management of the patient undergoing head and neck cancer surgery are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on avoiding the airway problems associated with this kind of surgery.",0,0
23825817,Comparison of glottic visualisation and ease of intubation with different laryngoscope blades,"Context: Literature suggests glottic view is better with straight blades while tracheal intubation is easier with curved blades. Aims: To compare glottic view and ease of intubation with Macintosh, Miller, McCoy blades and the Trueview(®) laryngoscope. Settings and design: This prospective randomised study was undertaken in operation theatres of a 550 bedded tertiary referral cancer centre after approval from the Institutional Review Board. Methods: We compared the Macintosh, Miller, McCoy blades and the Trueview(®) laryngoscope for glottic visualisation and ease of tracheal intubation; in 120 patients undergoing elective cancer surgery; randomly divided into four groups. After induction of anaesthesia laryngoscopy was performed and trachea intubated. We recorded: Visualisation of glottis (Cormack Lehane grade), ease of intubation, number of attempts; need to change the blade and need for external laryngeal manipulation. Statistical analysis: Demographic data, Mallampati classification were compared using the Chi-square test. A P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: Grade 1 view was obtained most often (87% patients) with Trueview(®) laryngoscope. Intubation was easier (Grade 1) with Trueview(®) and McCoy blades (93% each). Seven patients needed two attempts; one patient in Miller group needed three attempts. No patient in McCoy and Trueview(®) Groups required external laryngeal manipulation. Conclusions: We found that in patients with normal airway glottis was best visualised with Miller blade and Trueview(®) laryngoscope however, the trachea was more easily intubated with McCoy and Macintosh blades and Trueview(®) laryngoscope.",0,0
18074663,Prediction of difficult laryngoscopy: does obesity play a role?,"Objectives: This study was intended to 1) identify preoperative predictors of difficult laryngoscopy and 2) determine the role of obesity in difficulty of obtaining adequate laryngeal exposure. Methods: A prospective study was undertaken of 63 patients who were undergoing elective direct laryngoscopy. Thirty-six patients met the obesity criteria (body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2). Measurements of height, weight, and neck circumference and Mallampati and Cormack-Lehane scores were obtained. The ease of laryngeal exposure was recorded by the attending surgeon on a visual analog scale (VAS; 1 to 10). Difficult laryngeal exposure (DLE) was defined as a VAS score of at least 3. The candidate morphological predictors were investigated. Results: Obesity and Mallampati score were found to be predictors of DLE (p < .001). The VAS score was positively correlated with body mass index (p = .007), weight (p = .05), Mallampati score (p < .001), and Cormack-Lehane score (p < .001). Among obese patients, the VAS score was correlated with the Cormack-Lehane score (p = .01), whereas in nonobese patients the VAS score showed a significant association with both the Mallampati (p = .02) and Cormack-Lehane (p = .01) scores. Conclusions: Obese patients and those with a Mallampati score of at least 2 posed a significantly higher risk of DLE. Preoperative identification of a potentially difficult airway may aid surgical planning and allow more effective communication with a collaborating anesthesiologist.",0,0
8486031,The bronchitis index. A semiquantitative visual scale for the assessment of airways inflammation,"Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy has been proven to be an effective tool for the assessment and characterization of airway inflammation. Visual inspection of airways affected by chronic bronchitis discloses an abnormal appearance characterized by erythema, edema, secretions, and friability. It was hypothesized that the visual appearance of airway inflammation could be assessed in a semiquantitative manner. A bronchitis index (BI) was developed that scores the visual appearance of airways according to the presence or absence of abnormal edema, erythema, secretions, and friability (0 = normal, 3 = remarkably abnormal). The BI was determined in three study groups: 86 subjects with chronic bronchitis, 15 subjects who smoked cigarettes, but did not have chronic bronchitis, and 25 normal, nonsmoking control subjects. The reproducibility of the BI was determined by comparing the results from pairs of two independent observers assessing 249 subjects undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy under various investigative protocols. In total, nine investigators scored the airways. For the three observer pairs with more than six observations, there were no differences noted in the BI (p = 0.43, 0.67, 0.82). To control for the effect of cough upon the BI, lidocaine usage was recorded. No correlation was found between lidocaine usage and BI. As previously noted for a smaller group of subjects, the BI was found to be elevated in those with chronic bronchitis (13.2 +/- 0.53) compared with both asymptomatic smokers (8.5 +/- 0.89, p < 0.0005) and normal volunteers (2.3 +/- 0.55, p < 0.0001); the latter two groups also differed significantly (p < 0.0001). The BI was also found to correlate significantly with bronchial sample lavage fluid neutrophil content in lavage fluid obtained after determination of the BI and with cigarette smoking as quantitated by pack years. Conversely, the BI correlated negatively with the spirometric measures of airway obstruction, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEV25-75, and FEFmax. Thus, the BI appears to be a reproducible, semiquantitative assessment of the visual appearance of airway inflammation. It may be a useful bronchoscopic adjunct for the assessment of airway inflammation in clinical investigations.",0,0
15894845,The lingual tonsillar hyperplasia in relation to unanticipated difficult intubation: is there any relationship between lingual tonsillar hyperplasia and tonsillectomy?,"The lingual tonsillar hyperplasia (LTH) is a rare and dangerous condition of the upper airway because it is one of several risks during intubation which can cause serious complications like cardiac arrest, cerebral anoxia, and death. The LTH is rarely detectable during a routine oropharyngeal examination. The lingual tonsil is of particular interest to forensic medicine to assess cases with malpractice in connection with intubation difficulties. Our study looked at how often autopsy specimens had enlarged lingual tonsils and whether any relationship existed between LTH and tonsillectomies. In total, 497 corpses were examined. Only in 16 cases (3.2%), an enlarged lingual tonsil was detected. Of the 16 cases, 10 (62.5%) had normal palatine tonsils; the other 6 cases (37.5%) had no palatine tonsils or were scarred, atrophied, or only remnants remained. Statistically, it was not possible to prove any relationship between enlarged lingual tonsils and tonsillectomies. From the forensic point of view, a description of the lingual tonsil should appear in special cases in autopsy reports. When reviewing malpractice cases, special anatomic features should be described.",0,0
21991181,Initial release of severe post-burn contracture scar of the neck for intubation under ketamine,"Background. Severe anterior post-burn contracture (PBC) of the neck poses the anaesthesiologist some difficult problems and results in difficult intubation when extension of the atlanto-occipital joint is impaired. Such patients must therefore have the PBC scar released before other procedures are performed, in order to ensure airway control. Objectives. To show our experience with quick surgical neck release of patients with severe anterior PBC of the neck to facilitate direct laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation (OTI). Material and methods. A prospective study of patients with severe anterior PBC of the neck was carried out from January 2003 to December 2007 in the Burns Unit of Mosul Teaching Hospital in Mosul, Iraq. The patients were given ketamine, after which a release incision was made over the anterior PBC of the neck scar. OTI was then performed successfully. Results. Twelve patients with severe neck PBC (3 males, 9 females; age range, 7-37 yr; mean age, 20 yr) all had successful OTI after PBC release under intravenous ketamine. None showed any complications attributed to the anaesthesia.",0,0
19400497,Magnetic resonance scanning of the upper airway following difficult intubation reveals an unexpected lingual tonsil,"We present a case of a 40-year-old woman requiring elective surgery who had an unexpected Grade 4 Cormack and Lehane laryngoscopy view. Both curved and straight laryngoscope blades in the sniffing and hyperextended head and neck positions were used. Endotracheal intubation was accomplished with some difficulty using a No. 3 Macintosh blade and Frova intubating catheter in the sniffing position. The cause of the difficult laryngoscopy was a lingual tonsil as shown in postoperative magnetic resonance scans. We feel that a comprehensive postoperative evaluation should be conducted after every difficult laryngoscopy (Cormack and Lehane Grade 3b and 4). The use of magnetic resonance imaging may provide important objective information for both the anaesthetist and the patient, allowing a better understanding of causes and possible solutions for future airway management.",0,0
9195358,Pseudocholinesterase hyperactivity with succinylcholine resistance: an unusual cause of difficult intubation,"We describe a case of difficult intubation, possibly due to marked pseudocholinesterase hyperactivity that caused rapid inactivation of succinycholine. Possible causes of difficult intubation and pseudocholinesterase hyperactivity are discussed. Literature on genetic variants associated with markedly increased pseudocholinesterase activity are reviewed. It is concluded that pseudocholinesterase hyperactivity may be a rare cause of difficult intubation. We recommend that pseudocholinesterase activity should be determined in all patients who appear to be resistant to the action of normal doses of succinylcholine or mivacurium.",0,0
26430529,Better Hemodynamic Profile of Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Compared to Laryngoscopy and Tracheal Intubation,"Background: Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation can cause serious cardiovascular responses in patients such as hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias. Alternative airway maintenance techniques may attenuate these hemodynamic stress responses. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the immediate hemodynamic effects of the insertion of laryngeal mask airway supreme (LMA-S) and classic (LMA-C) with laryngoscopy and Endotracheal Intubation (ETT). Patients and methods: This study was a prospective, double-blind, and randomized clinical trial conducted on 150 patients aged 18 to 50 years with ASA I (American Society of Anesthesiologists), in the general operating room of Shahid Mohammadi hospital, Hormozgan university of medical sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran. In the ETT group, endotracheal intubation was performed using the Macintosh laryngoscope; while for the LMA-C and LMA-S groups, LMA Classic and LMA Supreme were inserted, respectively. The induction and maintenance of anesthesia were similar in all patients. The hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured before (baseline) and after induction of anesthesia at 4 different time points. The statistical analysis was done and P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Participants in all groups were similar in terms of gender, age, weight, height, and Mallampati class. The mean ± SD of SBPs (105.62 ± 12.12, 112.90 ± 12.2, and 112.48 ± 15.14 mm Hg, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) and DBPs (64.64 ± 10.23, 73.78 ± 9.70, and 71.20 ± 12.27 mm Hg, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) were significantly lower in the ETT group compared to LMA groups 5 minutes after device insertion (P < 0.01 for SBPs and P < 0.001 for DBPs); however these values were lower than the baseline values in all groups. There were no differences in the mean SBP and DBPs between the three groups at the other time points. The mean ± SD heart rates in the ETT group, compared to the LMA-C and LMA-S groups, were considerably higher in the first minute (100.06 ± 18.27, 82.50 ± 10.52, and 82.00 ± 13.60 bpm, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S), third minute (91.04 ± 17.12, 78.84 ± 11.23, and 78.90 ± 13.41 bpm, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) and fifth minute (85.82 ± 16.01, 75.78 ± 11.73, and 75.04 ± 13.90 bpm, respectively for ETT, LMA-C, and LMA-S) after intubation (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the LMA-C and LMA-S groups in terms of hemodynamic parameters. Conclusions: Maintaining the airway using laryngeal mask airway is associated with less cardiovascular responses compared to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.",0,0
12492669,A comparison of simulated difficult intubation with multiple-use and single-use bougies in a manikin,"In a randomised cross-over study, 20 anaesthetists attempted to place a multiple- or single-use bougie in the trachea of a manikin, in which a grade 3 Cormack and Lehane laryngoscopic view was simulated. The anaesthetists made two attempts at placement with each bougie and were blinded to success (tracheal placement) or failure (oesophageal placement). The success rates for the first attempts with the multiple- and single-use bougies were 85 and 15%, respectively [mean (95% CI) difference between the two bougies 70% (40-84%); p < 0.001]. The success rates for the second attempts were similar to those for the first attempts with both bougies. There is an increased risk of failure to intubate the trachea when using a single-use bougie, and this must be weighed against the unquantified risk of cross-infection from prions when using a multiple-use bougie.",0,0
21179292,Comparison of the laryngeal view during intubation using Airtraq and Macintosh laryngoscopes in patients with cervical spine immobilization and mouth opening limitation,"Background: For patients suspicious of cervical spine injury, a Philadelphia cervical collar is usually applied. Application of Philadelphia cervical collar may cause difficult airway. The aim of this study was to evaluate the laryngeal view and the success rate at first intubation attempt of the Airtraq and conventional laryngoscopy in patients with simulated cervical spine injury after application of a Philadelphia cervical collar. Methods: Anesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. After a Philadelphia cervical collar applied, patients were randomly assigned to tracheal intubation with an Airtraq (Group A, n = 25) or with conventional laryngoscopy (Group L, n = 25). Measurements included intubation time, success rate of first intubation attempt, number of intubation attempts, and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded at baseline, just before and after intubation. Results: The success rate of the first attempt in Group A (96%) was significantly greater than with the Group L (40%). POGO score was significantly greater in Group A (84 ± 20%) than in Group L (6 ± 11%). The duration of successful intubation at first tracheal intubation attempt and hemodynamic changes were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: The Airtraq offers a better laryngeal view and higher success rate at first intubation attempt in patients who are applied with a Philadelphia cervical collar due to suspicion of cervical spine injury.",0,0
9750689,[Improvement of glottis visualization with a McCoy blade],"Difficult intubation remains one of the major risks in anaesthetic practice. Recently, as other anaesthetic societies, the French Society for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR) has produced algorithms for the management of a difficult intubation. New laryngoscopes and blades have been marketed in recent years, however their place in these algorithms remains unclear. In this preliminary study, we compared the laryngoscopic view in 100 consecutive patients during tracheal intubation with the McCoy laryngoscope first in its normal position and after levering the distal part of the blade. All patients were included in Mallampati classes 1 and 2. Among them, 16% were classified as Cormack and Lehane grades 3 or 4 when using the blade in the normal position. These data confirm previous observations showing that the McCoy blade in normal position performs poorly as compared with the Macintosh blade. Conversely the levering of the distal part of the blade significantly decreased the incidence of Cormack and Lehane grades of 3 or 4 (2 versus 16%, P = 0.001). It is concluded that the McCoy blade is not convenient for its routine use in patients not to be at preoperatively known risk of difficult intubation. This blade significantly improves intubating conditions. Defining the exact place of this new blade in difficult intubation algorithms requires further studies.",0,0
26261824,"Comparison of five methods in predicting difficult laryngoscopy: Neck circumference, neck circumference to thyromental distance ratio, the ratio of height to thyromental distance, upper lip bite test and Mallampati test","Background: Preoperative airway assessment tests have been presented to help in anticipating a difficult airway. We conducted this study to compare five methods in prediction of difficult laryngoscopy: Neck circumference (NC), NC to thyromental distance ratio (NC/TMD), the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD), upper lip bite test (ULBT) and Mallampati test (MMT). These five methods are the most commonly used ones and have different powers for it. It was not clear which of these methods predicts difficult laryngoscopy better. Materials and methods: Six hundred consecutive patients participated in this study. NC, NC/TMD and RHTMD were measured, and ULBT and MMT were performed and recorded. The laryngoscopy view was graded according to Cormack and Lehane's scale (CLS) and difficult laryngoscopy was defined as CLS grades 3 and 4. Accuracy of tests in predicting difficult laryngoscopy was assessed using the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve. Results: The area under the curve in ULBT and RHTMD were significantly larger than that in TMD, NC and MMT. No statistically significant differences were noted between TMD, NC and MMT (all P > 0.05) (ULBT = RHTMD > NC/TMD > TMD = NC = MMT). RHTMD (>22.7 cm) exhibited the highest sensitivity (sensitivity = 64.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 53.9-74.7) and the most specific test was ULBT (specificity = 99.41%, 95% CI: 98.3-99.9). Conclusion: RHTMD and ULBT as simple preoperative bedside tests have a higher level of accuracy compared to NC/TMD, TMD, NC, MMT in predicting a difficult airway.",1,1
2604284,Intraluminal airway inflammation in chronic bronchitis. Characterization and correlation with clinical parameters,"In order to characterize intraluminal airway inflammation in subjects with chronic bronchitis, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed in 28 subjects with chronic bronchitis with fixed airway obstruction and, for comparison, 15 asymptomatic smokers and 25 normal nonsmoking volunteers. The chronic bronchitics had a cough productive of sputum on most days of the month for 6 months in the preceding 2 yr, had at least one exacerbation requiring medical intervention in each of the previous 2 yr, and had an FEV1 less than 76% of predicted without response to bronchodilator. During bronchoscopy the airways were assessed for visual evidence of inflammation by assigning them a score, the bronchitis index, that graded the airways according to the apparent severity of airway edema, erythema, friability, and secretions. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by sequentially instilling and retrieving with gentle suction five 20-ml aliquots of sterile normal saline into each of three separate lobes. The first aliquots, the ""bronchial"" sample, were pooled and processed separately from the final four aliquots, the ""distal"" sample. Cell counts, cell differentials, and albumin were determined for both the bronchial and distal samples. In order to correlate inflammation with clinical parameters, sputum was collected for 24 h prior to bronchoscopy; spirometry was performed just prior to bronchoscopy, and smoking histories were obtained. Visual inspection of the airways, as quantified by the bronchitis index, demonstrated significantly more evidence for inflammation in the chronic bronchitics than in either the asymptomatic smokers or the normal subjects. The bronchial sample lavage fluids from the chronic bronchitics tended to contain more cells (6.1 +/- 2.2 x 10(6) cells) than the bronchial sample fluids from the asymptomatic smokers (3.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(6) cells) or normal subjects (3.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(6) cells). Furthermore, the chronic bronchitics had a higher percentage of neutrophils in their bronchial lavage fluid (35.8 +/- 5.6%) than did either the asymptomatic smokers (20.7 +/- 2.6%, p = 0.0001) or the normal subjects (10.3 +/- 5.6%). The distal sample lavage fluid also recovered more neutrophils from both the chronic bronchitics (15.0 +/- 4.2%, p = 0.0012) and asymptomatic smokers (5.7 +/- 1.3%, p = 0.002) than from the normal subjects (2.8 +/- 0.4%). The chronic bronchitics were divided into two groups: those with low (less than 20%) and those with high (greater than 20%) bronchial sample neutrophils. Those with higher bronchial sample neutrophils had significantly more sputum production and lower FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75 than did the subjects with lower bronchial sample neutrophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,0
26316318,Obesity in children with different risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea: a community-based study,"This study investigated the association between obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in preschool and school-age children. Parents of obese and randomly chosen normal weight children completed a questionnaire on sleep-related symptoms, demography, family, and medical history. All subjects were invited to undergo polysomnography (PSG). OSA cases were defined as obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI) ≥1. A total of 5930 children were studied with 9.5% obese (11.9% boys/6.1% girls), 205/2680 preschool and 360/3250 school children. There were 1030 children (535 obese/495 normal weight) who underwent PSG. OSA was higher in obese children and obese school children had higher OAHI, arousal index, and shorter total sleep time. However, there was no positive correlation between OSA and body mass index (BMI). The main risk factors for OSA in preschool children were adenotonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent respiratory tract infection. The main cause for OSA in school children was a history of parental snoring and obesity. Mallampati scores and sleep-related symptoms were found to be associated with OSA in both preschool and school children. Conclusion: We demonstrated differential risk factors for OSA in obese children, which suggest that a different mechanism may be involved in OSA development in preschool and school-age children. What is known: Various risk factors have been reported in obese children with OSA owing to the different age and different study design. Obese children have a higher prevalence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA risk factors in obese children are affected by different ages and study designs. What is new: A differential prevalence and risk factors for obese preschool and school-age children with OSA has been demonstrated.",0,0
21982176,Modified glove fingers as an aid for safely navigating endotracheal tube through the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in difficult nasotracheal intubation,"A young female patient scheduled for orthognathic surgery under general anesthesia encountered obstacles during nasotracheal intubation in which the cuff of the nasal endotracheal tube was linearly lacerated and the tube tip impacted against the retropharyngeal wall. Repeated episodes of the event happened rendering the intubation unsuccessful. A technique using modified glove fingers was applied, which successfully protected the cuff from shearing by the sharp nasal crista and redirected the tube tip away from the retropharyngeal wall. It is a simple and applicable technique during nasotracheal intubation to prevent cuff damage and potential retropharyngeal dissection.",0,0
15933302,Crisis management during anaesthesia: difficult intubation,"Background: Anaesthetists may experience difficulty with intubation unexpectedly which may be associated with difficulty in ventilating the patient. If not well managed, there may be serious consequences for the patient. A simple structured approach to this problem was developed to assist the anaesthetist in this difficult situation. Objectives: To examine the role of a specific sub-algorithm for the management of difficult intubation. Methods: The potential performance of a structured approach developed by review of the literature and analysis of each of the relevant incidents among the first 4000 reported to the Australian Incident Monitoring Study (AIMS) was compared with the actual management as reported by the anaesthetists involved. Results: There were 147 reports of difficult intubation capable of analysis among the first 4000 incidents reported to AIMS. The difficulty was unexpected in 52% of cases; major physiological changes occurred in 37% of these cases. Saturation fell below 90% in 22% of cases, oesophageal intubation was reported in 19%, and an emergency transtracheal airway was required in 4% of cases. Obesity and limited neck mobility and mouth opening were the most common anatomical contributing factors. Conclusion: The data confirm previously reported failures to predict difficult intubation with existing preoperative clinical tests and suggest an ongoing need to teach a pre-learned strategy to deal with difficult intubation and any associated problem with ventilation. An easy-to-follow structured approach to these problems is outlined. It is recommended that skilled assistance be obtained (preferably another anaesthetist) when difficulty is expected or the patient's cardiorespiratory reserve is low. Patients should be assessed postoperatively to exclude any sequelae and to inform them of the difficulties encountered. These should be clearly documented and appropriate steps taken to warn future anaesthetists.",0,0
19393410,Pediatric tonsil size: objective vs subjective measurements correlated to overnight polysomnogram,"Objective: To compare subjective and objective tonsil size measurements (weight, volume, intertonsillar distance) along with simple pharyngeal measurements in the prediction of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) severity. Study design: Prospective case series. Subjects and methods: Tonsil size (0-4+) and Mallampati/Friedman palate position were subjectively measured. During adenotonsillectomy, tonsil size was objectively measured along with simple pharyngeal dimensions. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated and forward and reverse stepwise multivariate regression modeling was used to assess the prediction of preoperative OSAHS severity as determined by polysomnogram (PSG). Evaluation of possible outlier influence was also performed. Results: Thirty-four pediatric patients (median age, 4; range, 2-9) were included. Objective tonsil weight (Spearman's rho = 0.6143, P = 0.0002), tonsil volume (rho = 0.4960, P = 0.0039), and intertonsillar distance (rho = -0.7559, P < 0.0001) were strongly correlated with subjective tonsil size but not with age, body mass index (BMI), or preoperative apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Regression modeling demonstrated that only measured tonsil weight (beta = 1.43, P = 0.003), age (beta = -3.21, P = 0.001), and hard palate length (beta = 0.979, P = 0.003) were significant predictors of the preoperative AHI (R(2) = 0.5358). Evaluation of possible outliers indicated tonsil weight was the most robust predictor of preoperative AHI. Conclusion: Subjective tonsil size measurements correlate well with objective tonsil volume measurements. However, only objective tonsil measurements were significantly predictive of objective PSG-measured OSAHS severity.",0,0
20715541,[Retrospective investigation and analysis of dental injuries during endotracheal intubation],"Background: The objective of this study is to clarify the causes of dental injuries (DIs) developed during the direct laryngoscopy for the endotracheal intubation (EI) in our hospital. Methods: Subjects are 4173 patients who had the EI from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007. Mallampati's classification and Miller's classification were used for the evaluation of difficult airway and the dental unsteadiness, respectively. Results: There was no case between 10 and 40 years of age. Twelve cases (0.3%) had the DIs during the observation period. In 8 out of 12 cases (67%), EI was carried out by the residents with less than 3 months of the training period. Three cases (25%) were classified to the II or III grade. The dissociation of the evaluations by a dental anesthesiologist and medical anesthesiologists were found in two cases. Eight cases received temporary treatment by a dental anesthesiologist. Conclusions: Temporary treatment in the operating room was carried out by a dental anesthesiologist. Careful inquiry is needed for the proper preoperative teeth evaluation, especially in the schoolchild with milk teeth and elderly patients. A precise educational system for the residents is required for the prevention of DIs during the EI.",0,0
21335760,Comparison of a disposable bougie versus a newly designed malleable bougie in the intubation of a difficult manikin airway,"The endotracheal bougie is used for difficult intubations when only a minimal glottic view is obtained. Standard bougies are designed for use during direct, line-of-sight viewing of the glottic opening. With videolaryngoscopy, intubators ""see around the corner"", thus requiring a bougie which can be shaped to follow a significant curve. A malleable bougie with an imbedded internal wire was created to enable intubators to shape the curve to best fit a difficult airway. This pilot study examined the malleable bougie compared to the SunMed bougie in a simulated difficult airway intubation using video laryngoscopy.",0,0

23536490,A pilot staging system to predict persistent obstructive sleep apnea in children following adenotonsillectomy,"Objectives/hypothesis: A recent meta-analysis by Friedman et al. found that 66% of children have resolution of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (TA). However, accurate predictors of persistent OSA in children despite surgery are difficult to identify. We evaluate the utility of staging children with OSA using characteristics predictive of adult palatoplasty success. Study design: A retrospective analysis of children who underwent sleep studies before and after TA in a tertiary care center from 2008 through 2011. Methods: Tonsil size (TS)/modified Mallampati position score (MMP)/body mass index (BMI) z Score were used to categorize patients into a three- and four-stage tonsillectomy staging system. Stage 1 included patients with low MMP scores/large tonsils; stage 2 with low MMP scores/small tonsils or high MMP scores/large tonsils. Stage 3 included patients with high MMP scores/small tonsils. For the four-stage system, any patient with a BMI z Score ≥2.0 was stage 4. Results: Thirty-five patients (14 females) were included (mean age, 6.8 years; range, 1.0-18.6 years). OSA severity ranged from mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 10), to severe (n = 19), with a mean respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of 20.9 before surgery and 2.4 after. Similar to results seen for adult palatoplasty, staging by TS/MMP/BMI corresponded with response to surgery. In stage 1 to 2, 11/17 (64.7%) children had RDI <1.5 postoperatively, with decreasing TA success rates in stages 3 to 4 at 10/18 (55.5%). Although these results were not statistically significant (P = .14), the trend was similar to the adult analysis. Conclusions: A trend toward a dose-response relationship was seen between physical exam staging and persistent OSA after TA. Further data collection and analysis with a larger sample size are warranted.",0,0
19700284,Comparison of the EasyTube and endotracheal tube during general anesthesia in fasted adult patients,"Study objective: To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, ease of placement, and ventilatory parameters of a new alternate airway device, the EasyTube (EzT; Teleflex Ruesch, Research Triangle Park, NC), in comparison to the endotracheal tube (ETT). Design: Prospective, randomized controlled trial. Setting: University Hospital. Subjects: 200 adult ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for surgery. Interventions: Patients were randomized to two groups, one to receive ventilation via the EzT (n = 100) or the ETT (n = 100). After preoxygenation and induction with fentanyl and propofol, patients received muscle relaxation. The respective airway device was then inserted and mechanical ventilation was instituted. Measurements: Ease of insertion, number of insertion maneuvers, time until airtight seal of the airway was achieved, duration of surgery, leak pressure as well as arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) data, were recorded. Main results: Mallampati airway class was higher in the EzT group (P < 0.029), while thyromental distance showed no difference between the two groups. Ease of insertion was noted in the EzT group (P < 0.043). Number of insertions was equal in both groups; insertion time was shorter with the EzT (15.5 +/- 3.6 sec vs. 19.3 +/- 4.6 sec; P < 0.0001). Leak pressure and SpO(2) were not significantly different, while ETCO(2) was lower with the ETT (P < 0.024). Adjustments had to be made for two EzT group patients. No difference in frequency of laryngo-pharyngeal discomfort was observed in either group. Conclusion: Insertion of an EzT appears to reduce time and facilitate placement of an airway device when compared with direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.",0,0
7914166,A new device for blind oral intubation in routine and difficult airway management,"41 patients (ASA I-II) were intubated using a new device for blind oral intubation (Augustine Guide). A group of 33 consecutive patients (Mallampati I and II), was studied for routine intubation. Another group of eight patients (Mallampati III and IV) was selected to study the guide in difficult airway management. Intubation was successful in 31 of the 33 normal patients (two patients required a second attempt), and in seven of the eight patients in the difficult intubation group (three patients with two attempts). In the remaining three patients intubation had to be performed by direct laryngoscopy. One patient (Mallampati IV), was intubated by the Augustine guide after three unsuccessful attempts by direct laryngoscopy. The Augustine Guide proved to be helpful to intubating patients with an anterior larynx and receding mandible. However, blind oral intubation attempts required a median duration of 65 s (range 35-90 s). Patients with a low Mallampati score did not benefit from the new device.",0,0
19481853,Simulated rescue airway use by laypersons with scripted telephonic instruction,"Background: The King LT-D is a supraglottic airway with the potential for use by trained first responders in settings where access to advanced life support interventions by a physician or Emergency Medical Services may be delayed. Objectives: To determine the success rate of novice users in the telephone-directed placement of the King LT-D airway during a simulated respiratory arrest in order to establish the feasibility of conducting further study into use of the device by first responders after minimal training. Methods: We conducted a prospective study using 30 undergraduate students without medical training and a high-fidelity simulator. Subjects were instructed using a telephone-directed protocol to assess the airway, place the King LT-D and ventilate the simulator. Subjects were assessed on the successful placement of the King LT-D, time to placement, and perceived ease of use of the device. A Likert scale was used to identify the participant's perceptions. Subjects with CPR/AED certification were compared to those without such training. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a t-test. Results: The King airway was successfully placed in 80% (95% CI: 65; 95) of attempts. Success rate did not differ with prior CPR training. The median time to successful placement was 1min 50s (95% CI: 1min 6s; 2min 39s). The participants perceived the King LT-D to be easy to place in 90% (27/30) of cases. Conclusion: The King LT-D is simple enough to use, that it can be successfully placed by novice users with minimal telephonic instruction. This suggests that further studies could be conducted to determine the effect of King LT-D use on quality of airway management in scenarios depicting management of cardiac arrest by first responders in areas with delayed access to ALS interventions.",0,0
1589219,Tracheomalacia repair using ceramic rings,"Tracheomalacia resulting from tracheostomy or compressive thyroid disease often represents a difficult problem in airway management. In an attempt to improve this condition, biocompatible ceramic rings were surgically implanted in 16 patients to restore normal patency of the airway by first expanding the tracheal lumen lateral, and then in an anterior dimension. Preoperatively, patients displayed moderate to severe obstruction with marked restrictions in lifestyle, as confirmed by history, physical examination, and airway resistance studies. Additionally, three of these patients were trach-dependent at the time of implantation. Postoperatively all 16 patients have normal airway resistance parameters with a dramatic improvement in lifestyle, whereas the three with tracheostomy were successfully decannulated. The routine use of these rings has alleviated the need for rib/cartilage grafts, primary resections with anastomosis, prolonged periods of cannulation, and multiple surgeries. Our experience in the use of ceramic rings for tracheomalacia repair will be presented, highlighting selection criteria for their use, intraoperative placement, perioperative complications, and post-operative followup for a minimum of 6 months.",0,0
11257951,[Multicenter study on the usefulness of the NasOral system for the denitrogenation and apneic oxygenation in anesthesia],"Objectives: To study the usefulness of the NasOral system for denitrogenation prior to anesthetic induction for improving pulmonary oxygen storage that maintains SpO2 within the normal range during induced apnea and facilitates apneic oxygenation. Material and methods: To establish the study population of 125, five hospitals of the Valencian Community (Spain) enrolled patients scheduled for elective procedures under general anesthesia. The patients were preoxygenated using the NasOral system (denitrogenation). For two minutes, the patients inhaled oxygen through the nose (FiO2 1) at a flow rate of 8-10 l/min (never less than the patient's own minute volume) and exhaled orally through a unidirectional valve. We measured time of apnea with SpO2 > or = 96% to assess the usefulness of the device for denitrogenation. We also measured PetCO2 after endotracheal intubation and after maximum time of apnea (< or = 10 minutes) to assess use of the device for apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy. Results: We found no significant differences with regard to age, sex, ASA or Mallampati classification among patient groups enrolled at the participating hospitals. Cox's regression analysis was used to determine relative risk of SpO2 < 96%. At 10 minutes post-apnea, 88.8% of all patients maintained SpO2 > or = 96%. However, SpO2 > 96% was maintained by 94.1% in the Mallampati I group and by 84.1% in the Mallampati II group. SpO2 fell below the cut-off (< 96%) in 33.3% of obese patients and in 7.5% of non-obese patients. Analysis of the likelihood of SpO2 < 96% associated with the variables of obesity, sex, age, ASA and Mallampati classification was significant only for obesity, for which a risk of 1.95 was calculated relative to non-obesity (95% CI 1.14-3.35). The NasOral system allows performance of direct laryngoscopy for oral tracheal intubation, maintaining oxygen flow through the permeable airway to facilitate apneic oxygenation. Conclusions: The NasOral system facilitates denitrogenation before induction of anesthesia in all patients with permeable nasal fossae as well as apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy.",0,0
15947312,A prospective feasibility study of bronchial thermoplasty in the human airway,"Background: Bronchial thermoplasty is a novel procedure being developed as a potential treatment for asthma. Experience with animal studies has enabled development of appropriate reliable equipment, definition of therapeutic parameters, and descriptions of tissue effects of treatment. Study objectives: This study was undertaken to assess the feasibility and general safety of the application of bronchial thermoplasty in the human airway, and to determine if the reduction in airway smooth muscle seen in animal studies could be replicated. Design: A prospective study. Setting: Academic thoracic surgery center. Participants: Nine patients scheduled to undergo lung resection for suspected or proven lung cancer. Interventions: Bronchial thermoplasty was performed during routine preoperative bronchoscopy up to 3 weeks prior to prescheduled lung resection. Treatment was limited to areas of the segmental bronchi within the lobe that was to be removed. Treated airways were inspected via bronchoscopy at the time of thoracotomy, and were examined histologically following surgical resection. Results: There were no adverse clinical effects of the procedure, including no new symptoms and no unscheduled visits for medical care. Treated sites exhibited slight redness and edema of the mucosa within 2 weeks of treatment, and appeared normal at later time points. There was narrowing (visually estimated at 25 to 50%) in four airways in two subjects examined at 5 days and 13 days after treatment, with excess mucus in two of these airways. There was no bronchoscopic evidence of scarring in any of the airways examined. Histologic examination showed a reduction in airway smooth muscle, and the extent of the treatment effect was confined to the airway wall and the immediate peribronchial region. Conclusion: Application of bronchial thermoplasty to the human airway appears to be well tolerated. Treatment resulted in significant reduction of smooth muscle mass in the airways. Bronchial thermoplasty may provide therapeutic benefit in disease states such as asthma.",0,0
22008586,Factors associated with difficult intubation in prehospital emergency medicine,"Objectives: When managing airways in a prehospital setting, emergency physicians have to deal with difficult intubation (DI), which increases morbidity and mortality. The primary goal of this study was to determine predictors of DI in the out-of-hospital field faced by the French physician-staffed Emergency Medical Service. Methods: The study was a prospective, observational study, including all consecutive patients intubated during a 30-month period. Patients having experienced standard intubation (two attempts or less) or DI (more than two attempts) were compared. Results: Six hundred and ninety-four patients were included: 70 (11%) were classified as DI and 583 as standard intubations. Logistic regression showed that airways obstruction [odds ratio (OR), 4.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.71-14.4], intubation on the floor (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.04-6.6), and a hyoid-mental distance less than three fingers (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.7) were independent predictors of DI. Immediate complications occurred in 89 patients (16%): 66 (11%) in the standard intubation group and 23 (31%) in the DI group (P<0.01). Conclusion: For prehospital orotracheal intubation, independent risk factors of DI are a mental-thyroid distance less than three fingers, a patient on the floor, and a superior airways obstruction. Anticipation of DI could result in fewer attempts, and fewer complications, as the rate of complication increases with the difficulty of intubation.",1,1
12180585,The Shikani Seeing Stylet for difficult intubation in children: initial experience,"The Shikani Seeing Stylet is a recently introduced reusable intubating stylet, produced in adult and paediatric versions. It combines features of a fibreoptic bronchoscope and a lightwand. Inside a malleable stainless steel sheath, the Shikani Seeing Stylet has a fibreoptic cable leading to a distal light source and high-resolution lens. In use, the stylet is placed in the lumen of the selected endotracheal tube and the light source enables the stylet to be used as a lightwand, while the fibreoptic capability enables visualization of the laryngeal inlet. It is portable, relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain. This report describes the use of the stylet on eight occasions in seven children, all of whom were assessed preoperatively as being potentially difficult to intubate. Three had been difficult to intubate previously. All were anaesthetized using inhalational anaesthesia. Once an adequate depth of anaesthesia had been achieved, conventional direct laryngoscopy was performed and identified as Grade 3 in six of the patients and Grade 1 in one. Tracheal intubation was then attempted using the Shikani Seeing Stylet. On six of the eight occasions the attempt was made by different anaesthetists, none of whom had any prior clinical experience with the stylet. There were seven successful intubations and one failure in a patient who could not be intubated by any method. The Shikani Seeing Stylet seems a useful device for use in children with difficult airway problems, suspected cervical spine instability or limited mouth-opening.",0,0
8214537,[Use of the laryngeal mask in difficult intubation],"Although the incidence of difficult airway is very low, involving less than 1% of all patients, failed air-way management is the main cause of mortality or serious morbidity during anaesthesia. Successful management of a difficult airway starts with recognition of the potential problem. A careful preoperative history and clinical examination should elicit obvious problems to allow prediction of a potentially difficult airway. Besides the introduction of different instruments and techniques, the laryngeal mask (LMA) has been suggested to be effective both in when difficult airway is known in advance to be present and after failed intubation. CASE REPORT. The use of the LMA in a patient scheduled for endoscopic resection of a ureteral stone as day surgery is described. The patient presented reduced mobility of the atlanto-occipital joint, temporomandibular ankylosis (mouth opening of 1.9 cm), dislocated teeth, and kyphosis of the thoracic spine. Due to deformation of the spine, the patient was placed in a half-sitting position (30 degrees). Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (1.5 micrograms.kg-1) and propofol (2 mg.kg-1). Although the conditions made it difficult to manage the patient's airway, the LMA was inserted without complications or trauma. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. After 1.5 h of assisted ventilation the LMA was removed when the patient opened his mouth on request. DISCUSSION. Significant advances in the management of the difficult airway have been achieved in recent years. However, avoidable deaths on intubation have been attributed to unexpected difficulties and poorly managed situations. Thus every anaesthetist should be prepared for potential difficulties by training and be able to follow a rational plan of action. If despite all manoeuvres a tracheal tube cannot be passed, a failed intubation drill must be instituted, and if oxygenation is still not possible a failed ventilation drill must be followed. The LMA is a new device developed to provide an airway for anaesthesia. However, since the LMA can be inserted quickly and blind, it can be used as an alternative airway in patients in whom the trachea is difficult to intubate. The lower incidence of post-operative complications than with endotracheal intubation is a further advantage, particularly during anaesthesia for day surgery.",0,0

23141318,Impurity profiling of capreomycin using dual liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry,"The characterization of unknown (UNK) impurities in capreomycin (CMN) using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) has been described. The ion-pair liquid chromatography method coupled to ultraviolet detection (LC-UV) described by Mallampati et al. was used for the separation of CMN from its related substances. As the method uses non-volatile reagents it could not be directly coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) for impurity characterization. So, these UNK impurities were collected and desalted before sending to MS for structural characterization. As no information about the fragmentation of the main components of CMN, except for CMN IB, was available in the literature, they were studied first. Next, the structures of the impurities were deduced by comparing their fragmentation to that of the main components of CMN. Fourteen UNK impurities that were never described before, were (partly) characterized.",0,0
19572855,Stridor is not a scientifically valid outcome measure for assessing airway injury,Since about a decade cuffed intubation is becoming more popular in pediatric anesthesia. Studies supporting cuffed intubation compared cuffed and uncuffed intubation by using stridor as main outcome measure after extubation. No differentiations were made between benign (oedema) and severe (ulceration of mucosa) lesions. Stridor was considered to represent all relevant injuries. Far reaching conclusions for daily practice were drawn from these studies. Pediatric endoscopists and - ENT-surgeons with extensive experience in this field have warned against this opinion because significant injury of the airway is not always accompanied by stridor! The symptom of stridor might develop weeks and months after injury when silent ulcerations of the mucosa retract to significant stenosis. Only endoscopy can evidently detect all airway injuries. Studies describing airway injury by endoscopic control are urgently needed to find the best way of preventing airway injury by intubation.,0,0

17592392,Lingual fat at autopsy,"Objectives/hypothesis: Obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI) has been shown to correlate with incidence and severity of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), but the actual mechanism underlying this relationship has not been defined. Pharyngeal obstruction from posterior displacement of a large, fat laden tongue is one mechanism that may explain this link. The objective of this study is to characterize the fat content within the tongue and then to determine whether tongue weight and percent of fat correlate with BMI and other metrics of obesity. Study design: This is a cross-sectional anatomic study performed at autopsy in 121 consecutive medical examiner cases. Methods: Tongues were harvested, weighed, and sectioned. A standardized photograph was taken of each tongue in the midsagittal plane. The image was imported into ImageJ (NIH) and then digitally analyzed to estimate fat distribution and percent within the tongue. The measurements were divided into age and sex subsets and then examined for correlation with height, weight, BMI, organ weight, and abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness. Results: This study includes data from 88 males, 27 females, and 6 children. The average tongue weight for males was 99 g, range 71 to 143 g; for females, 79 g, range 51 to 135 g; and for children, (mean age 4 yr) 38 g, range 15 to 81 g. Tongue weight correlated with BMI (r = 0.6, P < .0001). Percent of fat in the posterior tongue averaged 30 +/- 12% and correlated with BMI (r = 0.5, P < .0001) for both men and women. Percent of fat in the anterior tongue averaged 10 +/- 5% and correlated with BMI for males (P < .001). Anterior tongue fat percent did not correlate with BMI in females. Conclusion: Increase in tongue weight and percentage of fat, and therefore tongue volume, may explain why patients with weight gain have higher rates of SDB. Tongue weight, fat, and volume may also correlate with and explain Mallampati grades.",0,0
25999001,Assessment before airway management,"It is wise to plan and prepare for the unexpected difficult airway. Although it is essential to take a history and examine every patient prior to airway management, preoperative anticipation of a difficult airway occurs in only 50% of patients subsequently found to have a difficult airway. Bedside screening tests lack accuracy. The modified Mallampati test and the measurement of thyromental distance are unreliable for prediction of difficult tracheal intubation. Knowledge of risk factors for various airway management techniques may help when devising an airway management plan.",0,0
12500514,Ratio of patient's height to thyromental distance improves prediction of difficult laryngoscopy,"Several tests have been proposed to predict difficult laryngoscopy or intubation. The thyromental distance (TMD) is often used for these purposes but this measurement, used alone, is unreliable. This study tested the hypothesis that the ratio of the patient's height to TMD (ratio of height to TMD = RHTMD) would improve the accuracy of predicting difficult laryngoscopy compared with TMD alone. Two hundred and seventy patients were evaluated preoperatively using the TMD and RHTMD. The two tests were compared analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Difficult laryngoscopy occurred in 16 patients (5.9%). The AUC of RHTMD was significantly greater (P < 0.007) when compared to TMD, indicating a more accurate prediction by the RHTMD. A ratio of 25 for the RHTMD was found to be the optimal cut-off value to predict difficult laryngoscopy. When the sensitivity of both tests was 0.81, the RHTMD had a significantly greater specificity (0.91) than the TMD (0.73). Based on our results, we recommend that the RHTMD should be used instead of the TMD.",0,0
16938152,A comparison of the use of Trachlight and Eschmann multiple-use introducer in simulated difficult intubation,"Background and objective: The Eschmann multiple-use introducer is widely used in the management of difficult intubations. Transillumination of the neck is less commonly used. We conducted a randomized crossover study comparing the Trachlight lightwand and Eschmann multiple-use introducer in simulated difficult intubation. Methods: Sixty-four healthy patients were studied using a standard anaesthetic and full muscle relaxation assessed by train of four. A Macintosh laryngoscope was then inserted and then lowered to simulate a Grade 3 view. Tracheal placement was attempted with both Trachlight lightwand and Eschmann multiple-use introducer in a randomized order. Anaesthetists placing the devices had extensive experience with the Eschmann multiple-use introducer, but only 15 previous uses of the Trachlight. Success rates and time for tracheal placement were recorded. Results: The Eschmann multiple-use introducer and Trachlight were successfully placed in 96.8% and 93.7%, respectively (n.s.). Mean (SD) time to intubation for Eschmann multiple-use introducer and Trachlight were 15(6) and *21(13), respectively (*P < 0.001). Conclusion: The Trachlight is a potentially useful alternative to the Eschmann multiple-use introducer in difficult intubation.",0,0

16244029,The predictive value of the height ratio and thyromental distance: four predictive tests for difficult laryngoscopy,"Preoperative evaluation of anatomical landmarks and clinical factors help identify potentially difficult laryngoscopies; however, predictive reliability is unclear. Because the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD) has a demonstrably better predictive value than the thyromental distance (TMD), we evaluated the predictive value and odds ratios of RHTMD versus mouth opening, TMD, neck movement, and oropharyngeal view (modified Mallampati). We collected data on 550 consecutive patients scheduled for elective-surgery general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation and then assessed all five factors before surgery. An experienced anesthesiologist, not apprised of the recorded preoperative airway assessment, performed the laryngoscopy and grading (as per Cormack and Lehane's classification). Difficult laryngoscopy (Grade 3 or 4) occurred in 69 patients (12.5%). RHTMD had a higher sensitivity, positive predictive value, and fewer false negatives than the other variables tested. In the multivariate analysis, three criteria were found independent for difficult laryngoscopy (neck movement < or =80 degrees; Mallampati Class 3 or 4, and RHTMD > or =23.5). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of the RHTMD, Mallampati class, and neck movement were 6.72 (3.29-13.72), 2.96 (1.63-5.35), and 2.73 (1.14-6.51), respectively.

The aim of the present study was to compare the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx from thefollowing preoperative airway predictive indices, in isolation and combination: Neck circumference to thyromental distance (NC/TMD), neck circumference (NC), modified Mallampatitest (MMT), the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD), and the upper-lip-bite test (ULBT). Materials and methods: We collected data on657 consecutive patients scheduled for elective caesarean delivery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation and then evaluated all five factors before caesarean. An experienced anesthesiologist, not informed of the recorded preoperative airway evaluation, performed the laryngoscopy and grading (as per Cormack and Lehane's classification). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Results: Difficult laryngoscopy (Grade 3 or 4) occurred in 53 (8.06%) patients. There were significant differences in thyromental distance (TMD), RHTMD, NC, and NC/TMD between difficult visualization of larynx and easy visualization of larynx patients (P < 0.05). The main end-point area under curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) was lower for MMT (AUC = 0.497; 95% Confidence Interval = CI,0.045-0.536) and ULBT (AUC = 0.500, 95% CI, 0.461-0.539) compared to RHTMD, NC, TMD, and NC/TMD score ([AUC = 0.627, 95% CI, 0.589-0.664], [AUC = 0.691; 95% CI, 0.654-0.726], [AUC = 0.606; 95% CI, 0.567-0.643], [AUC = 0.689;95% CI, 0.625-0.724], respectively), and the differences of six ROC curves were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

8807170,Transverse forces exerted on the maxillary incisors during laryngoscopy,"Purpose: In this study the effect of level of experience of the intubator on the forces applied by the Macintosh laryngoscope on the maxillary incisors in both the axial and transverse direction were investigated. Methods: Five groups of different levels of experience (15 per group), staff anaesthetists, residents, nurse anaesthetists, surgeons and students, performed one laryngoscopy and subsequent intubation on an intubation manikin equipped with sensors to measure these forces. Results: Maximal transverse forces oriented toward the base of the skull (Fmtpmax) were between 0 and 10 N in 46 cases (61%), between 10 and 20 N in 21 (28%) and > or = 20 N (maximum 46.5 N) in eight cases (11%). The maximal values of the transverse forces oriented toward the intubator (Fmtnmax) were between 0 and 10 N in 69 cases (92%), between 10 and 20 N in 3 (4%) and > or = 20 N (maximum 36.4 N) in 3 (4%). Level of experience was related to Fmtpmax (Spearman: P = 0.04, r = 0.24). In addition, Fmtnmax was less in experienced intubators (anaesthetist and residents) than in inexperienced intubators (all other groups) (Student's t test: P = 0.04). Conclusion: In contrast to the effect on forces exerted in the axial direction, experience proved to have a beneficial effect on the forces in the transverse direction.",0,0
10730735,Sevoflurane mask anesthesia for urgent tracheostomy in an uncooperative trauma patient with a difficult airway,"Purpose: Proper care of the trauma patient often includes tracheal intubation to insure adequate ventilation and oxygenation, protect the airway from aspiration, and facilitate surgery. Airway management can be particularly complex when there are facial bone fractures, head injury and cervical spine instability. Clinical features: A 29-yr-old intoxicated woman suffered a motor vehicle accident. Injuries consisted of multiple abrasions to her head, forehead, and face, right temporal lobe hemorrhage, and complex mandibular fractures with displacement. Mouth opening was <10 mm. Blood pressure was 106/71 mm Hg, pulse 109, respirations 18, temperature 37.3 degrees C, SpO2 100%. Chest and pelvic radiographs were normal and the there was increased anterior angulation of C4-C5 on the cervical spine film. Drug screen was positive for cocaine and alcohol. The initial plan was to perform awake tracheostomy with local anesthesia. However, the patient was uncooperative despite sedation and infiltration of local anesthesia. Sevoflurane, 1%, inspired in oxygen 100%, was administered via face mask. The concentration of sevoflurane was gradually increased to 4%, and loss of consciousness occurred within one minute. The patient breathed spontaneously and required gentle chin lift and jaw thrust. A cuffed tracheostomy tube was surgically inserted without complication. Blood gas showed pH 7.40, PCO2 35 mm Hg, PO2 396 mm Hg, hematocrit 33.6%. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was negative. Pulmonary aspiration did not occur. Oxygenation and ventilation were maintained throughout the procedure. Conclusion: Continuous mask ventilation with sevoflurane is an appropriate technique when confronted with an uncooperative trauma patient with a difficult airway.",0,0
7968338,Predicting difficult laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation: an approach to airway assessment,"Tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy is an essential skill for physicians working in the operating room, emergency room or intensive care unit settings. While tracheal intubation can usually be accomplished with ease by direct laryngoscopy, it is sometimes difficult or impossible because of coexisting disease or abnormal physical features. When recognized before attempts at tracheal intubation, virtually all difficult airways can be secured by the selected use of specialized tracheal intubation techniques, although many of these methods require special training, experience, assistance and equipment. When a difficult airway is unrecognized before attempts at intubation the results can be catastrophic because the personnel and equipment necessary for utilizing the specialized tracheal intubation techniques may not be immediately available and the patient's spontaneous respiratory efforts may have been eliminated by anesthetics or muscle relaxants. Thus, identifying patients who are likely to harbor an airway that cannot reliably be secured by simple direct laryngoscopy is an important skill for all acute or critical care physicians. There is an extensive research data base describing historical information, physical examination findings and radiographic features that are associated with the difficult airway. Reviewed collectively, one of the most important underlying concepts suggested by this body of research literature is that the difficult airway is a product of many anatomic and pathologic variables. A surprisingly wide variety of historical, physical examination and radiographic features associated with difficult direct laryngoscopy have been described. A rational approach to airway assessment, therefore, naturally includes a detailed history, a careful physical examination and inspection of relevant x-rays whenever time permits. As outlined in Table 5, there are specific questions to address that may warn the physician about possible airway difficulty. A number of airway assessment schemes based on physical examination findings have been proposed and tested. These schemes vary in their complexity and their clinical convenience. The simpler schemes fail to address the multifactorial nature of the problem, while the more complex systems are clinically impractical. Schemes combining the distance of the thyromental space and the visibility of the oropharyngeal structures, such as that proposed by Frerk, are perhaps the most practical and reliable of the methods proposed to date. Clearly, no one scheme is ideal. At present, preintubation airway evaluation remains a poorly quantified gestalt estimate of the chances for difficulty based on a complex juxtaposition of historical information and physical findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,0
24122033,Airway management in obese patient,"Oxygenation maintenance is the cornerstone of airway management in the obese patient related to anatomic and pathophysiologic issues. Difficult mask ventilation (DMV) risk is increased in obese patients according recognized predictors (Body Mass Index [BMI]>26 kg/m2, age >55 years, jaw protrusion severely limited, lack of teeth, snoring, beard, Mallampati class III or IV) and should systematically search. Difficult tracheal intubation (DTI) risk may be increased and risk should be assessed in a careful manner. Increased neck circumference and high BMI (>35 kg/m2) should be added to ""standard"" preoperative airway assessment including:Mallampati class, mouth opening and thyromental distance. In obese patients, preoxygenation is mandatory by 25° head-up position achieving better gas exchange than in supine position. In addition, to prevent early arterial oxygen desaturation related to a reduced functional residual capacity (FRC), atelectasis formation during anesthetic induction and after tracheal intubation, non invasive positive pressure ventilation and application of PEEP throughout this period are recommended. Airway management in obese patients has to consider: the anesthesia technique with maintenance or not of spontaneous ventilation, the available oxygenation technique in case of anticipated DMV, and the appropriate tracheal intubation technique (fiberoptic intubation technique or videolaryngoscope) according to the patient status and will. In unexpected difficult airway, the very first priority is oxygenation and a predefined strategy has to be implemented with oxygenation devices first (supraglottic devices or ILMA). Lastly, the final step of the obese airway management is tracheal extubation and recovery. A strategy with a fully awake patient, without residual paralysis, and a 25° head-up position is mandatory.",0,0
25810998,"Prediction of ease of laryngoscopy and intubation-role of upper lip bite test, modified mallampati classification, and thyromental distance in various combination","Background: The incidence of difficult intubation in patients undergoing general anaesthesia is estimated to be approximately 1-18% whereas that of failure to intubate is 0.05-0.35%.1,2,3 Various methods have been used for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy. Although, upper lip bite has been shown to be a promising test in its introductory article, repeated validation in various populations is required for any test to be accepted as a routine test. We have compared upper lip bite test (ULBT), modified Mallampati test (MMC) and thyromental distance (TMD) individually and in various combinations to verify which of these predictor tests are significantly associated with difficult glottic exposure. Methods: After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval, 402 ASA I and II adult patients undergoing elective surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation were included. All the three test were performed in all the patients preoperatively and their glottic exposure was recorded by Cormack-Lehane classification during intubation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were used for comparison. Results: In our study, the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was 11.4% and failure to intubate 0.49%. None of the three are a suitable predictive test when used alone. Combination of tests added incremental diagnostic value. Conclusion: We conclude that all three screening tests for difficult intubation have only poor to moderate discriminative power when used alone. Combinations of individual tests add some incremental diagnostic value.",1,1
16766968,Direct transport within an organized state trauma system reduces mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury,"Background: Prehospital management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and trauma system development and organization are aspects of TBI care that have the potential to significantly impact patient outcome. This multi-center study was conducted to explore the effect of prehospital management decisions on early mortality after severe TBI. Methods: This report is based on 1449 patients with severe TBI (GCS<9) treated at 22 trauma centers enrolled in a New York State quality improvement (QI) program between 2000 and 2004. The prehospital data collected on these patients include time of injury, time of arrival to the trauma center, mode of transport, type of EMS provider, direct or indirect transport, blood pressure and pulse oximetry values, GCS score, pupillary assessment, and airway management procedures. Results: After exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 1,123 patients were eligible for analysis. The majority of patients were male (75%) with a mean age of 36 years. After controlling for arterial hypotension, age, pupillary status, and initial GCS score, direct transport was found to result in significantly lower mortality than indirect transport. Transport mode, time to admission, and prehospital intubation were not found to be related to 2-week mortality. Conclusions: The present study provides class II evidence that demonstrates a 50% increase in mortality associated with indirect transfer of TBI patients. Patients with severe TBI should be transported directly to a Level I or Level II trauma center with capabilities as delineated in the Guidelines for the Prehospital Management of Traumatic Brain Injury, even if this center may not be the closest hospital.",0,0
20072692,Initial adherence to autotitrating positive airway pressure therapy: influence of upper airway narrowing,"Objectives: There is still debate concerning the reason for the high initial failure rate of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment. The objective of this study is to investigate the factors of the initial adherence to PAP, with an emphasis on the role of upper airway narrowing. Methods: The patients were divided into two groups according to the continuation of therapy within the first three months of treatment. The demographic and polysomnographic findings, the minimal nasal cross sectional area (MCA), the degree of palatine tonsilar hypertrophy (PTH) and the modified Mallampati grade of the oropharynx inlet (Orophx) were compared between the study groups. Results: Among 36 patients, 23 continued the auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP) therapy (the adherent group) and 13 discontinued APAP within three months (the non-adherent group). The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly higher in the adherent group than in the non-adherent group (P<0.001). The AHI distributions of the two groups are extremely different. Thirteen of the 23 patients in the adherent group had an AHI of more than 60/hr, while none of the patients in the non-adherent group had an AHI of more than 60/hr. In the patients with an AHI from 15 to 60/hr, the MCA at the wide side of the nasal cavity and the sum of the MCAs of both sides were significantly larger in the adherent group than those values in the non-adherent group (P=0.004). The PTH and the Orophx were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: AHI is a definite significant factor of adherence to APAP therapy. The dimension of the nasal cavity has an influence on initial APAP adherence in the patients who have a not too high level of AHI.",0,0
1539823,Force applied during tracheal intubation,"This study quantitated the force applied during tracheal intubation to determine (a) whether the force differed among novice and experienced intubators, and (b) whether the force required differed when intubating patients' tracheas versus intubating the trachea of a commonly used training mannequin. We studied 27 tracheal intubations performed by 17 experienced (greater than 100 prior intubations) and 10 novice (less than 10 prior intubations) intubators. Each intubation was performed with a No. 3 Macintosh blade instrumented with strain gauges to determine force applied in the sagittal plane. The mean force applied was 24.6 +/- 2.9 N (mean +/- SEM) and the maximum force applied by each intubator was 47.6 +/- 3.8 N. There was no difference between groups in the mean force applied (28.8 +/- 6.1 N for the novice group vs 22.3 +/- 2.7 N for the experienced group, P = 0.27) nor in the maximum force applied (55.1 +/- 6.5 N for the novice group vs 43.2 +/- 4.7 N for the experienced group, P = 0.08). The only difference was in the impulse (force x duration), which was more for the novice group largely because of the longer average duration of intubation (40 +/- 12 s vs 19 +/- 4 s, P = 0.06). Among experienced intubators, we found that applied force correlated with patient weight and Mallampati class. Intubation of the Laerdal Airway Management Trainer required mean forces comparable to those required in patients (26.6 +/- 2.5 N vs 22.3 +/- 2.9 N), although the maximum force applied during the intubation effort was greater (58.3 +/- 4.7 N vs 43.2 +/- 4.7 N, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
9754506,Assessment of airway visualization: validation of the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) scale,"Objective: Research defining optimal methods of intubation has been limited by the lack of a validated outcome measure to assess airway visualization. The objective of this study was to develop a reliable scale for the assessment of airway visualization during endotracheal intubation. Methods: This prospective study was performed to assess the intra- and interphysician reliabilities of emergency physicians (EPs) for estimating the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) that is visualized during direct laryngoscopy. Using video images of laryngeal views obtained from a commercially available videotape, still slide images were prepared representing glottic openings ranging from 0% to 100%. Five EPs, blinded to study objective, reviewed 25 pairs of airway slides (50 slides total). For each slide, the physicians recorded the POGO and their scores using a modified Cormack-Lehane (MCL) scale, where grade I is a view of the full glottic opening, MCL grade II is a partial view of the glottic opening, and MCL grade III is a view of the epiglottis only. Inter- and intraphysician reliabilities were assessed using the kappa statistic (K) for MCL grade and intraclass correlation coefficient for the POGO scores. Results: For the POGO score, the degree of intrarater reliability was very good, with an intraphysician correlation of 0.85 and an interphysician correlation of 0.74. For the MCL score, the intraphysician concordance had a K of 0.71, and interphysician concordance was also good, with a kappa of 0.59. Conclusion: Both the modified version of the Cormack-Lehane grading classification and the POGO score have good interphysician and intraphysician reliabilities. Because the POGO score can distinguish patients with large and small degrees of partial glottic visibility, it might provide a better outcome for assessing the difference between various intubation techniques.",0,0
12608437,High Mallampati score and nasal obstruction are associated risk factors for obstructive sleep apnoea,"Induced nasal obstruction can cause obstructive apnoeas in healthy subjects during sleep, but the relationship between nasal resistance measured during wakefulness and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is weak. It was postulated that if the subjects could not breathe through the nose, the oral airway must be used, but if this airway is narrowed as well, then it could precipitate sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Nasal patency, Mallampati score (MS), neck circumference and body mass index were measured in 202 subjects referred to the authors' hospital to undergo a full-night polysomnography for suspicion of SDB. A significant correlation was found between the MS and apnoea/hypopnoea index measured during sleep. However, the relationship between these parameters was only significant in patients with nasal obstruction. The relative risk of having OSAS with a MS of III or IV was 1.95 for the whole group and 2.45 in patients with nasal obstruction. In conclusion, a high Mallampati score represents a predisposing factor for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, especially if it is associated with nasal obstruction. These patients merit special attention from both the sleep physician and the anaesthetist.",0,0
3189744,Criteria for estimating likelihood of difficulty of endotracheal intubation with the Macintosh laryngoscope,"Many anatomical factors in difficult intubation at direct laryngoscopy have been evaluated. Lateral radiographs were taken of nineteen patients in whom tracheal intubation proved particularly difficult, and fourteen patients whose intubation was reasonably straightforward. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to select the best measurements for distinguishing between the difficult and straightforward groups. The variables which together are most reliable in predicting likely difficulty in intubation are reduced atlanto-occipital extension, reduced mandibular space, and lastly, increased antero-posterior thickness of the tongue. A formula and graph have been derived to relate these variables with likelihood of difficulty, and a method has been described of applying this information at the bedside, without using X-ray examination, to estimate the likelihood of difficulty in intubating a new patient. Eighteen months' experience of the application of this clinical evaluation have so far found it reliable.",0,0
9769786,Difficult tracheal intubation in patients with retinoblastoma caused by 13q deficiency,"Anesthetic management of retinoblastoma patients is unremarkable in most cases. Patients are most often babies and laryngoscopic procedures for intubation are usually easy. However, we recently experienced two cases with retinoblastoma with whom tracheal intubation was accomplished with difficulty. We report the two cases with a review of all 5-year records of retinoblastoma (rbl) in our institution. The cases we experienced recently were all patients with rbl with deletion of the long arm of thirteenth chromosome (13q-). In the 5-year review, the incidence of the difficult intubation was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rbl with 13q- (4/11) than in rbl without 13q- (0/147). In our experience macroglossia was noted for the difficulty in the intubation. We assume that some patients with rbl will be cases of difficult intubation even to cannot ventilate-cannot intubate level when the results of their chromosomal analysis show a deletion on the thirteenth chromosome.",0,0
22170871,Pulmonary function and long-term follow-up of children with tracheobronchomalacia,"Background: Primary tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a disease of the large airways. Long-term follow-up studies of TBM patients have not been reported. This study was undertaken to further elicit the natural history of this condition and the presence of concomitant reactive airways disease through clinical profiling and pulmonary function testing. Methods: Twenty-one children diagnosed with TBM by bronchoscopy between 1998 and 2001 in Queensland were recruited in 2008. Parents completed a questionnaire detailing their child's respiratory symptoms over the previous 12 months. Children then undertook pulmonary function and flow-volume loop classification. Mannitol bronchial provocation testing or post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed to assess for the confounding presence of reactive airways disease. Results: Data from 19 children (12 males) were able to be analyzed. The median age was 9.4 (range 7.6-14.3) years. 15 parents indicated their child's symptoms were unresolved. The mean FEV(1) was 81% predicted with 7 <80% predicted. This was significantly lower than the percent predicted population mean (P = 0.0005). Mean FEV(1) /FVC, FEF(25-75) , and PEF were also significantly reduced (P = < 0.0001). Four participants had a classical TBM flow-volume loop on analysis. One of 15 (6.7%) participants recorded a positive test for reactive airways disease. Conclusions: Clinical symptom profiles and pulmonary function indicate persistent functional mechanical abnormalities of the large and small airways in TBM patients, and the absence of reactive airways disease.",0,0
16732082,Short thyromental distance: a predictor of difficult intubation or an indicator for small blade selection?,"Background: Short thyromental distance (TMD; < 5 cm) has been correlated with difficult direct laryngoscopic intubation in adult patients. The authors hypothesized that a smaller Macintosh curved blade (No. 2 MCB) would improve the predicted difficult laryngoscopy in short-TMD patients over that with a standard Macintosh curved blade (No. 3 MCB). Methods: In a preliminary study of 11 consenting adults (7 females and 4 males), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and TMD < or = 5 cm, lateral neck radiographs were recorded during laryngoscopy with a No. 2 and No. 3 MCB in sequential fashion. In a prospective clinical study, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were evaluated in 83 adult patients with TMD < or = 5 cm by randomly assigning them to two groups for the blade used at first intubation. Those who failed intubation with the first blade were switched to the alternate blade. In total 100 laryngoscopies and intubations were performed: the No. 2 MCB (n = 50) and the No. 3 MCB (n = 50). Results: Lateral neck radiographs recorded at the best laryngeal view revealed that the tip of the No. 2 MCB was proximal to the hyoid body with the No. 2 MCB and distal to it with the No. 3 MCB. The intubation distance (C5 to blade tip) on neck radiographs with the No. 2 MCB was significantly greater than it was with the No. 3 MCB for similar anterior jaw displacement. In the clinical study, the laryngoscopic grade with the No. 2 blade was considered easy (median, 2B), better than the grade with the No. 3 MCB (median, 3). When the No. 2 MCB was used, external laryngeal pressure improved the laryngoscopic grade (1, full glottic view) in 46% of patients. In contrast, when the No. 3 MCB was used, pressure improved the grade in only 10% of the patients. Intubation time with the No. 2 MCB was significantly (P < 0.05) less than it was in patients with No. 3 MCB. Overall, 14 patients who failed intubation with the No. 3 MCB were switched to the No. 2 MCB, and intubation was successful with an easy laryngoscopic grade. Three patients who failed intubation with the No. 2 MCB were switched to the No. 3 MCB. Conclusions: The predicted difficult laryngoscopy and intubation with the use of the adult No. 3 MCB in standard adult patients with a TMD < or = 5 cm is significantly easier with use of the smaller No. 2 MCB.",0,1
10447901,Laryngeal mask for difficult intubation in children,"We present a new intubation technique using an oral preformed tracheal tube passed through a laryngeal mask. Six patients (neonate to six months old) with craniofacial malformations of head and neck and scheduled for reconstructive plastic surgery are the basis of this report. An inhalation induction with increasing doses of halothane in oxygen while maintaining spontaneous ventilation was performed. Once an adequate anaesthetic depth was achieved, a direct laryngoscopy was performed. The epiglottis could not be seen in any of the patients. Anaesthesia was deepened in order to insert the laryngeal mask, size 1 or 2, with an oral preformed 3.5 or 4.0 tracheal tube inside it. Correct position of the mask was confirmed by capnography. The preformed tracheal tube was then advanced 1-2 cm. and its position in the trachea verified. The 15 mm connector was then removed, and an adult intubating stylet was attached to the end of the tracheal tube. The laryngeal mask was removed, holding the stylet and tube in place. Once the mask was removed, the stylet was disconnected, and the 15 mm connector reattached. Our experience was that this takes about 20 to 30 s. We recommended this technique in paediatric patients in which a difficult intubation is foreseen.",0,0
9400738,In vivo and in vitro proinflammatory effects of particulate air pollution (PM10),"Epidemiologic studies have reported associations between fine particulate air pollution, especially particles less than 10 mm in diameter (PM10), and the development of exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the mechanism is unknown. We tested our hypothesis that PM10 induces oxidant stress, causing inflammation and injury to airway epithelium. We assessed the effects of intratracheal instillation of PM10 in rat lungs. The influx of inflammatory cells was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Airspace epithelial permeability was assessed as total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in vivo. The oxidant properties of PM10 were determined by their ability to cause changes in reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). We also compared the effects of PM10 with those of fine (CB) and ultrafine (ufCB) carbon black particles. Six hours after intratracheal instillation of PM10, we noted an influx of neutrophils (up to 15% of total BAL cells) in the alveolar space, increased epithelial permeability, an increase in total protein in BALF from 0.39 +/- 0.01 to 0.62 +/- 0.01 mg/ml (mean +/- SEM) and increased lactate dehydrogenase concentrations in BALF. An even greater inflammatory response was observed after intratracheal instillation of ufCB, but not after CB instillation. PM10 had oxidant activity in vivo, as shown by decreased GSH in BALF (from 0.36 +/- 0.05 to 0.25 +/- 0.01 nmol/ml) after instillation. BAL leukocytes from rats treated with PM10 produced greater amounts of nitric oxide, measured as nitrite (control 3.07 +/- 0.33, treated 4.45 +/- 0.23 mM/1 x 10(6) cells) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (control 21.0 +/- 3.1, treated 179.2 +/- 29.4 unit/1 x 10(6) cells) in culture than BAL leukocytes obtained from control animals. These studies provide evidence that PM10 has free radical activity and causes lung inflammation and epithelial injury. These data support our hypothesis concerning the mechanism for the adverse effects of particulate air pollution on patients with airway diseases.",0,0
24641637,Sublingual ultrasound as an assessment method for predicting difficult intubation: a pilot study,"Current methods to assess the airway before tracheal intubation are variable in their ability to predict a difficult airway accurately. We hypothesised that sublingual ultrasound could provide additional information to predict a difficult airway with greater success than current methods. We recruited 110 patients to perform sublingual ultrasound on themselves following brief instruction. Ability to view the hyoid bone on sublingual ultrasound, mouth opening distance, thyromental distance, neck mobility, size of mandible and modified Mallampati classification were recorded and assessed for ability to predict a difficult intubation based on the grade of laryngoscope. Visibility of the hyoid using ultrasound was associated with a laryngoscopic grade of 1-2 (p < 0.0001), and (p < 0.0001) had a positive likelihood ratio of 21.6 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.28. Each of the other methods had considerably lower positive likelihood ratios and lower sensitivity. Our results suggest that sublingual ultrasound is a potential tool for predicting a difficult airway in addition to conventional methods.",0,0
7921472,Swine dust causes intense airways inflammation in healthy subjects,"Fourteen healthy, nonsmoking subjects were exposed to swine dust while weighing pigs for 3 to 5 h in a swine-confinement building. All but one participant was previously unexposed to swine dust. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and blood samples were drawn before and after exposure. Total dust and endotoxins were measured by air sampling in filter cassettes carried in the breathing zone. The air concentration of endotoxins was 0.6 (range, 0.08 to 1.3) micrograms/m3, and of total dust was 13.5 (range, 5.6 to 24.0) mg/m3. The air concentrations of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide were low. The exposure induced fever in three and malaise and drowsiness in six of the subjects. Compared with preexposure values, a 75-fold increase in neutrophilic granulocytes, a two- to threefold increase in mononuclear cells, and a significant increase in eosinophilic granulocytes were observed in the BAL fluid obtained 1 day (approximately 22 h) after exposure (p < 0.01 for all cell types). The fibronectin and albumin concentrations in the BAL fluid significantly increased (p < 0.01 for both). The number of leukocytes in peripheral blood was almost doubled 6 h after exposure and was still significantly elevated after 1 day. Blood concentrations of orosomucoid and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly increased 1 day after exposure. We conclude that exposure to swine dust in a swine-confinement building induces an intense inflammatory reaction in the airways as assessed by BAL. The airway cellular response is characterized by a dramatic increase in neutrophils. The components in the swine dust that cause the reaction are not clear.",0,0
21155338,[Respiratory failure from upper airway collapse following anterior cervical spine surgery],"Objectives: To determine the frequencies of variables that might predispose to upper airway collapse in a series of patients undergoing anterior cervical spine surgery. Patients and methods: Retrospective review of the medical records of 204 patients who underwent anterior cervical spine neurosurgery between 2003 and 2009. We gathered information on perioperative variables that might be related to upper airway collapse, on whether intensive care unit admission was planned or not, and on the moment when obstruction developed. Results: Partial obstruction occurred in 7 cases (3.4%); 4 (1.9%) resolved with tracheal intubation and 3 (1.5%) required emergency tracheostomy. None of the variables were significantly associated with the development of postoperative upper airway obstruction in these patients. Conclusions: Upper airway obstruction after anterior cervical spine surgery is an unforeseen event and the emergency assessment of the airway may not coincide with the assessment of the anesthetist during the preanesthetic visit. This event may constitute an emergency for which preparation times and resources may differ from those available when this complication is foreseen. The problem for the anesthetist is not the impossibility of tracheal intubation but rather the difficulty of ventilating through a facial mask or supraglottic device, possibly with life-threatening consequences.",0,0
11587097,Induced sputum: opening a new window to the lung,"The interest in sputum assessment as a non-invasive technique to retrieve cells and soluble material from the lung has increased and gained momentum during the last decade. As a marker of inflammation in airway diseases, induced sputum (IS) is a particularly promising procedure since it provides specific information on both the cellular and molecular constituents in inflammation. From 1950-1970, sputum cells had been examined on stained smears, with the procedure having been applied in both research and clinical settings. After having been recovered by spontaneous coughing, the cells were used to study lung cancer and respiratory infections and, later on, to diagnose Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients infected with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV). The method was widely improved upon by the induction of sputum with aerosol of hypertonic saline and then extended to become part of the assessment of airway inflammation in bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It was recently shown that IS can be used to study interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and, more specifically, pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis, non-granulomatous ILD and occupational lung diseases. In light of the fact that immunologic and functional bronchopulmonary abnormalities may be present in up to two-thirds of patients with Crohn's disease, we studied the use of IS in this condition as well. This review analyzes the value of IS and its present applications in pulmonary medicine.",0,0
9429039,Limits of laryngeal mask airway in patients after cervical or oral radiotherapy,"Purpose: To test the efficacy of the LMA in patients with previous oral or cervical radiotherapy, without upper airway obstruction. Methods: In nine patients after oral or cervical radiotherapy, efficiency of ventilation was assessed after induction of general anaesthesia and LMA insertion. Fibreoptic examination through the tube was performed to check the position of LMA. Results: In patients who had had oral radiotherapy, all five had limited mouth opening and in two, LMA insertion was difficult but permitted good ventilation. In the four patients who had had cervical radiotherapy, LMA insertion was easy but, in two, the lungs were difficult to ventilate and, in two, the lungs could not be ventilated and orotracheal intubation was required. Conclusion: In patients with limitation of mouth opening after oral radiotherapy, LMA may represent an alternative to tracheal intubation. In patient with cervical sclerosis after radiotherapy; the use of LMA should be avoided.",0,0
22538029,Rotational vs. standard smooth laryngeal mask airway insertion in adults,"Objective: To compare the ease of insertion between rotational laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion and Brain's LMA insertion technique in terms of number of LMA insertion attempts, time duration of LMA insertion and complications: trauma, laryngospasm, and hypoxaemia. Study design: Randomized control study. Place and duration of study: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from September 2006 to May 2007. Methodology: One hundred ASA I and II adults undergoing short elective surgical procedures requiring general anaesthesia with spontaneous breathing were enrolled. Following pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 μg/kg. Patients were randomly assigned into one of the study groups: rotational-(R) and standard-(S). LMA insertion was performed when patients became apnoeic and adequate LMA insertion depth achieved. Successful placement was confirmed by chest expansion, reservoir bag movement and appearance of capnographic tracing in both spontaneously breathing patients and in apnoeic patients with assisted ventilation. Results: Significant differences were not seen in patient's demographics, Mallampati score, ASA status and pre-operative vital signs. Statistically insignificant difference was found for the time duration and number of LMA insertion attempts. The incidence of trauma was significantly noted in standard insertion technique (28%) compared to (6%) in rotational insertion technique (p = 0.003). The hypoxaemia and laryngospasm was not reported among the groups. Conclusion: The rotational technique was practically easy while negotiating the back of mouth and it requires little efforts with lowest complication rate. This technique can be considered in adults when encountering difficulty and repetitive failures with standard LMA insertion technique.",0,0
25359223,The evaluation of brain natriuretic peptide changes and difficult airway predictors during perioperative period of pregnancy,"Aim: Airway changes, difficult ventilation, and intubation are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in pregnancy, but no prospective study has evaluated the relationship between airway changes and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) before and after cesarean section operations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between BNP and airway changes in women undergoing delivery and during the postoperative period. Materials and methods: Included in this prospective study were a total of 35 pregnant females with ASA I physical status who were scheduled for cesarean section under general anesthesia. BNP levels, Mallampati classification, mouth opening, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, and the degree of neck extension were recorded before cesarean section and 24 h after the operation. Laryngeal views were also documented after intubation. Results: Significant differences in BNP levels, Mallampati classification, mouth opening, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, and the degree of neck extension measurements arose between initial measurements and those measurements made 24 h postoperatively. Pre-delivery Mallampati I, II, III, IV scores of 6, 18, 7, 4 had by 24 h after cesarean section changed to 13, 13, 6, 3, respectively (p < 0.05). Initial BNP levels were 7.59 ± 6.30; postoperative levels were 52.39 ± 48.17. In this study we found a correlation between perioperative BNP levels and difficult intubation parameters. Conclusions: Within 24 h postpartum, Mallampati scores changed in 13 patients (30.95 %). Besides the correlation between BNP levels and difficult intubation parameters, we also found significant differences in initial and postoperative BNP values.",0,0
21621989,[Persistent dysphonia showing a laryngeal foreign body in a child],"Introduction: Inhalation of a laryngotracheobronchial foreign body is a common pediatric emergency situation. It is a source of morbidity and even mortality, especially among children under 3 years of age. Case report: A 14-month-old child presented suddenly combining bitonal dysphonia and dyspnea. Given the persistence of symptoms after 1.5 months and the normality of examinations requested by his doctor (pH, cervical ultrasonography, cervical and thoracic radiography), an ENT opinion was sought. An aerodigestive tract endoscopy was carried out in the emergency setting, finding a glottic foreign body associated with subglottic granulomas. The foreign body extraction led to the immediate disappearance of dyspnea. Dysphonia gradually improved under Budesonide aerosols. Conclusion: The lack of penetration syndrome in the interrogation and non specific symptoms may lead to an important diagnosis and treatment delay with dramatic consequences in case of airway foreign body. Endoscopy under general anesthesia must be practiced if there is any doubt for a thorough examination of the airways.",0,0
15562070,Risk factors assessment of the difficult airway: an italian survey of 1956 patients,"Over the last decade, there has been a heightened awareness and an increase in the amount of literature being published on recognition and prediction of the difficult airway. During the preoperative evaluation of the airway, a thorough history and physical specifically related to the airway should be performed. Various measurements of anatomic features and noninvasive clinical tests can be performed to enhance this assessment. In this study we correlated the Mallampati modified score and several other indexes with the laryngoscopic view to identify anatomical and clinical risk factors related to the difficult airway. We prospectively collected data on 1956 consecutive patients scheduled to receive general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation for elective surgery. The Mallampati classification versus the Cormack-Lehane (C-L) linear correlation index was 0.904. A Mallampati Class 3 correlated with a C-L Grade 2 (0.94), whereas a Mallampati Class 4 correlated with a C-L Grade 3 (0.85) and a C-L Grade 4 (0.80). Operator evaluation, performed by a simplified tracheal intubation difficulty scale, showed a linear correlation of 0.96 compared with the C-L groups. Although there is a correlation between oropharyngeal volume and difficult intubation, the Mallampati score by itself is insufficient for predicting difficult endotracheal intubation.",1,1
9691863,Relationship between difficult tracheal intubation and obstructive sleep apnoea,"The upper airway abnormalities predisposing to difficult tracheal intubation may also predispose to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The potential association is important as both conditions increase perioperative risk and patients with a trachea that is difficult to intubate may need assessment for OSA. We determined if patients with difficult intubation are at greater risk of OSA and, if so, whether or not they have characteristic clinical or radiographic upper airway changes. We studied 15 patients in whom the trachea was difficult to intubate and 15 control patients. Each was evaluated clinically (Mallampati score, thyromental distance, neck circumference, head extension), polysomnographically (apnoea-hypoponea index (AHI)) and radiographically (lateral cephalometry). AHI was greater in the difficult intubation group (mean 28.4 (SD 31.7)) compared with controls (5.9 (8.9)) (P < 0.02); eight of 15 patients in the difficult intubation group and two of 15 in the control group had an AHI > 10 (P < 0.03). Difficult intubation, but not OSA, was associated (P < 0.05) with a smaller thyromental distance and mandibular length, and greater soft palate length. Both difficult intubation and OSA were associated (P < 0.05) with a greater Mallampati score, anterior mandibular depth, and smaller mandibular and cervical angles. OSA, but not difficult intubation, was associated (P < 0.05) with increased neck circumference, tongue area and craniocervical angle, and decreased head extension, mandibular ramus length and atlantooccipital distance. We conclude that difficult intubation and OSA are related significantly. They share anatomical features which act to reduce the skeletal confines of the tongue. Patients with OSA may compensate, when awake, by increasing craniocervical angulation, which increases the space between the mandible and cervical spine and elongates the tongue and soft tissues of the neck.",0,1
10912960,Obstetricians' ability to assess the airway,"Objectives: To assess the ability of obstetricians to recognize parturients at risk for difficult intubation and to examine the effect of education in airway examination on that ability. Methods: The airways of 160 parturients were examined by four physicians: one attending and one resident obstetrician, and one attending and one resident anesthesiologist. After each airway examination, the physicians completed questionnaires about possible difficult intubation, use of antepartum consultation, and choice of analgesia early in labor. Results: Instruction in airway examination did not affect obstetricians' ability to assess airways. Compared with the attending anesthesiologist's opinion, the sensitivity and specificity of the attending obstetrician before instruction were 0.59 and 0.82, respectively, and for the obstetric resident, 0.41 and 0.89, respectively. After instruction, the sensitivity and specificity for the obstetric attending physician were 0.60 and 0.83, respectively and for the obstetric resident, 0.50 and 0.87, respectively. In airways judged possible difficult intubations by the obstetricians, instruction did not affect the use of antepartum consultation or early epidural analgesia by the residents. In the obstetric attending physicians there was a significant increase in use of early epidural analgesia. Conclusion: Although instruction in airway examination did not affect obstetricians' ability to predict difficult airways, it did affect treatment of labor analgesia.",0,0
20434113,Application of a double-lumen tube for one-lung ventilation in patients with anticipated difficult airway,"One-lung ventilation (OLV) is essential in some surgical situations. The use of double- lumen tubes (DLTs) can achieve OLV more quickly and more easily than bronchial blockers. The management of a difficult airway is a challenge for anesthesiologists when, at the same time, OLV is needed for a surgical procedure. This report describes the successful application of DLTs in two patients with difficult airways, and who were scheduled for pulmonary decortication. Case 1 already had a permanent tracheostomy, while Case 2 had oral cancer with an extremely limited mouth opening and needed elective tracheostomy for anesthesia. Nasal intubation of Case 2 was done with fiberoptic-guided intubation with the patient awake. OLV was achieved uneventfully after inserting the DLT directly through the tracheostomy in both cases. We also describe the appropriate use of airway devices for OLV, focusing on patients with an anticipated difficult airway.",0,0
22956530,Clinical uses of the Bonfils Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope: a review,"The Bonfils Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope is a rigid, straight fiberoptic device with a 40-degree curved tip, which facilitates targeted intubation. Bonfils, using a retromolar approach to intubate tracheas of children with Pierre Robin syndrome, was first described in 1983. After an initial steep learning curve, the Bonfils becomes a useful device in the management of normal and difficult airways. The advantages lie in its performance as an optical intubating stylet, which allows visualization from the tip of the endotracheal tube during intubation. The slim profile makes it useful in patients with limited mouth opening and cervical spine movement. Unlike the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, its rigid structure improves maneuverability and allows insertion past soft tissue obstructions. Endoscopic orientation of the Bonfils is better than the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, and it is also portable, durable, and simple to set up. The main difficulty experienced by Bonfils users is common to all fiberoptic scopes, limited view due to blood, secretions, fogging, and tissue contact. Additionally, nasal intubation is not possible with the Bonfils, and direct trauma and barotrauma are possible. Although the intubation success rate is high, it is still very much operator dependent. Time to intubation is inferior to conventional laryngoscopy, and its expense may be an issue in some centers. In conclusion, the Bonfils is an effective tool for management of the difficult airway after initial training.",0,0

19468549,[The lateral midfemoral approach to sciatic nerve block as an anesthetic option to trauma: case repor t],"Background and objectives: Both nervous plexus block and isolated peripheral nerve block are uncommon procedures for patients with lower limb trauma or full stomach, prevailing epidural and spinal blocks as the primary indication. This case report describes the choice of sciatic nerve block as the best indication for a patient with full stomach and severe foot trauma. Case report: Male patient, 50 years old, physical status ASA II, moderately obese (BMI = 29.8), hypertensive, bus driver for 29 years with decompressive lumbar laminectomy (L4-L5 e L5-S1) 10 years ago, under antidepressants, who suffered motorcycle accident soon after having eaten. Mallampati test was class III. After excluding several anesthetic techniques, sciatic nerve block was chosen as the best option. Anesthesia was induced with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine and 15 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine, both with epinephrine 1:200 000, resulting in more than 15 hours of analgesia. Conclusions: Lateral midfemoral sciatic nerve block as anesthetic option for foot trauma was based on pre-established criteria, such as the preference for regional anesthesia in patients with full stomach and candidates to urgency limb procedures, postural limitation of patients to perform some techniques, such as spinal procedures, anatomic understanding of somatic limb innervation and the mastering of alternative regional techniques.",0,0
14984864,A comparison of fiberoptic-compatible oral airways,"Fiberoptic-compatible oral airways (FCOAs) combine the simplicity and benefits that traditional oral airways provide, with the advantage of mechanically guiding fiberoptic intubation. This review examines and compares the salient properties of these devices. Of note, the clinician should pay particular attention to the location and depth of the channel. FCOAs, with an anterior channel, may be advantageous for use with difficult intubations arising from an excessively anterior-oriented glottis, whereas a channel with excessive depth may hinder the localization of a glottis which is off-midline. In certain circumstances, channel size will limit tracheal tube size. The intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway (iLMA) is also included in this comparison. Although this device may have an advantage in performing blind intubations, its use, even with a fiberscope, may be limited. This limitation applies to intubations in which mouth opening is restricted, the glottis is off-midline, airway tumors are present, or with the presence of prior cervical radiotherapy. Furthermore, because of its size, the iLMA can potentially cause airway trauma, which could subsequently limit the utility of a fiberscope. In addition, the FCOA can generate greater positive-pressure ventilation, when used with a tight-fitting face mask, than the iLMA. FCOAs offer clinicians the ability to visualize airway anatomy while allowing straightforward access for tracheal intubation.",0,0
26051809,Mechanical ventilation and resuscitation under water: Exploring one of the last undiscovered environments--A pilot study,"Introduction: Airway management, mechanical ventilation and resuscitation can be performed almost everywhere--even in space--but not under water. The present study assessed the technical feasibility of resuscitation under water in a manikin model. Methods: Tracheal intubation was assessed in a hyperbaric chamber filled with water at 20 m of depth using the Pentax AWS S100 video laryngoscope, the Fastrach™ intubating laryngeal mask and the Clarus optical stylet with guidance by a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and without guidance. A closed suction system was used to remove water from the airways. A test lung was ventilated to a maximum depth of 50 m with a modified Oxylator(®) EMX resuscitator with its expiratory port connected either to a demand valve or a diving regulator. Automated chest compressions were performed to a maximum depth of 50 m using the air-driven LUCAS™ 1. Results: The mean cumulative time span for airway management until the activation of the ventilator was 36 s for the Fastrach™, 57 s for the Pentax AWS S100, 53s for the LMA-guided stylet and 43 s for the stylet without LMA guidance. Complete suctioning of the water from the airways was not possible with the suction system used. The Oxylator(®) connected to the demand valve ventilated at 50 m depth with a mean ventilation rate of 6.5 min(-1) vs. 14.7 min(-1) and minute volume of 4.5 l min(-1) vs. 7.6 l min(-1) compared to the surface. The rate of chest compression at 50 m was 228 min(-1) vs. 106 min(-1) compared to surface. The depth of compressions decreased with increasing depth. Conclusion: Airway management under water appears to be feasible in this manikin model. The suction system requires further modification. Mechanical ventilation at depth is possible but modifications of the Oxylator(®) are required to stabilize ventilation rate and administered minute volumes. The LUCAS™ 1 cannot be recommended at major depth.",0,0

26749229,GlideScope Video Laryngoscope for Difficult Intubation in Emergency Patients: a Quasi-Randomized Controlled Trial,"Macintosh direct laryngoscope has been the most widely used device for tracheal intubation. GlideScope video laryngoscope (GVL) has been recently introduced as an alternative device for performing intubation; however, its validity in emergency settings has not been thoroughly evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare Macintosh direct laryngoscope versus GVL for emergency endotracheal intubation. This quasi-randomized clinical trial was performed on 97 patients referred to Imam Reza Hospital whom all needed emergency intubation in 2011. Patients were divided into two groups of the easy airway and difficult airway; intubation was performed for patients with direct laryngoscopy or GVL. Then, the patients were evaluated in terms of demographic characteristics, successful intubation rate and intubation time. Data was analyzed by SPSS software 16. There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics of the patients in both easy airway and difficult airway groups who intubated with direct laryngoscopy and GVL methods (P>0.05). In difficult airway group, a significant difference was found in successful intubation at the first attempt (60.9% vs. 87.5%; P=0.036), overall intubation time (32.7 ± 14.58 vs. 22.5±7.88; P<0.001) and first attempt intubation time (28.43 ± 12.51 vs. 21.48±7.8; P=0.001) between direct laryngoscopy and GVL. These variables were not significantly different between two methods in easy airway group. According to the results, GVL can be a useful alternative to direct laryngoscopy in emergency situations and especially in cases with a difficult airway.",0,0
23139483,Fiberoptic assessment of laryngeal mask airway placement: a comparison of blind insertion and insertion with the use of a laryngoscope,"Background and objectives: This study aims to compare the frequency of ideal anatomic placement of the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) using the traditional blind insertion approach with one where placement was facilitated by the use of a laryngoscope. Laryngeal Mask Airway is a supraglottic device in providing general anaesthesia. Methods: A prospective comparison of 60 patients divided into 2 groups (30 with the blind technique and 30 with the direct technique) were evaluated with 2 airway assessment methods, Wilson and Mallampati. We also considered whether there was a relationship between these criteria and the successful placement into an ideal position. Other variables were considered, including hemodynamics. Five placement visual ordinals were used to grade the LMA position. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between group 1 and group 2 (P=0.279) in terms of Campbell category. There was no statistically significant relation between Wilson airway score or Mallampati class and Campbell category (p=0.633 and 0.239 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in systolic and diastolic BP at 1, 2 and 5 min post insertion between the two groups, but there was a statistically significant difference in 1 and 2 minute post insertion pulse rate (P=0.004). Conclusion: Blind insertion technique is easier and simpler method for insertion of LMA and has a reasonable success during insertion, so it is recommended to be used.",0,0
19690252,"The diagnostic value of the upper lip bite test combined with sternomental distance, thyromental distance, and interincisor distance for prediction of easy laryngoscopy and intubation: a prospective study","Background: Accuracy of upper lip bite test (ULBT) has been compared with the Mallampati classification. In this study, we investigated whether the combination of the ULBT classification with sternomental distance (SMD), thyromental distance (TMD), and interincisor distance (IID) or a composite score can improve the ability to predict easy laryngoscopy and intubation compared with each test alone. Methods: In a prospective study, 380 patients who were scheduled for elective surgery were selected randomly and enrolled in the study. Before inducing anesthesia, the airways were assessed, and ULBT class, SMD, TMD, and IID determined. Laryngoscopic view according to the Cormack and Lehane grading system was determined after induction of anesthesia and Grades 3 and 4 defined as ""difficult intubation."" By using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the best cutoff points of the tests were calculated. Finally, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of these tests and their combinations with the ULBT were calculated. Results: The prevalence of difficult intubation was 5% (n = 19). Class III ULBT, IID <4.5 cm, TMD <6.5 cm, and SMD <13 cm were defined as predictors of difficult intubation. There was no significant difference regarding difficult intubation based on gender (P < 0.05), whereas there were significant differences between the older tests and laryngeal view (P < 0.05, Mc-Nemar test). Specificity and accuracy of the ULBT were significantly higher than TMD, SMD, and IID individually (specificity was 91.69%, 82.27%, 70.64%, and 82.27%, respectively, and accuracy was 91.05%, 71.32%, 81.84%, and 76.58%, respectively). The combination of the ULBT with SMD provided the highest sensitivity. Conclusion: We conclude that the specificity and accuracy of the ULBT is significantly higher than the other tests and is more accurate in airway assessment. However, the ULBT in conjunction with the other tests could more reliably predict easy laryngoscopy or intubation.",1,1
25311949,Indirect videolaryngoscopy using Macintosh blades in patients with non-anticipated difficult airways results in significantly lower forces exerted on teeth relative to classic direct laryngoscopy: a randomized crossover trial,"Background: Videolaryngoscopy has proven advantageous over direct laryngoscopy for a variety of outcome variables, most importantly, making laryngoscopy more successful. We tested whether three videolaryngoscopes (VLS), McGrath® series 5 (Aircraft Medical Ltd, Edinburgh, UK), C-MAC® (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) and GlideScope® Cobalt (Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, USA) exert reduced forces on maxillary incisors and lower teeth, and compared them with a classic Macintosh MAC 3 laryngoscope blade during laryngoscopy. Methods: In this randomized crossover trial, we included 141 patients (ASA I-III) with non-anticipated difficult airways. They were randomly allocated to undergo direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy performed with one of three VLS. Primary outcome was the magnitude of forces applied to the maxillary incisors during laryngoscopy. Secondary outcomes were the frequency with which forces were applied, and the magnitude of forces applied to the lower teeth. Results: Forces applied to the maxillary incisors during direct classic laryngoscopy were on average higher than forces applied during videolaryngoscopy. Among the VLS the average force applied was significantly lower for the C-MAC® as compared to the McGrath® and the GlideScope® VLS. The frequency with which a force was applied to the maxillary incisors was significantly lower for the C-MAC®, compared to the other VLS and classic Macintosh laryngoscope. The number of cases in which force was applied to the lower teeth was smallest for the McGrath VLS. Conclusion: Forces exerted on maxillary incisors are lower using video-assisted Macintosh blade laryngoscopy compared to classic direct laryngoscopy. The number and magnitude of forces applied to maxillary incisors also differ substantially between different VLS.",0,0
10861153,Difficult intubation in acromegalic patients: incidence and predictability,"Background: Previous studies have suggested that the incidence of difficult intubation in acromegalic patients is higher than in normal patients. However, these studies were retrospective and did not include preoperative assessment of the airways. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of difficult intubation and to assess the usefulness of preoperative tests in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Methods: One hundred twenty-eight consenting acromegalic patients requiring general anesthesia and tracheal intubation were studied. Preoperatively, Mallampati classification, thyromental distance, and head and neck movement were determined in each patient. After induction of anesthesia and muscle paralysis, laryngoscopic grade was assessed during direct laryngoscopy; Cormack and Lehane grade III or IV were classified as difficult. The association of individual airway assessment with laryngeal view was evaluated using the Fisher exact test. Predictors of difficult laryngoscopy were evaluated by calculating their sensitivity and specificity. Results: Laryngoscopy was difficult (grade III) in 33 of 128 patients (26%). Application of external laryngeal pressure improved laryngeal visualization to grade II in 20 of these 33 patients. In the remaining 13 patients (10%), intubation was difficult (more than two attempts, blade change, use of gum-elastic bougie). Mallampati classes 3 and 4 were significantly related to laryngoscopy grade III (Fisher exact test, P = 0.001). Conclusions: The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in acromegalic patients is higher than in normal patients. Preoperative Mallampati scores of 3 and 4 were of value in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Nevertheless, even this test will miss a significant number of patients with a difficult airway.",1,1
8425244,Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis: an unusual cause of difficult intubation,"A case is reported in which anterior osteophytes on the cervical vertebra, in combination with a subglottic stenosis, resulted in distortion of the airway and led to unexpected difficulties during intubation. The osteophytes, associated with the syndrome of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) were centred at the midcervical level and resulted in anterior displacement of the larynx with an acute angulation of the trachea just below the larynx. This acute angulation, immediately above an unrecognized subglottic stenosis, rendered it impossible to pass all but the smallest endotracheal tube. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis is an ossifying diathesis leading to bone formation in spinal and extraspinal sites, paravertebral osteophyte formation and ligamentous calcification and ossification. Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament is common, may be discontinuous, and is often more marked in the thoracolumbar spine than elsewhere. However, isolated and predominant cervical spinal involvement may occur. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis occurs primarily in the elderly population and is often associated with the syndromes of osteoarthritis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Difficult intubation resulting from anatomical abnormalities of the cervical spine is rare. Although radiological evaluation may be useful in assessing the airway in patients deemed to be at risk for difficult intubation, it cannot be recommended for screening patient populations on a routine basis because of the cost and anticipated extremely low yield. Careful clinical evaluation of the airway before operation and having an approach to the unexpected difficult intubation are emphasized.",0,0
19128723,Clinical parameters in obstructive sleep apnea: are there any correlations?,"Objective: To assess the correlation between clinical symptoms and examination findings with severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Otorhinolaryngology sleep clinic in a tertiary referral centre. Participants: Consecutive patients referred to the sleep clinic with a suspected diagnosis of OSA. Main outcomes measures: Body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, tonsil size, modified Mallampati index (MMP), Müller manoeuvre, reflux finding score (RFS), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), lowest oxygen saturation, and percentage of rapid eye movement sleep. Results: Eighty patients (14 female, 66 male), with a mean age of 42.9 years (range 22-66), were included in the study. The mean BMI was 27.6 (range 20-39). A correlation was found between ESS score and anteroposterior pharyngeal wall collapse at the level of the soft palate during Müller manoeuvre (r=.3, p=.02). BMI was significantly associated with a history of hypertension (r=.3, p=.01), MMP (r=.3, p=.001), and lateral wall collapse at the level of the soft palate during Müller manoeuvre (r=.4, p=.0001). OSA severity correlated significantly with male gender (p=.02), history of hypertension (r=.5, p<.0001), BMI (r=.2, p=.03), MMP (r=.3, p=.003), and upper airway collapse during Müller manoeuvre. Conclusions: Clinical findings in patients with OSA do correlate with the severity of OSA and polysomnographic findings. The degree of upper airway collapse during Müller manoeuvre does correlate with AHI severity. Accuracy in predicting the presence and severity of OSA allows for greater cost-effectiveness in screening patients prior to polysomnography.",0,0
7700760,Evaluation of airway complications in high-risk preterm infants: application of flexible fiberoptic airway endoscopy,"Objectives: We sought to determine factors that would predict the development of subglottic stenosis (SGS) and tracheomalacia (TM) in preterm infants. The utility of a semiquantitative measurement of airway dimensions was assessed in relation to signs of airway complications. We also sought to determine from a high-risk population of infants those likely to have abnormal findings identified by bronchoscopic examination. Methods: Prospective airway endoscopy was performed for preterm infants who were intubated for 7 days or more or who demonstrated chronic oxygen needs beyond 28 days after birth and 36 weeks postconceptional age. Subjects were 117 preterm (less than 36 weeks' gestation) infants from two level III intensive care nurseries. Endoscopy was used to classify the type and degree of airway injury. Subglottic stenosis was defined subjectively and compared with an objective measurement using subglottic spatial relations described as a trans-subglottic/vocal cord ratio (TSG/VC). Clinical signs and symptoms and other risk factors were evaluated as significant predictors of SGS and TM, identified by bronchoscopy. Results: Moderate or severe airway abnormalities were identified in 32 patients (27.3%); 13 with SGS, 17 with TM, and 2 with both. All but one infant with TSG/VC less than 0.83 had signs and symptoms of airway dysfunction. Variables more commonly found in patients with SGS included greater number of intubations, use of inappropriately large endotracheal tubes, and longer duration of intubation. Higher averaged mean airway pressure during the first week after birth and lower gestational age were clinical features associated with TM. Conclusions: Flexible bronchoscopic evaluation of a high-risk population demonstrated a higher incidence of moderate or severe SGS or TM than previously suspected. Subglottic stenosis and TM appear to have different etiologies based on different factors associated with their development. The TSG/VC ratio correlated well with obstructive symptoms and may represent a means to quantitate clinically subglottic narrowing. Infants with chronic lung disease who have persistently elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide, apnea, or phonation abnormalities are most likely to have airway abnormalities identifiable by bronchoscopy.",0,0
25664151,Comparison between Glidescope and Lightwand for tracheal intubation in patients with a simulated difficult airway,"Background: Although Lightwand and Glidescope have both shown high success rates for intubation, there has been no confirmation as to which device is most effective for difficult endotracheal intubation. We compared the Glidescope and Lightwand devices in terms of duration of intubation and success rate at the first attempt in a simulated difficult airway situation. Methods: Fifty-eight patients were randomized to undergo tracheal intubation with either the Glidescope (Glidescope group, n = 29) or the Lightwand (Lightwand group, n = 29). All patients were fitted with a semi-hard cervical collar in order to simulate a difficult airway, and intubation was attempted with the assigned airway device. The data collected included the rate of successful endotracheal intubation, the number of attempts required, the duration of the intubation, as well as the interincisor distance, hemodynamic variables, and adverse effects. Results: There was no difference between Glidescope group (92.6%) and Lightwand group (96.4%) in terms of success rate for the first attempt at intubation. The duration of successful intubation for the first tracheal intubation attempt was significantly longer in Glidescope group than in Lightwand group (46.9 sec vs 29.5 sec, P = 0.001). All intubations were completed successfully within two intubation attempts. The incidence of hypertension was significantly higher in Glidescope group than in Lightwand group (51.9% vs 17.9%, P = 0.008). Conclusions: In a simulated difficult airway situation, endotracheal intubation using Lightwand yielded a shorter duration of intubation and lower incidence of hypertension than when using Glidescope.",0,0

23330421,Huge multinodular goiter with mid trachea obstruction: indication for fiberoptic intubation,"Goiter or thyromegaly is one of the most common causes of mid tracheal obstruction (external compression or stenosis), which may be associated with difficult larynx visualization and/or difficult airway management, depending on the goiter size, type and ingrowth into the surrounding tissue. Iodine deficiency disorders are still one of the most common causes of goiter in the population of the African continent. These patients with goiter generally present for medical examination at an advanced stage of the disease. Mallampati test, thyromental distance and inter-incisor gap appear to provide the optimal combination for prediction of difficult visualization of the larynx. Video laryngoscopy examination of the subglottic region and inspection of tracheal deviation in the presence of tracheal compression without detected stenosis of the trachea is a standard and preferred technique in comparison with direct laryngoscopy. Intubation can be performed when vocal cords are visualized. The major difficulty on intubation is encountered in only 5.3% of patients with goiter. Large goiter need not always be associated with a higher incidence of difficult endotracheal intubation. Only two predicting factors for difficult airway assessment were identified in these patients: cancerous goiter (especially if compressive signs are present) and Cormack and Lehane grade III/IV. The indication for fiberoptic intubation is tracheal compression or initial tracheal stenosis. Conventional tracheostomy has to be performed in goiter patients with identified tracheomalacia and/or high degree or tracheal stenosis.",0,0
18249002,Airway colonisation and postoperative pulmonary complications after neoadjuvant therapy for oesophageal cancer,"Objective: To evaluate the clinical relevance of preoperative airway colonisation in patients undergoing oesophagectomy for cancer after a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Methods: From 1998 to 2005, 117 patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for advanced stage oesophageal cancer. Among them, 45 non-randomised patients underwent a bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL group) prior to surgery to assess airways colonisation. The remaining patients (n=72) constituted the control group. The two groups were similar with respect to various clinical or pathological characteristics. Results: Thirteen of the 45 BAL patients (28%) had a preoperative bronchial colonisation by either potentially pathogenic micro-organisms (PPMs) (n=7, 16%) or non-potentially pathogenic micro-organisms (n=6, 13%). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was cultured from BAL in four patients. Pre-emptive therapy was administrated in seven patients: four antiviral and three antibiotic prophylaxes. Postoperatively, 14 patients (19%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the control group and three (7%) in the BAL group (p=0.064). The cause of ARDS was attributed to CMV pneumonia in six control group patients on the basis of the results of open lung biopsies (n=3) or BAL cultures (n=3) versus none of the BAL group patients (p=0.08). Timing for extubation was shorter in the BAL group (mean 13+/-3 h) as compared with the control group (mean 19.5+/-14 h; p=0.039). In-hospital mortality was not significantly lower in BAL group patients when compared to that of control group patients (8% vs 12.5%). Conclusions: Airway colonisation by PPMs after neoadjuvant therapy is suggested as a possible cause of postoperative ARDS after oesophagectomy. Pre-emptive treatment of bacterial and viral (CMV) colonisation seems an effective option to prevent postoperative pneumonia.",0,0
8970373,Quantitative videobronchoscopy: a new technique to assess airway caliber,"Quantitative assessment of airway caliber is generally confined to indirect physiologic methods or to radiographic techniques. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy provides a direct view of airways, permitting quantification of airway caliber by image analysis. We investigated the characteristics of a bronchoscopic imaging system, determined its limitations in quantification and the corrections necessary for accurate assessment of image dimension, validated the methodology with airway models, and applied the technique to airways in vivo. The system comprised a bronchoscope, videocamera, videocassette recorder (VCR), computer with a frame grabber, and image-analysis program. Image quantification was affected by two sources of distortion: (1) Distance distortion: a loss of image resolution with increasing distance between the object and bronchoscope, requiring determination of the operational distance range. (2) Radial distortion: a progressive reduction in image size from the center to the periphery of the bronchoscopic field of view (FOV), requiring correction of airway dimension according to airway size and location in FOV. Validation of the methodology with different sized airway models indicated an underestimation of measured diameters, which normalized with distortion correction. We provide an example of quantitative videobronchoscopy with measurements of in vivo airway narrowing due to vagal stimulation in the anesthetized dog. Measurements of airway narrowing made with videobronchoscopy were also compared with those made with high-resolution computer-assisted tomography (HRCT) which suggested that the two technologies provide unique but complementary perspectives on airway dimensions. We conclude that videobronchoscopy and image analysis provide a novel and accurate method for the quantification of airway caliber.",0,0
9611362,[Intubating laryngeal mask],"To improve the success of blind intubation through a laryngeal mask, Dr. A.I.J. Brain constructed the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA), marketed under the name Fastrach. The new construction allows blind intubation with highly flexible endotracheal tubes up to 8 mm ID with cuff (straight Woodbridge type), securing the airway around the intubation process and maintaining most of the characteristics of a standard laryngeal mask airway (SLMA), including contraindications. An additional contraindication is the existence of a Zenker diverticle. Up to now, eight working groups reported a success rate of blind intubation through the ILMA of more than 90% in about 1,200 patients, with a success rate of blind intubation of more than 50% for the first intubation attempt. Ten percent of the patients were difficult to intubate with the same success rate for blind intubation as in normal patients. Reduced mouth opening does not seem to hinder the use of the ILMA in spite of its increased outer diameter of 2 cm, as long as it is possible to enlarge the mouth opening to > 2 cm during anaesthesia. The new ILMA more than doubles the success of blind intubation compared to an SLMA, irrespective of a large variety of intubation difficulties. Correct judgement of endotracheal tube position is mandatory. The ILMA has the potential to be used in patients who are difficult to intubate and to substitute the SLMA in ""cannot ventilate--cannot intubate"" situations. The future will show if the ILMA also will improve emergency airway management by inexperienced personnel, including intubation, as has been shown for the standard laryngeal mask airway in cardiopulmonary resuscitation for ventilation only.",0,0
25610037,Anesthesia and airway management in two cases of apert syndrome: case reports,"Apert syndrome is a type of acrocephalosyndactilia that consists of craniofacial synostosis, midface hypoplasia and syndactyly, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. During anesthesia, difficult intubation and ventilation may be observed because of abnormal airways. In one of our patients, visceral anomalies, such as esophageal stricture and post-strictural dilatation, may cause respiratory problems because of aspiration. The second case was a Mallampati grade 2 with craniofacial synostoses, midface hypoplasia and syndactyly. In the case of apert syndrome, anesthetists must be prepared for intubation difficulties, airway and ventilation problems and even visceral anomalies.",0,0
20420153,[Efficacy of bougie in difficult intubation with the Airway Scope caused by inability to lift the epiglottis directly],"Background: There are some disadvantages of the Airway Scope (AWS), and the most crucial one is that the AWS has only one fixed-size AWS blade. When the blade is too short to reach beneath the epiglottis and to lift it directly, an endotracheal tube hits the epiglottis and cannot be advanced into the glottic aperture even when it is visible. A bougie may solve this difficulty because its angulated tip can be controlled in a desired direction. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of the bougie on this problem. Methods: Forty patients were randomly classified into two groups: intubation with only the AWS, and with the AWS and the bougie. After general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, the AWS blade tip was positioned in the vallecula, the glottis was fully exposed, and intubation using the AWS with or without a bougie was performed. Success rate and time to intubation were compared in both groups. Results: Success rate was 13/20 in intubation with only the AWS and 19/20 in intubation with the AWS and the bougie (P<0.05). Median intubation time was reduced from 48 sec without the bougie to 29 sec with the bougie (P<0.01). Conclusions: Use of the bougie was useful for difficult intubation with the AWS caused by inability to lift the epiglottis directly.",0,0
19304446,[National survey on out-of-hospital difficult intubation management],"Objectives: Difficult intubation rate is higher in the prehospital setting than in the operating room. Goal of this survey was to assess compliance of the French prehospital mobile emergency unit (Smur) to the recent French guidelines for the difficult airway management. Study design: National phone survey. Methods: A phone questionnaire was proposed to one senior emergency physician of all 380 French Smur. Seven questions were asked about intubation devices used, availability of a written difficult intubation algorithm and intubation training of the Smur's physicians. Results: Guidelines of the recent French consensus conference on difficult intubation are only partly followed by the Smur. Only 60% of the Smur perform systematic rapid intubation sequence, plastic laryngoscope blades are used by more than 50% of the Smur and less than 50% of the Smur have a written difficult intubation management algorithm available. The Gum elastic Bougie is available in 58% of the Smur and the intubating laryngeal mask airway in 71%, whereas initial formation for difficult intubation devices used is provided to the emergency physicians in only 58% of the Smur. Conclusion: This survey shows that the French guidelines for the difficult airway management are only partially followed by the French Smur. An effort should be made for a larger diffusion of these guidelines towards the emergency physicians working in the Smur.",0,0
19151052,Effects of tracheal tube orientation on the success of intubation through an intubating laryngeal mask airway: study in Mallampati class 3 or 4 patients,"Background: We evaluated the effects of conventional tracheal tube orientation on success of intubation through an intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) in Mallampati class 3 or 4 patients. Methods: Two hundred adults, ASA I-II, Mallampati class 3 or 4, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled. All the patients were randomly allocated to either normal or reverse group based on the orientation of the tracheal tube as it was initially inserted into the ILMA. Tracheal intubation was considered successful, if proper tracheal positioning was attained within three insertion attempts. chi(2) analysis was used to compare categorical variables. Results: Tracheal intubation through the ILMA was successful in 183 of 200 patients (91.5%): 157 (78.5%) on the first attempt. Seventeen (8.5%) were intubated using direct laryngoscopy. The first-attempt success rate was higher in the reverse than in the normal group (85.0% vs 72.0%, P=0.025), although the overall success rate was similar between the reverse and the normal groups (93.0% vs 90.0%). The incidence of sore throat was comparable in the normal group and the reverse group (22.0% vs 12.0%, NS). Conclusions: Overall, tracheal intubation was successful in 91.5% of patients through an ILMA with a conventional tracheal tube in Mallampati class 3 or 4 patients. The first-attempt success rate was higher in the reverse group compared with the normal group, but the overall success rate was similar between the reverse and the normal groups.",0,0
16235488,"Difficult intubation managed using standard laryngeal mask airway, flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope and wire guided enteral feeding tube","This case report describes an alternative method of achieving trans-oral intubation in a patient with a difficult airway who was apnoeic secondary to the therapeutic administration of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug given to aid laryngoscopy. After attempts to intubate were unsuccessful by means of direct laryngoscopy utilizing various aids including bougies, a standard laryngeal mask airway was used to ventilate the patient and subsequently, with a swivel Y-connector attached in order to maintain PEEP, to aid the passage of a bronchoscope. The flexible guide-wire from an enteral feeding tube was then passed through the suction port of the bronchoscope into the trachea, after which the laryngeal mask airway and bronchoscope were withdrawn. By passing the enteral feeding tube over the guide-wire and then using this as a guide, a cuffed endotracheal tube was inserted into the trachea. The technique described permitted the continuous application of positive airway pressure, which dramatically improved the bronchoscopic view during the crucial step of placing the guide-wire into the trachea. Passing the feeding tube over the guide-wire aided the subsequent passage of the endotracheal tube, by acting as a stiffer and larger diameter guide through the glottis.",0,0
24291169,Anatomical characterisation of the cricothyroid membrane in females of childbearing age using computed tomography,"Background: In the event of failure to secure the airway by conventional means, it may be necessary to perform invasive airway access via the cricothyroid membrane. No studies have addressed anatomy of this structure in the obstetric population. We aimed to review the anatomical variation of this structure in a population of childbearing age. Methods: We searched the radiology database for computed tomography studies of the neck performed in a 13-month period in consecutive patients aged 15-55 years. Studies on 18 females and 22 males were reviewed. Male patients were included for comparison. Data were reconstructed using a high spatial frequency algorithm to optimise spatial resolution. Five parameters were measured: distance from the skin to the membrane, maximum midline height of the membrane in the vertical plane, maximum transverse diameter of the membrane, neck diameter and cartilaginous calcification. Results: The distance (mean range) from skin to the membrane was similar in females and males (16.2 [3-33] vs. 13.9 [3-37] mm, P = 0.42). The vertical height (9.9 [7-17] vs. 11.4 [8-15] mm, P = 0.04) and maximum width of the membrane (14.5 [10-17] mm vs. 12.5 [10-15] mm, P < 0.01) were greater in males. Cartilaginous calcification was low and did not differ between genders. Conclusions: The cricothyroid membrane is not necessarily a superficial structure and consequently may be difficult to palpate. The smallest dimensions of the membrane indicate that smaller than recommended cricothyroidotomy devices may be required in some patients as the external diameter of commercial trocar devices and tracheal tubes may exceed 7 mm.",0,0
11359590,A comparison of four methods for assessing oropharyngeal leak pressure with the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in paediatric patients,Background: This study compares four tests for assessing oropharyngeal leak pressure with the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). We tested the hypothesis that the oropharyngeal leak pressure and interobserver reliability differs between tests. Methods: Eighty paralysed anaesthetized paediatric patients (weight 10-30 kg) were studied with the intracuff pressure set at 60 cmH2O. Four different oropharyngeal leak pressure tests were performed in random order on each patient by two observers blinded to each other's measurements. Test 1 involved detection of an audible noise. Test 2 involved detection of endtidal CO2 in the oral cavity. Test 3 involved observation of the aneroid manometer dial as the pressure increased and noting the airway pressure at which the dial reaches stability. Test 4 involved detection of an audible noise by neck stethoscopy. Results: The mean oropharyngeal leak pressure was 12.5 cmH2O and was similar between tests. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.99 for all tests and was classed as excellent. Conclusions: We conclude that all four tests provide accurate and reliable information about oropharyngeal leak pressure in children.,0,0
19643253,Emerging concepts in airway infantile hemangioma assessment and management,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in airway infantile hemangioma treatment. Study design: Retrospective. Subjects: Airway hemangioma patients, tertiary pediatric hospital. Methods: Data collected included age at diagnosis, evaluation methods, hospitalizations, airway size, and interventions. Patients were divided into group A (1981-1993) and group B (1994-2005) and were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Fisher exact test, and the Student t test. Results: Thirty-two subjects were identified. Nasopharyngoscopy was used more in group B (11/16 [69%]) than group A (4/16 [25%], P=0.032). CT angiography (3/16 [19%]) and laryngeal distractors (11/16 [69%]) were only used in group B; these techniques showed airway hemangiomas to be ""transglottic,"" not just ""subglottic."" Intralesional steroids alone (3/16 [19%]) and primary hemangioma excision (2/16 [13%]) were new treatments used in group B. Frequent direct laryngoscopies (>six) correlated with tracheotomy (5/32 [16%], P=0.015). Presenting age (<2 months) impacted treatment more than airway hemangioma size. Conclusions: New methods of airway infantile hemangioma assessment changed our concept of airway hemangiomas and their primary treatment.",0,0
17477753,Home management of upper airway obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence using a nasopharyngeal airway,"Objective: This unit has reported management of infants with Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) and upper airway obstruction using nasopharyngeal airways and nutritional support until enough growth takes place for the infant to thrive. There was a mean hospital stay of 60 days. This long in-patient stay prompted review of our management protocols and consideration of treatment at home. This paper reports our experience of managing infants with PRS at home using a nasopharyngeal airway and nasogastric feeding tube and reviews whether such management reduces in-patient stay while remaining safe and effective. Design: Retrospective review of cases referred over a 3.5-year period. Comparison is made with the unit's previously published results. Patients: Thirteen PRS infants were referred to the West Midlands Regional Cleft service and required transfer to Birmingham Children's Hospital for specialist assessment and airway control. Interventions: The parents of 12 infants underwent training to manage the airway and feeding tube. Treatment then continued at home. Outcome measures: In-patient episode, rate of weight gain, and complication rate were used. Results: The median hospital stay was 19.5 days compared to 54 days previously. The median rate of weight gain was 34 g/d. There were no complications or readmissions. Conclusion: This series demonstrates the revised management protocol followed has reduced in-patient stays and remained effective, with infants continuing to thrive after discharge home, and has a low complication rate.",0,0
23561716,[Cost analysis comparing single-use (Ambu® aScope™) and conventional reusable fiberoptic flexible scopes for difficult tracheal intubation],"Objective: Recommendations on difficult tracheal intubation constrain each surgical block to have a fiberscope available. Reusable fiberscope presents the problem of availability, the risk of non-conventional infections transmission and the cost. Single-use fiberscopes are presently available (Ambu® aScope™). This medico-economic study aims to assess the cost of using a reusable fiberscope as compared to the single use fiberscope. Study design: Cost minimization analysis. Material: Reusable fiberscope Pentax® FB 15P (Pentax France, Argenteuil) and single-use fiberscope Ambu® aScope™ (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). Method: Minimization-cost analysis conducted between 2006 and 2012. The amortization cost per utilization for two reusable fiberscopes took into account the acquisition and maintenance costs, as well as the costs related to disinfection. The cost of the single use fiberscope was calculated according to its acquisition cost. Results: The total cost of the reusable material was 55,874€ over 6years, corresponding to a unitary cost of 206€ per fiberscopy. During this period, 780 sterilizations were carried out for a total cost of 32,611€. Acquisition and maintenance costs were respectively 18,382€ and 4880€. The cost of the single use fiberscope is of 200€ per fiberscopy. Conclusion: This medico-economic evaluation shows that the utilization cost of single use and reusable fiberscopes are very close. This should be analyzed at the light of some benefits of using single use devices for the difficult tracheal intubation.",0,0
15167176,Is the 'LEMON' method an easily applied emergency airway assessment tool?,"Objective: To assess whether the 'LEMON' method, devised by the developers of the US National Emergency Airway Management Course, is an easily applied airway assessment tool in patients undergoing treatment in the emergency department resuscitation room. Methods: One hundred patients treated in the resuscitation room of a UK teaching hospital between June 2002 and January 2003 were assessed on criteria based on the 'LEMON' method. Results: All seven criteria of the 'Look' section of the method could be adequately assessed. Data for the 'Evaluate' section could not be obtained in 10 patients, with inter-incisor distance being the most problematical item. The 'Mallampatti' score was unavailable in 43 patients, and had to be assessed in the supine position in 32 of the remaining 57 patients. Assessment for airway 'Obstruction' and 'Neck mobility' could be performed in all patients. Conclusion: The 'Look', 'Obstruction' and 'Neck mobility' components of the 'LEMON' method are the easiest to assess in patients undergoing treatment in the emergency department resuscitation room. The 'Evaluate' and 'Mallampatti' components are less easily applied to the population that present to the resuscitation room, and assessment of these is more problematical and prone to inaccuracy. We suggest that the 'LEMON' airway assessment method may not be easily applied in its entirety to unselected resuscitation room patients, and that information on the 'Evaluate' and 'Mallampatti' parameters may not always be available.",0,0
12911355,Use of the bougie in simulated difficult intubation. 1. Comparison of the single-use bougie with the fibrescope,"We studied the success rates for tracheal intubation in 64 healthy patients during simulated grade III laryngoscopy after induction of anaesthesia, using either the single-use bougie or oral flexible intubating fibrescope, both in conjunction with conventional Macintosh laryngoscopy. Patients were randomly allocated to either simulated grade IIIa or grade IIIb laryngoscopy, and also to one of the two study devices. Success rates for tracheal intubation (primary outcome measure) and times taken to achieve intubation (secondary outcome measure) were recorded. For the simulated grade IIIa laryngoscopy group, the fibreoptic scope was more successful than the bougie (16/16 successful intubations vs. 8/16; p = 0.02). For the simulated grade IIIb laryngoscopy group, the fibreoptic scope was also more successful than the bougie (8/16 successful intubations vs. 1/16; p = 0.02), but clearly use of the fibreoptic scope was not as successful as it had been in simulated grade IIIa laryngoscopy (p = 0.04). With either device, median (range) total tracheal intubation times for successful attempts with either grade of laryngoscopy were less than 60 s (19-109) and there were no clinically important differences. We conclude that the fibrescope used in conjunction with Macintosh laryngoscopy is a more reliable method of tracheal intubation than the single-use bougie in both types of grade III laryngoscopy. This finding has implications for the management of patients in whom grade III laryngoscopy is encountered unexpectedly after induction of anaesthesia, and also for the management of patients previously known to have grade III view at laryngoscopy.",0,0

The main symptoms were cardiac insufficiency and chronic bronchitis. Because of the large skull with hypoplastic cervical spine, anomalies of facial bones, larynx and jawbone normal intubation was impossible. We therefore performed intubation during spontaneous breathing under inhalation anesthesia and topical anesthesia of the larynx. After exploratory laryngoscopy a preformed Woodbridge tube was inserted into the trachea blind and by ear during of inspiration. The patient's cardiac insufficiency and chronic bronchitis made a balanced anesthesia with reduced dosage of rapifen and halothane necessary. In spite of the poor general prognosis, after the operation a considerable relief of the patient's suffering was noted, because she was able to breathe freely.",0,0
19720135,Evaluation of EpiDerm full thickness-300 (EFT-300) as an in vitro model for skin irritation: studies on aliphatic hydrocarbons,"The aim of this study was to understand the skin irritation effects of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons (HCs), C9-C16, found jet fuels using in vitro 3-dimensional EpiDerm full thickness-300 (EFT-300) skin cultures. The EFT-300 cultures were treated with 2.5microl of HCs and the culture medium and skin samples were collected at 24 and 48h to measure the release of various inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1alpha, IL-6 and IL-8). To validate the in vitro results, in vivo skin irritation studies were carried out in hairless rats by measuring trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) and erythema following un-occlusive dermal exposure of HCs for 72h. The MTT tissue viability assay results with the EFT-300 tissue show that 2.5microl/tissue ( approximately 4.1microl/cm(2)) of the HCs did not induce any significant changes in the tissue viability for exposure times up to 48h of exposure. Microscopic observation of the EFT-300 cross-sections indicated that there were no obvious changes in the tissue morphology of the samples at 24h, but after 48h of exposure, tridecane, tetradecane and hexadecane produced a slight thickening and disruption of stratum corneum. Dermal exposures of C12-C16 HCs for 24h significantly increased the expression of IL-1alpha in the skin as well as in the culture medium. Similarly, dermal exposure of all HCs for 24h significantly increased the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in the skin as well as in the culture medium in proportion to the HC chain length. As the exposure time increased to 48h, IL-6 concentrations increased 2-fold compared to the IL-6 values at 24h. The in vivo skin irritation data also showed that both TEWL and erythema scores increased with increased HCs chain length (C9-C16). In conclusion, the EFT-300 showed that the skin irritation profile of HCs was in the order of C9C10C11C12<C13 approximately C14 approximately C16 and that the tissue was an excellent in vitro model to predict in vivo irritation and to understand the structural activity relationship of HCs.",0,0

In 76 comatose patients (Glasgow coma score [GCS] < or = 8) who were treated consecutively in an emergency department, the integrity of the cough reflex was not related to GCS. All comatose patients must be treated as if their airway is compromised but even at the lowest coma scores, there are many patients whose airway reflexes are sufficiently intact to make procedures such as endotracheal intubation difficult and dangerous without drugs.

26885138,Central venous catheter malposition in the azygos vein and difficult endotracheal intubation in severe ankylosing spondylitis: a case report,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can be challenging for anesthesiologists because central venous access can be difficult, and the airway can be blocked due to the fixed flexion deformity of the spine. In this case, we attempted central access via the right subclavian vein, but the catheter was repeatedly inserted into the azygos vein, which was confirmed by radiology. After several attempts, the catheter position was corrected at the superior vena cava-atrial junction. Although several useful devices have been developed to address difficult intubation, in this case, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was the only applicable safe alternative because of the patient's extremely severe chin on chest deformity and temporomandibular joint disease. We report a successful awake fiberoptic bronchoscopic intubation in a patient with extremely severe AS and recommend that the catheter placement should be confirmed with radiology to ensure proper positioning for severe AS patients.",0,0
21772680,A randomized controlled study to evaluate and compare Truview blade with Macintosh blade for laryngoscopy and intubation under general anesthesia,"Background: The Truview EVO2™ laryngoscope is a recently introduced device with a unique blade that provides a magnified laryngeal view at 42° anterior reflected view. It facilitates visualization of the glottis without alignment of oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axes. We compared the view obtained at laryngoscopy, intubating conditions and hemodynamic parameters of Truview with Macintosh blade. Materials and methods: In prospective, randomized and controlled manner, 200 patients of ASA I and II of either sex (20-50 years), presenting for surgery requiring tracheal intubation, were assigned to undergo intubation using a Truview or Macintosh laryngoscope. Visualization of the vocal cord, ease of intubation, time taken for intubation, number of attempts, and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated. Results: Truview provided better results for the laryngeal view using Cormack and Lehane grading, particularly in patients with higher airway Mallampati grading (P < 0.05). The time taken for intubation (33.06±5.6 vs. 23.11±57 seconds) was more with Truview than with Macintosh blade (P < 0.01). The Percentage of Glottic Opening (POGO) score was significantly higher (97.26±8) in Truview as that observed with Macintosh blade (83.70±21.5). Hemodynamic parameters increased after tracheal intubation from pre-intubation value (P < 0.05) in both the groups, but they were comparable amongst the groups. No postoperative adverse events were noted. Conclusion: Tracheal intubation using Truview blade provided consistently improved laryngeal view as compared to Macintosh blade without the need to align the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes, with equal attempts for successful intubation and similar changes in hemodynamics. However, the time taken for intubation was more with Truview.",0,0
15923252,Craniofacial profile in Asian and white subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea,"Background: Clinical detection of structural narrowing of the upper airway may facilitate early recognition of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). To determine whether the craniofacial profile predicts the presence of OSA, the upper airway and craniofacial structure of 239 consecutive patients (164 Asian and 75 white subjects) referred to two sleep centres (Hong Kong and Vancouver) were prospectively examined for suspected sleep disordered breathing. Methods: All subjects underwent a history and physical examination with measurements of anthropometric parameters and craniofacial structure including neck circumference, thyromental distance, thyromental angle, and Mallampati oropharyngeal score. OSA was defined as an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of > or = 5/hour on full overnight polysomnography. Results: Discriminant function analysis indicated that the Mallampati score (F = 0.70), thyromental angle (F = 0.60), neck circumference (F = 0.54), body mass index (F = 0.53), and age (F = 0.53) were the best predictors of OSA. After controlling for ethnicity, body mass index and neck circumference, patients with OSA were older, had larger thyromental angles, and higher Mallampati scores than non-apnoeic subjects. These variables remained significantly different between OSA patients and controls across a range of cut-off values of AHI from 5 to 30/hour. Conclusions: A crowded posterior oropharynx and a steep thyromental plane predict OSA across two different ethnic groups and varying degrees of obesity.",0,0
17555609,Prediction of difficult tracheal intubation in Turkish patients: a multi-center methodological study,"Background and objective: Preoperative evaluation is important in the detection of patients at risk for difficult airway management. It is still unclear whether true prediction is possible and which variables should be chosen for evaluation. The aim of this prospective, multi-centre study was to investigate the incidence of difficult intubation, the sensitivity and positive predictive values of clinical screening tests and whether combining two or more of these tests will improve the prediction of difficult intubation in Turkish patients. Methods: Seven study sites from six regions in Turkey participated in this study. One thousand six hundred and seventy-four ASA physical status I-III patients, scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anaesthesia, were included. Results: The incidence of difficult intubation was 4.8% and increased with age (P < 0.05). The incidence of difficult intubation was significantly higher in patients who had a Mallampati III or IV score, a decreased average thyromental and sternomental distance, decreased mouth opening, or decreased protrusion of the mandible (P < 0.05). Mouth opening and Mallampati III-IV were found to be the most sensitive criteria when used alone (43% and 35%, respectively). Combination of tests did not improve these results. Conclusions: There is still no individual test or a combination of tests that predict difficult intubations accurately. Tests with higher specificity despite low positive predictive value are needed.",1,1
12374715,Management choices for the difficult airway by anesthesiologists in Canada,"Purpose: This study assessed difficult airway management, training and equipment availability among Canadian anesthesiologists. Methods: A postal survey of active members of the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society was conducted in 2000. Respondents chose an induction condition and intubation technique for each of ten difficult airway scenarios. Availability of airway devices in their workplaces was assessed. Chi square analyses were used to compare groups. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Eight hundred and thirty-three of 1702 (49%) surveys were returned. Staff comprised 88%, and residents 12%. Fifty-five percent had attended a difficult airway workshop within five years and 30% received mannequin airway training during residency. Direct laryngoscopy (48%) or fibreoptic bronchoscopy (34%) were the preferred techniques for intubation. For laryngeal, subglottic and unstable cervical spine scenarios, awake intubation with fibreoptic bronchoscope was most widely chosen. Asleep intubation with direct laryngoscopy was most commonly selected for trauma scenarios. Availability of difficult airway equipment varied between regions and types of hospital. Cricothyroidotomy equipment and difficult airway carts were not universally available. Conclusions: Our survey assessed current preferences, training and equipment availability for the difficult airway amongst Canadian anesthesiologists. Direct laryngoscopy and fibreoptic bronchoscopy were the preferred technique for intubation despite widespread availability of newer airway equipment. Lack of certain essential airway equipment and difficult airway training should be addressed.",0,0
3281506,[Anesthesia and laser surgery of the laryngo-nasal-ear region],"The applications of lasers in surgery is nowadays a widely used and well appreciated technique. Besides convincing advantages (precision in surgical manipulations, excellent hemostasis, minimal postoperative swelling, rapid healing) laser-unique hazards require particular safety considerations to avoid accidental injuries to patients and medical personnel. For damage of the eyes is the greatest risk in laser surgery goggles designed to the respective wavelength of the specific laser must be worn by everyone in the operation theatre. The patient's eyes are best protected by covering them with water moistened gauze pads. To avoid reflection of the laser beam only instruments with dull surfaces should be used. The proper function of the laser itself has been tested by a well trained surgeon before operation. Especially in microlaryngeal surgery carried out under general anaesthesia, severe complications, e.g. pneumothorax, penetration of large vessels or destruction of the surrounding tissues, may be the result of beam reflection or unskilled use. However, the most serious hazard for the patient-and even that one with the highest incidence (0.4 to 1.5%)-arises from the close neighbourhood of endotracheal tube and laser beam while operating in the larynx or the upper airways. In tests it has been demonstrated that the beams of different lasers penetrate tubes of various materials (silicone, semi- or transparent pvc) to a different extent, often igniting the material. High oxygen and nitrous oxide contents support tube ignition. The inhalation of smoke and toxic pyrolysis products either of tube-material or, possibly, of volatile anaesthetics are followed by serious damage of trachea and lung tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
23330422,Extubation strategy following difficult intubation,"Airway management relates to the period of tracheal intubation, maintenance of endotracheal tube in situ, and finally extubation. Problems related to difficult extubation still pose significant challenge for both anesthesiologists and intensivists. This article reviews current approach to extubation strategy following difficult intubation. Guidelines and algorithm may be helpful in order to ensure safe management of the patient during this delicate period of airway management.",0,0
11601794,Endoscopic assessment of airway function as a predictor of racing performance in Thoroughbred yearlings: 427 cases (1997-2000),"Objective: To compare endoscopic findings of the upper portion of the respiratory tract in Thoroughbred yearlings with their subsequent race records to determine whether subjective assessment of airway function may be used as a predictor of future racing performance. Design: Retrospective study. Animals: 427 Thoroughbred yearlings. Procedures: Endoscopic examination findings were obtained from the medical records and the videoendoscopic repository of the Keeneland 1996 September yearling sales. Racing records were requested for the yearlings through the end of their 4-year-old racing season (1997-2000). Twenty-nine measures of racing performance were correlated with endoscopic findings. Subjective arytenoid cartilage movement grades were determined, using a 4-point grading scale (grade 1 = symmetrical synchronous abduction of the arytenoid cartilages; grade 4 = no substantial movement of the left arytenoid cartilage). Results: Of the 427 Thoroughbred yearlings included in this study, 364 established race records, and 63 did not. Opinions regarding suitability for purchase, meeting conditions of the sale, and the presence of epiglottic abnormalities had no significant association with racing performance. Arytenoid cartilage movement grades were significantly associated with many of the dependent variables. However, palatine abnormalities were not predictive of inferior racing performance. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Thoroughbred yearlings with grade-1 and -2 arytenoid cartilage movements had significantly better racing performance as adults, compared with yearlings with grade-3 arytenoid cartilage movements. In contrast, epiglottic and palatine abnormalities were not predictive of inferior racing performance. Therefore, evaluation of laryngeal function, but not epiglottic or palatine abnormalities, using the 4-point grading system, should be the major factor in developing recommendations for prospective buyers.",0,0
20727637,Optimal degree of mouth opening for laryngeal mask airway function during oral surgery,"Purpose: This study was performed to determine the optimal degree of mouth opening in anesthetized patients requiring laryngeal mask airway (LMA) during oral surgery. Patients and methods: A single, experienced LMA user inserted the LMA in 15 patients who were scheduled for elective oral surgery. Oropharyngeal leak pressure, intracuff pressure, and fiberoptic assessment of the LMA position were sequentially documented in 5 mouth conditions-opening of 1.4 (neutral position), 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm-and any resulting ventilatory difficulties were recorded. Results: Oropharyngeal leak pressure with the mouth open 4 cm (21.8 ± 3.2 cm H(2)O, P = .025) and 5 cm (27.3 ± 7.2 cm H(2)O, P < .001) was significantly higher than in the neutral position (18.1 ± 1.5 cm H(2)O), as was intracuff pressure (neutral position, 60.0 ± 0 cm H(2)O; 4 cm, 72.6 ± 5.1 cm H(2)O [P < .001]; and 5 cm, 86.9 ± 14.4 cm H(2)O [P < .001]). LMA position, observed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, was unchanged by mouth opening, being similar in the 5 mouth conditions (P = .999). In addition, ventilation difficulties (abnormal capnograph curves or inadequate tidal volume) occurred in 2 of 15 patients (13%) and 7 of 15 patients (53%) (P < .001) with the mouth opening of 4 and 5 cm, respectively. Conclusions: This study showed that a mouth opening over 4 cm led to substantial increases in oropharyngeal leak pressure and intracuff pressure of the LMA, warranting caution, because gastric insufflation, sore throat, and ventilation difficulties may occur. A mouth opening of 3 cm achieves acceptable airway conditions for anesthetized patients requiring LMA.",0,0
22822997,Anesthetic considerations for masticatory muscle tendon-aponeurosis hyperplasia: a report of 24 cases,"Masticatory muscle tendon-aponeurosis hyperplasia (MMTAH) is a new disease entity characterized by limited mouth opening due to contracture of the masticatory muscles, resulting from hyperplasia of tendons and aponeuroses. In this case series, we report what methods of airway establishment were conclusively chosen after rapid induction of anesthesia. We had 24 consecutive patients with MMTAH who underwent surgical release of its contracture under general anesthesia. Rapid induction of anesthesia with propofol and rocuronium was chosen for all the cases. In 7 cases, intubation using the Macintosh laryngoscopy was attempted; however, 2 of those cases failed to be intubated on the first attempt. Finally, intubation using the McCoy laryngoscopy or fiber-optic intubation was alternatively used in these 2 cases. In 7 cases, the Trachlight was used. In the remaining 10 cases, fiber-optic intubation was used. Limited mouth opening in patients with MMTAH did not improve with muscular relaxation. ""Square mandible"" has been reported to be one of the clinical features in this disease; however, half of these 24 patients lacked this characteristic, which might affect a definitive diagnosis of this disease for anesthesiologists. An airway problem in patients with MMTAH should not be underestimated, which means that other intubation methods rather than direct laryngoscopy had better be considered.",0,0
21798455,Difficult airway simulator intubation success rates using Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport systems training standards,"Objectives: This study was undertaken to evaluate difficult airway simulator intubation success rates using Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS) initial and maintenance intubation training standards on transport-RN novice intubators over a 1-year period. Methods: Twelve transport nurses were blinded to and randomly assigned five or six of 64 different difficult airway simulator scenarios. Intubation success rates were measured 1 month before training, 1 month after training, and 1 year later, following CAMTS initial and maintenance intubation standards. Outcome measurements included first attempt intubation rate, overall intubation success rate, number of attempts to intubation, time per attempt, time to intubation, and time between attempts. During the study, participants received no additional training or opportunities to intubate. Results: First-attempt intubation rates significantly improved (P 5 .022) from 19% 1 month before training to 36% 1 month after training, but did not significantly change (P > .999) 1 year later following CAMTS maintenance standards (34%). Mean cumulative success rates did not significantly improve after four attempts or after 3.5 minutes. The overall mean time per attempt and time between attempts declined with subsequent intubation attempts. Conclusions: Using initial and maintenance CAMTS standards, simulator difficult airway intubation success rates are low in novice intubators. Our results suggest that one intubation/quarter may be enough to maintain difficult airway intubation success rates. Training significantly improves intubation rates. Little advantage occurs in intubation rates after four attempts or 3.5 minutes.",0,0
26968055,Bedside tests to predict laryngoscopic difficulty in pediatric patients,"Background and objectives: Pediatric airway management is a priority during anesthesia, critical care and emergency medicine. The purpose of this study is to validate bedside tests that predict airway management difficulty in anesthetized children. Methods: Children under 12 years of age were recruited in a cross-sectional study to assess the value of some anthropometric measures as predictors of laryngoscopic difficulty. The patients were divided into three groups by age. Weight, height, neck circumference, BMI (body mass index), inter incisors distance thyromental distance, sternomental distance, frontal plane to chin distance (FPCD) and the Mallampati index were determined and were correlated with the CML (Cormack & Lehane classification). Results: The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy (CML 3 or 4) was 3.58%. Factors that were significantly associated with laryngoscopic difficulty included short inter incisors distance, high FPCD, thyromental distance, sternomental distance and the Mallampati index. The FPCD/weight index exhibited a higher area under the ROC curve than any other variable considered. Conclusions: This study confirms that the FPCD and the FPCD/weight ratio are the most consistent predictors of laryngoscopic difficulty in pediatric patients. For patients over 6 months of age, the IID also correlated with laryngoscopic difficulty. For children who were capable of obeying simple orders, the Mallampati test correlated better with laryngoscopic difficulty than did the Mallampati test with phonation. Our results strongly suggest that skilled professionals should perform airway management in children, especially in patients with a high FPCD or a high FPCD/weight ratio.",0,0
23634565,Ultrasonographic modification of Cormack Lehane classification for pre-anesthetic airway assessment,"Background: The major drawback of Cormack Lehane classification for airway assessment is its dependence on invasive direct laryngoscopy and hence it is inapplicable for pre-anesthetic assessment of airway in patients with no prior history of tracheal intubation. Study objectives: The purpose of the study was to compare and correlate the ultrasound view of the airway and the Cormack Lehane classification of the direct laryngoscopy. METHODS/STUDY PROCEDURES: The present study was conducted on patients scheduled for elective surgery and requiring general anesthesia with direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. In the pre-operative holding area, the following measurements were obtained with the oblique-transverse ultrasound view of the airway: (a) the distance from the epiglottis to the midpoint of the distance between the vocal folds, (b) the depth of the pre-epiglottic space, and (c) the total time taken by the operator to achieve the final ultrasonic image. The data was then compared with the Cormack Lehane classification during direct laryngoscopy in the operating room. Subsequently based on the correlation data, the ultrasonographic modification of Cormack-Lehane Classification was developed. Results: It was observed that there was a correlation of the distance between the epiglottis and the vocal cords (E-VC) with the Cormack Lehane Grading; correlation was strong negative with regression coefficient of -0.966 (95% CI -1.431 to -0.501; p = 0.0001). Subsequently, the correlation of the pre-epiglottis space (Pre-E) with the Cormack Lehane Grading was strong in positive direction with regression coefficient of0.595 (95% CI 0.261 to 0.929; p = 0.0008). Finally the ratio of Pre-E and E-VC distances with the Cormack Lehane Grading had the strongest positive correlation with regression coefficient of 0.495 (95% CI 0.319 to 0.671; p < 0.0001). Based on these statistical calculations and after rearranging the data, we found that prediction of Cormack Lehane (CL) grades can be adequately (67%-68% sensitivity) made by the ratio of Pre-E and E-VC distances (Pre-E/E-VC) {0 < [Pre-E/E-VC] < 1 approximately CL grade 1; 1 < [Pre-E/E-VC] < 2 approximately CL grade 2; and 2 < [Pre-E/E-VC] < 3 approximately CL grade 3}. The average time taken to complete the ultrasound examination of airway in the preoperative area was 31.7 +/- 12.4 seconds. Conclusion: The non-invasive ultrasonographic modification of invasive Cormack Lehane classification for pre-anesthetic airway assessment can supplement the presently available noninvasive modalities of pre-anesthetic airway assessment including the Mallampati Classification.",0,0
16163916,Lateral neck radiography for prediction of difficult orotracheal intubation,"Background and objectives: Failed endotracheal intubation is a principal cause of morbidity and mortality in anesthetized patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of lateral neck radiography in predicting difficult intubation. Methods: In a prospective triple-blind study, 100 patients (aged 18-89 yr), scheduled for elective surgery were randomly selected. Lateral neck X-ray was obtained from each of the patients before operation. Several angles and parameters on the X-ray were proposed to illustrate a relationship with easy or difficult intubation. A radiologist recorded these angles before the operation. An anaesthesiologist also determined the Mallampati score preoperation. At the time of intubation, two other anesthesiologists performed a laryngoscopy and, according to established criteria, identified the patients as easy or difficult intubation. The results were then compared with each other. Results: Fifteen patients were identified as having difficult intubation (laryngoscopy Grades III and IV). Sensitivity and specificity of the Mallampati Class test were 26% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the lateral neck X-ray for three measured angles were 100%. The positive and negative predictive values (NPVs) for those angles were 100% and for Mallampati classification were 100% and 80%, respectively. Conclusions: Compared to the Mallampati Class test, our method of analyzing the lateral X-ray, although not as easy and universally applicable as Mallampati Class test, proved to be a suitable method for predicting difficult intubation.",1,1
16045139,Airway management of patients undergoing oral cancer surgery: a retrospective study,"Objective: This retrospective study aims to describe the airway management and benefits of nasotracheal intubation over tracheostomy in 260 patients with oral cancer undergoing surgery. Methods and results: The medical records of 260 patients undergoing surgery for oral cancer were reviewed for airway management during the perioperative period. Eighteen patients had previous surgery for oral cancer and were scheduled for flap reconstruction, recurrence or other complications. In 28 cases neck movement was restricted and decreased mouth opening was found in 50% of all patients because of a large growth or fixation of tissues of head and neck, oral cavity, pharynx or larynx by tumour, or radiation fibrosis. In 53 patients intubation was undertaken under spontaneous ventilation. In 20 cases the trachea was extubated in the immediate postoperative period. In 220 cases patients were extubated next morning in the intensive care unit. In none of the cases was elective tracheostomy under local anaesthesia performed before surgery for the maintenance of the airway for anaesthesia. Elective tracheostomies were done in 17 cases. Three patients remained intubated for 24-48 h because of a high suspicion of airway obstruction following extubation due to a large pectoralis major flap. These three patients received a tracheostomy because of increased oropharyngeal and laryngeal oedema. In three cases emergency tracheostomies were performed due to upper airway obstruction after extubation and in one case prolonged elective ventilation was required due to severe chest infection. Conclusion: Oral cancer patients have a potentially difficult airway but, if managed properly during perioperative period, morbidity and mortality can be reduced or avoided. Oral cancer patients can be managed safely without the routine use of a tracheostomy. Nasotracheal intubation is a safe alternative to tracheostomy in oral cancer patients except in some selected patients.",0,0
