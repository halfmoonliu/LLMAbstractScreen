25885832,A clinical comparison of ketofol (ketamine and propofol admixture) versus propofol as an induction agent on quality of laryngeal mask airway insertion and hemodynamic stability in children,"Background: In spite of being the preferred induction agent for LMA insertion, propofol has many undesirable side effects including dose-related cardiorespiratory depression and local pain at injection site. Ketofol as a novel induction agent has been introduced recently with comparable efficacy and improved hemodynamic control. Objective: To investigate ketofol as a suitable induction agent alternative to propofol for insertion of LMA in children considering insertion conditions, hemodynamic stability, local pain at injection site, and recovery. Materials and methods: In this randomized, double-blind study, 100 children were randomly assigned into two groups of 50 patients each in which induction was performed with either propofol or ketofol. Providers were given one 20 ml syringe [represent either 2 mg/kg of propofol (P group) or 0.75 mg/kg of ketamine and 1.5 mg/kg of propofol (KP group)] and one 10 ml syringe for rescue if needed [represent 1 mg/kg of propofol (P group) or 0.25 mg/kg of ketamine and 0.5 mg/kg of propofol (KP group)]. After monitoring with bispectral index (BIS), general anesthesia was induced by infusion with a syringe perfuser at a constant rate of 250 ml/h with either of the two agents till the BIS values decreased to 40. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) were measured every 30 seconds up to 5 minutes after LMA placement. The time till BIS values decreased to 40 was measured. All children were evaluated for incidence of apnea, pain on injection, jaw relaxation, conditions for LMA insertion, and complications such as muscle rigidity, hallucinations, and excessive secretions. Results: Induction time (time to reach BIS of 40) was faster in the KP group (150 ± 23.5 seconds) than in the P group (205 ± 37.4 seconds). The incidence of injection pain was significantly lower in the KP group (10%) than in the P group (80%). Excellent jaw relaxation and full mouth opening were higher in the KP group [45 patients (90%)] than in the P group [38 patients (76%)]. Excellent LMA insertion conditions were observed in 45 patients (90%) in the KP group and 38 patients (76%) in the P group. The KP group showed preserved hemodynamic stability (mean blood pressure, heart rate) with less incidence and duration of apnea compared to the P group. Conclusion: ketofol is a safe and effective alternative induction agent for LMA insertion in children with rapid onset of action and lower incidence of injection pain. It provided better LMA insertion conditions, improved hemodynamic stability with less prolonged apnea when compared with propofol.",0,0
17379129,Dexmedetomidine for conscious sedation in difficult awake fiberoptic intubation cases,"Currently used methods of sedation for fiberoptic intubation such as benzodiazepines, propofol, or opioids have their limitations. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has been used clinically for its sympatholytic, analgesic, and sedative properties. We report on 4 patients with particularly difficult airways who underwent successful awake fiberoptic intubation with DEX. Dexmedetomidine was used to provide a moderate level of conscious sedation without causing respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability during fiberoptic intubation.",0,0
23020699,A randomised crossover trial comparing a single-use polyvinyl chloride laryngeal mask airway with a single-use silicone laryngeal mask airway,"We compared insertion rates of single-use polyvinyl chloride laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) vs single-use silicone LMAs in 72 anaesthetised patients. Both airways were produced by Flexicare Medical. Laryngeal mask airway insertion was successful on the first attempt in 68/72 (94%) polyvinyl chloride LMAs vs 64/72 (89%) silicone LMAs (p = 0.39). Overall insertion rates were 72/72 (100%) for the polyvinyl chloride LMAs and 71/72 (99%) for the silicone LMAs (p = 1.0). Mean (SD) insertion times were similar for polyvinyl chloride and silicone LMAs: 24.3 (5.1)s vs 24.8 (7.8)s (p = 0.64). Laryngeal mask airway position, as assessed using a fibrescope, was not different (p = 0.077). The median (IQR [range]) leak pressure was 16 (12-20 [6-30]) cmH(2) O for the polyvinyl LMA and 18 (13-22 [6-30]) cmH(2) O or the silicone LMA (p = 0.037). In conclusion, we did not find any important differences between polyvinyl chloride and silicone laryngeal mask airways.",0,0
15715633,An unusual cause of difficult intubation in a patient with a large cervical anterior osteophyte: a case report,"This report describes a case in which a large anterior osteophyte on the C2 and C3 vertebrae, due to ankylosing spondylitis, resulted in distortion of the anatomy of the upper airway and difficult intubation. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a progressive inflammatory disease, characterized by stiffening of the joints and ligaments. Stiffness of the cervical spine, atlanto-occipital, temporomandibular and cricoarytenoid joints may cause difficult intubation (1). This report describes a case in which a large anterior osteophyte on the C2 and C3 vertebrae, associated with AS, resulted in distortion of the anatomy of the upper airway and difficult intubation.",0,0
17976512,[Invasive papillary carcinoma of the thyroid associated with a voluminous laryngocele],"Objectives: To determine the value of computed tomography scan in the associated laryngeal and thyroid pathology. Material and methods: The giant laryngocele caused acute obstruction of the upper respiratory airway. Clinically, presenting symptoms includes lateral neck mass, dysphagia, cough, dyspnea. A neck CT scan is a special X-ray study that is used to examine structures located in the neck and upper chest. Results: On computed tomography (CT), a mixed (external) laryngocele appears as a well-marginated fluid-filled cystic mass in the lower submandibular space at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane. In this case, computed tomography of the neck showed an associated lesion between the larynx and the invasive thyroid tumor. The laryngocele was treated by extramucous lateral thyrotomy and the carcinoma removed through subtotal thyroidectomy. Conclusions: CT scan demonstrated its great value in the evaluation of the patient with a neck mass.",0,0
26685121,Hybrid selective surface hydrophilization and froth flotation separation of hazardous chlorinated plastics from E-waste with novel nanoscale metallic calcium composite,"Treatment by a nanometallic Ca/CaO composite has been found to selectively hydrophilize the surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), enhancing its wettability and thereby promoting its separation from E-waste plastics by means of froth flotation. The treatment considerably decreased the water contact angle of PVC, by about 18°. The SEM images of the PVC plastic after treatment displayed significant changes in their surface morphology compared to other plastics. The SEM-EDS results reveal that a markedly decrease of [Cl] concentration simultaneously with dramatic increase of [O] on the surface of the PCV samples. XPS results further confirmed an increase of hydrophilic functional groups on the PVC surface. Froth flotation at 100rpm mixing speed was found to be optimal, separating 100% of the PVC into a settled fraction of 96.4% purity even when the plastics fed into the reactor were of nonuniform size and shape. The total recovery of PVC-free plastics in E-waste reached nearly 100% in the floated fraction, significantly improved from the 20.5wt% of light plastics that can be recovered by means of conventional wet gravity separation. The hybrid method of nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment and froth flotation is effective in the separation of hazardous chlorinated plastics from E-waste plastics.",0,0
25664060,A comparison of upper airway parameters in postpartum patients: vaginal delivery vs. caesarean section,"Mallampati class has been shown to increase during labour. The influence of delivery mode on this change is not known yet. The aim of our study is to investigate the changes of upper airway parameters in parturients after caesarean section and vaginal delivery. Ninety parturients undergoing elective caesarean section and ninety parturients with vaginal delivery were enrolled. The parameters of Modified Mallampati test (MMT), inter-incisor distance, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, neck circumference were measured before labour (T0) and 1 h (T1), 6 h (T6) and 24 h (T24) after delivery. Overall, 39 parturients (45.3%) with increases in MMT class in the vaginal delivery group within 24 h After childbirth, were more than that in the caesarean section group [24 parturients (26.7%), P=0.01]. In the vaginal delivery group, the incidence of the increases in MMT class at T1 and T6 were similar, which were higher than that at T24 (P=0.015). In the caesarean section group, the incidence of MMT class increases at T6 was significantly higher than that at T1 (P=0.015) and T24 (P=0.015). Our findings indicate that increase in Mallamapti class may be more significant and may take place earlier in parturients undergoing vaginal delivery than in those undergoing elective caesarean section.",0,0
8030813,"Thyroidectomy in patients with marked thyroid enlargement: airway management, morbidity, and outcome","The medical records of 91 patients who underwent thyroidectomy from 1990 to 1993 were reviewed to evaluate airway management and operative morbidity in patients with marked thyroid enlargement. Twenty-nine patients with marked thyroid enlargement were identified: 13 unilateral, defined by a weight of > or = 40 g (mean 122 g, range 41-380 g), and 16 bilateral, defined by a weight of > or = 80 g (mean 160 g, range 82-404 g). Twenty-five patients had compressive symptomatology, 18 had tracheal narrowing and/or displacement, 19 had substernal extension, and one had superior vena cava syndrome. Unilateral vocal cord dysfunction was present in two of three patients with carcinoma and one of 26 patients with benign disease (P = 0.03). Pathology consisted of nodular goiter (11), adenoma (5), carcinoma (3), Grave's disease (5), and toxic multinodular goiter (5). All patients had an uncomplicated endotracheal intubation without the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope as predicted on the basis of preoperative laryngoscopic findings. Ease of intubation was unrelated to the extent of abnormality seen on imaging studies of the neck. Thyroidectomy alone was effective in relieving compressive symptoms with no incidence of nerve injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism, or tracheomalacia. Six (21%) of 29 patients had temporary hypocalcemia compared to eight (13%) of 62 patients with lesser thyroid enlargement (P = 0.36). One patient with an unresectable follicular carcinoma died from aspiration pneumonia three weeks following tracheostomy placement. Marked thyroid enlargement and upper airway compression is predominantly caused by benign disease; however, when there is associated recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction, carcinoma is more common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
18806036,Gum elastic bougie-guided insertion of the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway is superior to the digital and introducer tool techniques in patients with simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar,"Background: We compared three techniques for insertion of the laryngeal mask airway ProSeal (PLMA) in patients with simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar. Methods: Ninety-nine anesthetized healthy female patients aged 19-68 yr were randomly allocated for PLMA insertion using the digital, introducer tool (IT) or guided techniques. Difficult laryngoscopy was simulated using a rigid neck collar. The laryngoscopic view was graded before PLMA insertion. The digital and IT techniques were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The guided technique involved priming the drain tube with an Eschmann tracheal tube introducer, placing the introducer in the esophagus under direct vision and railroading the PLMA into position. Failed insertion was defined by any of the following criteria: 1) failed pharyngeal placement, 2) malposition, and 3) ineffective ventilation. Results: The median laryngoscopic view was 3 and the mean interincisor distance was 3.3 cm. Insertion was more frequently successful with the guided technique at the first attempt (guided 100%, digital 64%, IT 61%; P<0.0001), but success after three attempts was similar (guided 100%, digital 94%, IT 91%). The time taken for successful placement was similar among groups at the first attempt, but was shorter for the guided technique after three attempts (guided 31+/-8 s, digital 49+/-28 s, IT 54+/-37 s; P<0.02). Conclusion: The guided insertion technique is more frequently successful than the digital or IT techniques in patients with simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar.",0,0
22271280,Analysis of pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy,"Direct laryngoscopy is the most predominantly used technique in laryngology, with the fulcrum-based laryngoscope serving as the most popular instrument. The purpose of this study was to accurately calculate and measure the pressure acting on the laryngopharynx and the tongue base during microlaryngoscopy. The relationship between postoperative throat pain and the time and pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy were also investigated. Fifty patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery were included in this prospective study. Parameters that may help predict difficult laryngeal exposure were measured in the patients before microlaryngoscopy. Using static equilibrium and the law of the lever, the pressure acting on the laryngopharynx and the tongue base were calculated and related parameters were then tested for their influence on pressure. The time and pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy of each patient were compared with postoperative throat pain grade. The mean pressure was 292 ± 109 mmHg and was significantly influenced by BMI, neck circumference and full mouth opening, whereas no gender-based differences of any kind were found. The pressure applied during microlaryngoscopy was extremely high in patients with difficult laryngeal exposure (376 ± 62 mmHg), serving as a possible reason for the presence of throat pain or complications present following surgery. However, it was found that the duration of suspension laryngoscopy, not the pressure, had the most significant correlation with postoperative throat pain.",0,0
10339943,[Pulmonary tumor mass aberration into the bronchus of the intact right lung during total left lung resection],"A 77-year-old male with lung cancer underwent a total left lung resection. During surgery, there was no ventilatory trouble such as hypoventilation or hypoxia. However, a mass was found in the right main bronchus by endobronchial fiberscopy before extubation. Because the mass could not be aspirated through the endobronchial fiberscope, we extracted it using basket-foreceps. We speculated that surgical procedures may have caused the tumor mass to move to the bronchus of the contralateral intact lung. Accordingly, fiberscopic examination of the airway before extubation should be mandatory, even if there is no ventilatory trouble during lung resection.",0,0
17205884,Lightwand-assisted nasotracheal intubation in awake ankylosing spondylitis,"Several techniques of airway management in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been reported. No study related specifically to the use of a lightwand-assisted intubation in AS has been previously described. The present case report demonstrates that an awake, nasotracheal intubation can be successfully performed to provide general anesthesia in a patient with AS. A 65-year-old Thai male was scheduled for exploratory surgery under general anesthesia. Past medical history consisted of hypertension and AS. The preoperative airway assessment showed limitation of mouth opening, an extremely anteriorly flexed and immobile cervical spine. An awake intubation under sedation and topical airway anesthesia were chosen. Multiple attempts at blind nasotracheal intubation and oral approach with lightwand were unsuccessful. Finally, intubation was successfully performed with lightwand by nasal route. This serves to show that an awake nasotracheal intubation with a lightwand may be a safe and useful alternative option for airway management in patients with severe ankylosing spondylitis.",0,0
26279410,Use of rotational angiography in assessing relationship of the airway to vasculature during cardiac catheterization,"Objectives: We are the first to describe the use of three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) in creating multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and volume rendering, in the catheterization suite, of airways at risk for compression by adjacent cardiac structures. Background: 3DRA has emerged as a promising tool for improved visualization of cardiac and vascular structures in congenital heart disease. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all available cases at our institution in which MPR from 3DRA was used to assess airways in relation to surrounding cardiovascular structures. Results: Eight cases were reviewed from January 1, 2011 to November 30, 2013. Seven children had complex biventricular anatomy, including repaired truncus arteriosus, repaired absent pulmonary valve, repaired double outlet right ventricle, and vascular rings. One child had double inlet left ventricle and had undergone a hybrid procedure (stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus and banding of bilateral pulmonary arteries) before the Glenn procedure. Six of these cases involved distortion or stenosis of the pulmonary conduit or branch pulmonary arteries. In all cases, the trachea and the main bronchi were clearly visualized using MPR. Management was affected by the visualization of the airways during the catheterization procedure in seven of eight cases. Four cases had intraprocedural bronchoscopy that confirmed airway findings seen by MPR. In one case, computed tomography confirmed left bronchial compression seen by MPR. Conclusions: 3DRA can visualize airway anatomy and its relationship to the vasculature accurately. This has significant implications for preinterventional planning, intraprocedural management, as well as postprocedural recovery.",0,0

9515844,Preoperative bronchoscopic assessment of airway invasion by esophageal cancer: a prospective study,"Background: Bronchoscopy is frequently used to assess invasion of esophageal cancer into the tracheobronchial tree. Prospective studies evaluating the role of bronchoscopy in pretherapeutic staging of esophageal cancer are lacking. Study objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of fiberoptic bronchoscopy for the assessment of airway involvement by esophageal carcinoma and its resectability. Patients and methods: In a prospective study, we analyzed 150 bronchoscopies in 116 consecutive patients with potentially operable esophageal carcinoma, and correlated the findings with other staging modalities, intraoperative evaluation, and histopathologic data. Results: One unknown additional bronchial cancer was found. In 32% of bronchoscopies performed in patients with esophageal cancer located above the tracheal bifurcation, some macroscopic abnormality was detected in the trachea and main bronchi, with mobile protrusion of the posterior tracheal wall being the most frequent abnormality (20.7%). When compared with histologic results, normal macroscopic appearance of the trachea and main bronchi had a negative predictive value of 98.5%, but the positive predictive value of all macroscopic abnormalities for the diagnosis of airway involvement was low, particularly after radiation therapy. The overall accuracy of bronchoscopy with multiple brush cytology and biopsy sampling in proving or excluding airway invasion in patients with otherwise operable conditions was 95.8% (95% confidence interval, 88.3 to 99.1%). Bronchoscopy was the sole decisive staging procedure, resulting in exclusion from surgery because of airway invasion, in 9.7% of patients with otherwise potentially operable conditions. The results of bronchoscopy and CT were discordant in 40% of the patients; the specificity and positive predictive value were higher for bronchoscopy than for CT. Conclusions: When performed as the last investigation in the staging workup, bronchoscopy with biopsy and brush cytology is a very accurate procedure in evaluating possible airway invasion of esophageal cancer; macroscopic findings alone are not reliable.",0,0
16492835,"Predictive performance of three multivariate difficult tracheal intubation models: a double-blind, case-controlled study","We performed a case-controlled, double-blind study to examine the performance of three multivariate clinical models (Wilson, Arné, and Naguib models) in the prediction of unanticipated difficult intubation. The study group consisted of 97 patients in whom an unanticipated difficult intubation had occurred. For each difficult intubation patient, a matched control patient was selected in whom tracheal intubation had been easily accomplished. Postoperatively, a blinded investigator evaluated both patients. The clinical assessment included the patient's weight, height, age, Mallampati score, interincisor gap, thyromental distance, thyrosternal distance, neck circumference, Wilson risk sum score, history of previous difficult intubation, and diseases associated with difficult laryngoscopy or intubation. The Naguib model was significantly more sensitive (81.4%; P < 0.0001) than the Arné (54.6%) or Wilson (40.2%) models. Both the Naguib (76.8%) and Arné (74.7%) model classified more intubations correctly (P = 0.01) than the Wilson model (66.5%). The specificity of Arné, Wilson, and Naguib model was 94.9%, 92.8%, and 72.2%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87, 0.79, and 0.82, respectively. Our new model for prediction of difficult intubation was developed using logistic regression and includes thyromental distance, Mallampati score, interincisor gap, and height. This model is 82.5% sensitive and 85.6% specific with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90.",1,1
23493414,Comparison of clinical performance of the I-gel with LMA proseal,"Aim: To compare insertion characteristics of 2 different supraglottic devices [I-gel and Proseal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA)] and to observe any associated complications. Study design: This prospective, randomized study was conducted in 80 patients [Group I - I-gel insertion (n = 40) and Group P - LMA Proseal insertion (n =40)] of ASA grades I/II, of either sex in the age group 18-65 years. Both groups were compared with respect to ease of insertion, insertion attempts, fiberoptic assessment, airway sealing pressure, ease of gastric tube placement, and other complications. Materials and methods: All patients were asked to fast overnight. Patients were given alprazolam 0.25 mg orally at 10 p.m. the night before surgery and again 2 hours prior to surgery with 1-2 sips of water. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg, and ranitidine 50 mg were administered intravenously to the patients 45 minutes prior to the surgery. Once adequate depth of anesthesia was achieved either of the 2 devices, selected using a random computerized table, was inserted by an experienced anesthesiologist. In group I, I-gel was inserted and in patients of group P, PLMA was inserted. Statistical analysis: Student t-test and Mann-Whitney test were employed to compare the means; for categorical variables, Chi-square test was used. Result: Mean insertion time for the I-gel (11.12 ± 1.814 sec) was significantly lower than that of the PLMA (15.13 ± 2.91 sec) (P = 0.001). I-gel was easier to insert with a better anatomic fit. Mean airway sealing pressure in the PLMA group (29.55 ± 3.53 cm H2O) was significantly higher than in the I-gel group (26.73 ± 2.52 cm H2O; P = 0.001). Ease of gastric tube insertion was significantly higher in the I-gel group (P = 0.001). Incidence of blood staining of the device, sore throat and dysphagia were observed more in PLMA group. No other complications were observed in either of the groups.",0,0
8793918,Airway management for pediatric emergencies,"Several factors increase the difficulty and urgency of airway management in children in the emergency setting. Early and appropriate airway management are of prime importance in improving the outcome of such patients. The major decision points of airway management include one's assessment of the airway and ability to perform endotracheal intubation. If the airway is judged to be normal, oral endotracheal intubation following sedation and neuromuscular blockade is suggested. Rapid sequence intubation to prevent acid aspiration should be used. While the medications for airway management generally are administered intravenously, it should be kept in mind that intraosseous access is an acceptable alternative for the administration of several different agents, including those used for endotracheal intubation. If the airway cannot be secured following the administration of anesthetic and neuromuscular blocking agents, the ASA algorithm for the ""cannot intubate/cannot ventilate"" scenario should be followed (Figure). When the airway is judged to be abnormal, one of the above described awake techniques may be used. While there is ample literature concerning these techniques in adults, their use in children has been limited. Most importantly, considerable practice may be required to become and stay facile with many of these ""alternative techniques"" of airway management. In certain circumstances, surgical cricothyrotomy should be considered as an alternative to airway management. Regardless of the technique chosen, appropriate personnel and preparation are mandatory to ensure the safe and effective management of the airway in the pediatric trauma patient. Due to the various skills and expertise of different subspecialists, a multidisciplinary approach to such patients is recommended. Such an approach may include pediatricians, emergency room physicians, surgical subspecialists, anesthesiologists, and critical care physicians.",0,0
10217547,Effects of dexamethasone on airway hyper-responsiveness to the adenosine A1 receptor agonist cyclo-pentyl adenosine in an allergic rabbit model,"1. New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were immunized within 24 h of birth with Alternaria tenuis in aluminium hydroxide (Al (OH)3) (i.p.) or sham immunized (saline plus Al (OH)3 i.p.) and subsequently injected with the allergen (i.p.) or sham-immunized for the next 3 months. At 3 months of age, baseline airway responsiveness was assessed using cyclo-pentyl adenosine (CPA). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in all animals and samples of peripheral blood were collected from some animals for estimation of dexamethasone levels. In some animals, blood was collected at the end of the experiment and cellular function was assessed by measurement of ex vivo proliferation of mononuclear cells in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). 2. Allergen immunization significantly increased baseline airway responsiveness to inhaled CPA (P<0.05) in comparison with sham-immunized animals, at 3 months after immunization. Dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) treatment for 1 month did not modify this established airway hyper-responsiveness to CPA. Dexamethasone treatment did not affect either total or differential cell numbers in BAL fluid during the 4 week period, although significant plasma levels of dexamethasone were achieved in dexamethasone treated animals. 3. Treatment of rabbits with dexamethasone (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.), 6 h prior to each allergen injection from the neonatal stage, significantly reduced baseline airway hyper-responsiveness to CPA measured at 3 months (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in either total or differential cell numbers in BAL fluid, or any difference in mitogen-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells between dexamethasone and vehicle treated rabbits. 4. These results suggest that introduction of glucocorticosteroids in early life can prevent baseline airway hyper-responsiveness to inhaled CPA in allergic rabbits. However, once established, such underlying airway hyper-responsiveness is difficult to resolve, even with prolonged treatment with glucocorticosteroids.",0,0
24918851,Is the anesthesiologist actually prepared for loss of airway or respiratory function? A cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary hospital,"Objective: To identify compliance with the procedures for securing the airway of patients submitted to anesthesia, defined as highly recommended in the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted with 87 patients aged 18 to 60 years, classified as ASA grade 1 or 2 according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status Classification. The study variables consisted of: whether the Mallampati test had been performed, whether equipment was readily available for orotracheal intubation, whether the correct placement of the endotracheal tube was verified, whether patient ventilation was monitored and whether fasting was confirmed. Prevalence ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated as measures of relative risk. Statistical significance was defined at 5%. Results: It was found that in 87.4% of patients, the airway was not evaluated using the Mallampati classification and in 51.7% of cases, preoperative fasting was not confirmed. In 29.9% of cases, the ready availability of equipment for orotracheal intubation was not verified. In all of the cases in which the availability of this equipment was not checked, the patient was submitted to regional anesthesia, with a statistically significant difference compared to the cases in which the patient was submitted to general anesthesia. Conclusion: Measures considered essential for the safety of the patient during surgery are still being ignored.",0,0
9052311,The effect of goiter on endotracheal intubation,"The incidence of difficulty in tracheal intubation in the presence of goiter was investigated. Data were collected in a series of 4742 consecutive adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. The prevalence of goiter was 6.8%. Fifteen anesthesiologists performed the preoperative airway assessment using standardized guidelines. Seven individual risk factors were correlated with the potential for difficult tracheal intubation. Whenever evidence of goiter or airway pathology was observed, the evaluation was completed by indirect laryngoscopy and radiologic examination to establish the presence of any anatomical deviation. Difficult intubation was defined as inadequate exposure of the glottis by direct laryngoscopy. There was no difference in probability of difficulty in tracheal intubation between patients who presented for thyroidectomy and patients with goiter estimated as a random finding. Statistical analysis revealed an increased risk of difficult intubation amongst goiter patients compared with patients with no evidence of any risk factor (6.8% vs 0.9%, P < 10(-8), relative risk = 7.4). We conclude that goiter, when accompanied by airway deformity, constitutes an aggravating factor for difficult intubation.",0,0
26849245,Anatomical location of the vocal cords in relation to cervical vertebrae: A new predictor of difficult laryngoscopy?,"Background: Several anatomical factors, such as prognathism, sex, short thyromental distance and others are known to make direct laryngoscopy difficult. Objective: We investigated the hypothesis that the anatomical position of the vocal cords in relation to the cervical vertebrae correlates with difficult laryngoscopy. Existing MRI was used to identify the position of the vocal cords relative to the cervical spine in patients with and without difficult laryngoscopy. Design: Observational study with adaptive enrichment. Setting: University hospital. Patients: A total of 142 adult patients, 91 with easy (Cormack-Lehane class 1 or 2) and 51 with difficult (Cormack-Lehane class 3 or 4) laryngoscopy. Main outcome measures: Position of the vocal cords relative to cervical vertebrae in patients with easy vs. difficult laryngoscopy. Results: In patients with difficult laryngoscopy, we found a higher incidence of cranial position of the vocal cords in relation to the cervical spine compared with patients with easy laryngoscopy (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Anaesthesiologists should take advantage of existing imaging of the cervical spine when assessing the patient's airway.",0,0
23471156,Biomimetic metal oxides for the extraction of nanoparticles from water,"Contamination of nanomaterials in the environment will pose significant health risks in the future. A viable purification method is necessary to address this problem. Here we report the synthesis and application of a series of metal oxides prepared using a biological template for the removal of nanoparticles from the aqueous environment. A simple synthesis of metal oxides such as ZnO, NiO, CuO, Co3O4 and CeO2 employing eggshell membrane (ESM) as a biotemplate is reported. The morphology of the metal oxide powders was characterized using electron microscopes and the lattice structure was established using X-ray diffraction methods. Extraction of nanoparticles from water was carried out to compare the efficiency of metal oxides. NiO showed good extraction efficiency in removing gold and silver nanoparticles from spiked water samples within an hour. Easy access and enhanced stability of metal oxides makes them interesting candidates for applications in industrial effluent treatments and water purifications.",0,0
15316231,Use of morphological indicators to predict outcomes of palatopharyngeal surgery in patients with obstructive sleep apnea,"There is no consensus on how to quantify the abnormality of upper airway structures in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This research aimed to use morphological indicators as clinical predictors to correlate morphological stage and surgical results in OSA patients. One hundred and five patients with OSA received palatopharyngeal surgery, i.e. extended uvulopalatal flap (EUPF). Morphological indicators including modified Mallampati grade (MMP), tonsil size, and body mass index were used to stage OSA patients preoperatively. Change of respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was used to monitor change of sleep apnea events. Success rates were compared among patients of different morphological stages. One year after EUPF, the success rates of EUPF in stage I, II, and III patients were 100, 92.9 and 61.4%, respectively. Change of RDI was significantly correlated with MMP and tonsil size. MMP and tonsil size were predictive of the change of RDI (R(2) = 0.29). Morphological stage may serve as a reliable selection criterion for patients undergoing EUPF surgery and can significantly predict the change of sleep apnea events following EUPF surgery.",0,0
27482317,Difficult endotracheal intubation secondary to tracheal deviation and stenosis in a patient with severe kyphoscoliosis: a case report,"We report on a case of difficult endotracheal intubation in a patient with marked tracheal deviation at an angle of 90 degrees combined with stenosis due to kyphoscoliosis with vertebral body fusion. After induction of general anesthesia, a proper laryngeal view was easily obtained using a videolaryngoscope. But a tracheal tube could not be advanced more than 3 cm beyond the vocal cords due to resistance, despite various attempts, including the use of small size tubes, full rotation of the tube tip, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Ultimately, the airway was successfully secured by placing a tube tip above the area of resistance and by additionally packing saline-soaked gauzes around the tracheal inlet to minimize gas leakage and to fasten the tube in the trachea.",0,0
15684263,Glottic insertion of the ProSeal LMA occurs in 6% of cases: a review of 627 patients,"Purpose: Glottic insertion of the ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway (PLMA) has received little attention in the anesthesiology literature. We investigated the incidence and depth of insertion associated with this important cause for a failed insertion attempt with the PLMA. Methods: With Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed 15-months' use of the PLMA. Diagnosis of glottic insertion involved a test with children's bubble solution placed on the drain tube port, as well as a fibreoptic examination of the airway of patients experiencing airway obstruction. Patients were anesthetized and paralyzed and the PLMA was inserted deflated with the fingertip method (women size 4, men size 5). The cuff was inflated and a soap membrane established on the drain tube port. Glottic insertion was diagnosed by applying fingertip pressure to the patient's chest wall and observing pulmonary exhalation via the drain tube and bubble formation. The PLMA was then removed and reinserted without further assessment. For all patients, we used a fibrescope to determine the cause of unexplained airway obstruction after the PLMA was considered successfully inserted. Results: There were 627 patients (391 women, 236 men). We diagnosed glottic insertion in 38/627 (6.1%) patients, 37 by the soap membrane test and one with airway obstruction and direct fibreoptic visualization of malposition. Following glottic insertion, successful reinsertion of the PLMA behind the larynx was always associated with greater depth of insertion by an average 2.0 cm. Conclusion: Glottic insertion can be easily and quickly diagnosed and our results suggest the incidence and importance of malposition are under-reported in the literature.",0,0
24418184,Office-based lower airway endoscopy (OLAE) in pediatric patients: a high-value procedure,"Objectives: Office-based lower airway endoscopy (OLAE) is not a widespread practice in children due to concerns about its safety and efficacy. In 2003, we reported on OLAE in 105 children presenting with airway symptoms and found it both safe and effective as a diagnostic tool. The current study is a follow-up to the 2003 study that reports on an additional 122 pediatric patients who received OLAE with special attention to the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Methods: A retrospective review at a tertiary-quaternary pediatric institution of 122 consecutive pediatric patients in which an airway lesion, by history and initial physical exam, was determined to be present at the level of the supraglottic larynx to the carina. In all patients, airway endoscopy was performed in the office using flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL) and the endoscope was passed beyond the glottis to assess the lower airway, including the subglottis, trachea, and carina. The diagnoses were recorded and the number of times each diagnosis was encountered as well as the percent of patients who had each diagnosis was calculated. All cases requiring operating room procedures for further diagnosis or therapy were assessed for office-based and operating room diagnostic agreement. The ease of performing the lower airway assessment and the ease with which the subglottis, trachea, and carina were visualized were graded. An assessment for complications was also performed. Results: There were no complications with OLAE in any of the 122 patients. The percent of patients rated as having good visualization of anatomic structures were: 97% for visualization of the subglottis, 98% for visualization of the trachea, and 92% for visualization of the carina. In 93% of the cases the procedure was easily performed. There was excellent correlation between OLAE and operative endoscopy. Conclusion: OLAE continues to be a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of lower airway pathology in pediatric patients.",0,0

23931251,Difficult airway intubation with flexible bronchoscope,"Background and objective: To describe the efficacy and safety of a flexible bronchoscopy intubation (FBI) protocol in patients with difficult airway. Method: We reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with difficult airway who underwent flexible bronchoscopy intubation under spontaneous ventilation and sedation with midazolam and fentanyl from March 2009 to December 2010. Results: The study enrolled 102 patients, 69 (67.7%) men and 33 (32.3%) women, with a mean age of 44 years. FBI was performed in 59 patients (57.8%) with expected difficult airway in the operating room, in 39 patients (38.2%) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and in 4 patients (3.9%) in the emergency room. Cough, decrease in transient oxygen saturation, and difficult progression of the cannula through the larynx were the main complications, but these factors did not prevent intubation. Conclusion: FBI according to the conscious sedation protocol with midazolam and fentanyl is effective and safe in the management of patients with difficult airway.",0,0
15814760,[Propofol sedation allows awake intubation of the difficult airway with the Fastrach LMA],"Purpose: To evaluate target controlled infusion anesthesia (TCI) with propofol for conscious intubation [(Ramsay score equal to 3 (RS 3)] through the Fastrach laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Methods: 17 consenting and unpremedicated patients, who showed criteria for difficult intubation (score developed by Arne et al. > or = 11), were monitored and received supplemental oxygen. Propofol was administered by TCI, with successive targets of 0.6 and 1 microg x mL(-1), while the RS was evaluated: if = 3, LMA intubation was attempted, if < 3 the TCI was increased by steps of 0.2 microg x mL(-1) until an RS of 3 was reached. Local anesthesia (lidocaine 5%) of the oropharynx was carried out at 0.6 and 1 microg x mL(-1), together with local anesthesia of the nasopharynx at 1 microg x mL(-1). A standardized questionnaire evaluated memory of and satisfaction with the technique (score/10) on postoperative day 1. Results: The LMA was inserted in 100% of cases and intubation was successful in 16 out of 17 cases (one failure). The propofol target concentration to obtain a RS of 3 was 1.25 +/- 0.07 microg x mL(-1). Amnesia occurred as soon as the target concentration of propofol exceeded 1 microg x mL(-1). The patients found the technique very satisfactory (median satisfaction score = 9.4/10). Incidents of coughing or nausea were observed in 47% and 5% of cases respectively. There was no oesophageal intubation and no desaturation (SpO2 < 95%). Conclusion: Propofol administered by TCI to achieve a RS of 3 allows conscious intubation to be performed through a LMA under satisfactory conditions. A LMA could be a possible alternative to a ""conscious"" fibroscopy.",0,0

25886420,Facing the airway challenges in maxillofacial trauma: A retrospective review of 288 cases at a level i trauma center,"Background: Maxillofacial trauma is an apt example of a difficult airway. The anesthesiologist faces challenges in their management at every step from airway access to maintenance of anesthesia and extubation and postoperative care. Methods: A retrospective study was done of 288 patients undergoing surgery for maxillofacial trauma over a period of five years. Demographic data, detailed airway assessment and the method of airway access were noted. Trauma scores, mechanism of injury, duration of hospital stay, requirement of ventilator support were also recorded. Complications encountered during perioperative anaesthetic management were noted. Results: 259 (89.93%) of the patients were male and 188 (62.85%) were in the 21-40 year range. 97.57% of the cases were operated electively. 206 (71.53%) patients were injured in motor vehicular accidents. 175 (60.76%) had other associated injuries. Mean Glasgow coma scale score (GCS), injury severity score (ISS) and revised trauma score (RTS) were 14.18, 14.8 and 12, respectively. Surgery was performed almost nine days following injury. The mean duration of hospitalization was 16 days. ICU admission was required in 22 patients with mean duration of ICU stay being two days. Majority of patients had difficult airway. 240 (83.33%) patients were intubated in the operating room and fibreoptic guided intubation was done in 159 (55.21%) patients. Submental intubation was done in 45 (14.93%) cases. Conclusions: Maxillofacial injuries present a complex challenge to the anaesthesiologist. The fibreoptic bronchoscope is the main weapon available in our arsenal. The submental technique scores over the time-honored tracheostomy. Communication between the anaesthesiologist and the surgeon must be given paramount importance.",0,0
23798919,A study to investigate the relationship between difficult intubation and prediction criterion of difficult intubation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Background and aim: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is predisposed to the development of upper airway obstruction during sleep, and it poses considerable problem for anesthetic management. Difficult intubation (DI) is an important problem for management of anesthesia. In this clinical research, we aim to investigate the relationship between DI and prediction criteria of DI in cases with OSA. Materials and methods: We studied 40 [OSA (Group O, n = 20) and non-OSA, (Group C, n = 20)] ASA I-II, adult patients scheduled tonsillectomy under general anesthesia. Same anesthetic protocol was used in two groups. Intubation difficulties were assessed by Mallampati grading, Wilson sum score, Laryngoscopic grading (Cormack and Lehane), a line joining the angle of the mouth and tragus of the ear with the horizontal, sternomental distance, and tyromental distance. Demographic properties, time-dependent hemodynamic variables, doses of reversal agent, anesthesia and operation times, and recovery parameters were recorded. Results: Significant difference was detected between groups in terms of BMI, Mallampati grading, Wilson weight scores, Laryngoscopic grading, sternomental distance, tyromental distance, doses of reversal agent, and recovery parameters. Conclusion: OSA patient's DI ratio is higher than that of non-OSA patients. BMI Mallampati grading, Wilson weight scores, Laryngoscopic grading, sternomental distance, and tyromental distance evaluation might be predictors for DI in patients with OSA.",0,0
10447900,Hemifacial microsomia: anatomical prediction of difficult intubation,"Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is associated with a difficult airway. We hypothesized that a difficult intubation would be predicted by radiographic evaluation of the severity of mandibular hypoplasia. A retrospective review of anaesthetic and surgical records of 102 children with HFM from 1986 to 1996 was conducted for radiographic classification of mandibular hypoplasia and degree of difficulty with intubation. Intubation was classified as Grade A-easy, Grade B-difficult, or Grade C-very difficult. The mandibular anatomy was categorized as Type I-'mini-mandible', Type II-abnormal condylar size and shape, or Type III-absent ramus, condyle, and temporomandibular joint. In the 82 patients with HFM, 70% were classified as Grade A, 21% had Grade B and 9% had Grade C airways. No patients with Type I mandible had Grade C airway, while 25% of the patients with Type III mandible had Grade C airway. The correlation of the degree of airway difficulty with mandibular type was significant (P=0.001). In 20 patients with bilateral mandibular hypoplasia, 30% had Grade A, 35% had Grade B, and 35% had Grade C airways. We conclude that radiographic classification of mandibular deformity is a useful adjunct for preoperative prediction of airway difficulty in the management of children with unilateral HFM.",0,0

9052310,Clinical trial of a new device for fiberoptic orotracheal intubation (Augustine Scope),"Blind oral intubation using the Augustine Guide is helpful for intubating the trachea of patients presenting with difficult airways. This device has been modified by adding a fiberoptic scope with a built-in battery-powered light. We studied this Augustine Scope in 104 patients (Group AS) and compared the results with 96 patients managed by direct laryngoscopy (Group DL). No significant differences in Mallampati class, thyromental distance, laryngoscopic view, and patients height or weight were observed between the two groups. The Augustine Scope provided conditions for successful intubation in 102 of 104 patients (98%), compared with a 97% success rate in the group where DL was used. The three patients who failed DL were successfully intubated with AS. The mean +/- SD time needed to perform intubation was 19 +/- 10 s in Group AS and 21 +/- 13 s in Group DL (P = not significant). No traumatizing effects were observed. We conclude that the Augustine Scope is an effective and safe device for orotracheal intubation in routine and difficult airways.",0,0

There were no significant anaesthetic or surgical complications and the mean intra-operative blood loss was 176 ml. The Mallampati score did not correlate with the Cormack and Lehane glottic view and there were no difficult intubations. Pre-operative trismus resolved completely during induction in 77.4% of cases. We concluded that the Mallampati grading system is not applicable in quinsies and in cases with palatopharyngeal arch distortion, that trismus in quinsies is due to muscle spasm and resolves completely during induction in most cases and that pre-anaesthetic drainage of the abscess together with rehydration and antibiotics are important contributing factors to safe anaesthesia for quinsy.",0,0
19860233,[Difficult tracheal intubation using airway scope in a pediatric patient with Hunter syndrome],"Hunter syndrome, manifested by mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), is a hereditary disorder caused by accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. An important issue in regard to anesthesia in affected individuals is airway management, because of gargoylism. An 8-year-old boy with MPS II was scheduled for adenotonsillectomy. We performed slow induction with sevoflurane, then utilized an Airway Scope (AWS; HOYA Corporation Tokyo, Japan), which enables operators to observe tube passage through the vocal cords with an LCD monitor, for tracheal intubation, because intubation guided by a fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was considered to be risky for glottic damage. Attempted tracheal intubations with the AWS alone and in combination with an FOB inserted through the tracheal tube failed, even though a clear image of the glottis was obtained. Finally, we inserted a stylet into the tracheal tube attached to the blade of the AWS and successful tracheal intubation was accomplished. The operation was completed uneventfully and the patient entered the ICU with his trachea intubated, because of pharyngeal and laryngeal edema. Although useful for difficult airway management, tracheal intubation with the AWS may be difficult when used in patients with a narrow oral cavity or small tracheal tube.",0,0
1489129,Aerosolized beclomethasone in chronic bronchitis. Improved pulmonary function and diminished airway inflammation,"Chronic bronchitis is associated with airways obstruction and inflammation. In order to determine whether aerosolized beclomethasone can modulate airway inflammation and diminish airway obstruction, subjects with chronic bronchitis performed spirometry and underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) before and after receiving 6 wk of therapy (five puffs four times a day) with either aerosolized beclomethasone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. All subjects received aerosolized albuterol before each use of the study medications. Before BAL, the airways were visually assessed for the appearance of inflammation and assigned a score, the bronchitis index. BAL was performed by instilling five 20-ml aliquots of saline into each of three sites and pooling and separately analyzing the returns from the first aliquots to yield a ""bronchial sample."" The bronchial lavages were repeated in an additional three sites to increase the volume of fluid available for analysis. The fluid was prepared for cytologic examination by cytocentrifugation. Albumin (as a measure of epithelium permeability) and lactoferrin and lysozyme (as measures of serous cell activity) were measured in unconcentrated BAL fluid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and concentrations in epithelial lining fluid were estimated using urea as an internal marker for dilution. After treatment, the beclomethasone group, but not the placebo group, showed improvement in FVC (p = 0.02), FEV1 (p = 0.002), and 25 to 75% forced expiratory flow (p = 0.006). Associated with the improvement in spirometry, the bronchitis index fell (13.5 +/- 1.0 versus 10.75 +/- 1.1, p = 0.02) in the beclomethasone-treated group, but not the placebo-treated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
24601120,[Boy with Coffin-Lowry syndrome associated with spinal cord injuries],"A 12-year-old male patient with Coffin-Lowry syndrome was scheduled for posterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical spinal injuries. The patient had features of Coffin-Lowry syndrome including mental retardation, prominent forehead, a short nose with a wide tip, a wide mouth with full lips, short stature, microcephaly, and kyphoscoliosis. We anticipated major troubles related to anesthesia such as difficult ventilation and intubation, communication difficulty during induction and extubation, and difficulty in using a naso-pharyngeal airway. In addition, we had to stabilize neck alignments during intubation because cervical vertebrae were unstable and spinal cord has already been injured. Therefore, we scheduled slow induction with sevoflurane maintaining spontaneous respiration. As we found the full mouth opening of the patient after the induction, we inserted an intubating laryngeal mask, through which ventilation was successfully maintained. A tracheal tube was inserted through the intubating laryngeal mask. When the surgery was completed, we extubated using a tube introducer in the trachea. As we found that the patient's airway was open, we removed the introducer. In conclusion, with a thorough planning of the anesthetic management, we successfully managed anesthesia for cervical spinal surgery in a patient with Coffin-Lowry syndrome.",0,0

8042812,What is the best way to determine oropharyngeal classification and mandibular space length to predict difficult laryngoscopy?,"Background: Previous studies have suggested that the degree of visibility of oropharyngeal structures (OP class) and mandibular space (MS) length can predict difficult laryngoscopy. However, those studies were either inconsistent or omit description of how to perform these tests with regard to body, head and tongue position, and the use of phonation, hyoid versus thyroid cartilage and inside versus outside of the mentum. The purpose of this investigation was to determine which method of testing best predicts difficult laryngoscopy. Methods: In each of 213 consenting adults the OP class was determined in 24 method combinations: two body positions (sitting and supine), three head positions (neutral, sniff, and full extension), two tongue positions (in and out), and with and without phonation. In each patient MS length was measured in 24 method combinations: two body positions (sitting and supine), three head positions (neutral, sniff, and full extension), two distal end points (hyoid and thyroid cartilage), and two proximal end points (inside and outside of the mentum). In each patient the laryngoscopic grade was determined at the time of induction of anesthesia. We defined laryngoscopic grades III (n = 24) and 4 (n = 0) as difficult. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area) for each combination was used to compare the combinations and determine significant differences: ROC area = 0.5 implied a totally uninformative combination and ROC area = 1.0 a combination that predicted perfectly. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate a predictor of difficult intubation that combined both OP class and MS length (the performance index). The performance index could then be used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and probability of difficult intubation. Results: The ROC areas for the different combinations used to assess OP class ranged from 0.78 to 0.94. The best combination was with the patient sitting, head in extension, tongue out, and with or without phonation. For MS length, the ROC areas ranged from 0.58 to 0.77; the best combination was the patient sitting, with the head in extension, with distance measured from the inside of the mentum to the thyroid cartilage. Combining the OP class and MS length (performance index = 2.5 X OP class - MS length in centimeters) significantly increased predictability of difficult intubation. At performance index = 0 and = 2, the probability of difficult intubation was 3.5% and 24%, respectively. With clinically relevant cutpoints for the performance index it was found that most difficult intubations could be predicted, but approximately half of those predicted to be difficult would in fact be easy. Conclusions: Based on the above ROC areas and ease of performing the test for the patient, we recommend that these tests be performed with patients in the sitting position, with the head in full extension, the tongue out, and with phonation, and with distance measured from the thyroid cartilage to inside of the mentum. Nevertheless, it is clear that these two tests, either used alone or in combination, will fail to predict a few difficult laryngoscopies and that they will predict difficult laryngoscopy in a significant number of patients in whom the trachea is easy to intubate.",0,0
22643044,Performance of emergency physicians utilizing a video-assisted semi-rigid fiberoptic stylet for intubation of a difficult airway in a high-fidelity simulated patient: a pilot study,"Background: This study was designed to evaluate emergency physician success and satisfaction using a video-assisted semi-rigid fiberoptic stylet, the Clarus Video System (CVS), during a simulated difficult airway scenario. Findings: Emergency physicians (EPs) of all levels were first shown a brief slide show and three example videos, and then given 20 min to practice intubating a mannequin using both the CVS and standard direct laryngoscopy (DL). The mannequin was then placed in a c-collar and set to simulate an apneic patient with an edematous tongue and trismus. Each EP was given up to three timed attempts with each technique. They rated their satisfaction with the CVS, usefulness for their practice, and the effectiveness of the tutorial. Direct laryngoscopy had a 65% success rate on the first attempt, 20% on the second, and 15% required three or more. The CVS had a 100% success rate with a single attempt. Average time for independent DL attempts was 43.41 s (SD = ±26.82) and 38.71 s (SD = ±34.14) with CVS. Cumulative attempt times were analyzed and compared (DL = 74.55 ± 68.40 s and CVS = 38.71 ± 34.14 s; p = 0.028). EPs rated their satisfaction with, and usefulness of, the CVS as ≥6 out of 10.

19825054,The use of mandibular nerve block to predict safe anaesthetic induction in patients with acute trismus,"Acute trismus can be caused by pain, muscle spasm, swelling or mechanical obstruction. Unfortunately, the cause is not always obvious during pre-operative airway assessment. In this pilot study, we prospectively evaluated mandibular nerve block as a pre-operative tool to identify patients with reversible causes of trismus, namely pain or spasm, in order to allow safe anaesthetic induction. Six patients with unilateral fractured mandibles and trismus received a mandibular nerve block before induction of general anaesthesia. There was an increase in maximal inter-incisor gap after the blocks (median (range) distance: pre-block 16.5 (14-30) and post-block 34 (32-35) mm; p = 0.027), and no further improvement after induction of general anaesthesia (post-induction 37 (30-40) mm; p = 0.276 compared with post-block). There was an improvement in pain scores (p = 0.027), and no side-effects were detected.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that maternal Mallampati class (MC), as a marker for OSA, is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Study design: We performed a retrospective secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of term births (≥ 37 weeks). Fetal anomalies and aneuploidy were excluded. Primary outcome was small for gestational age (SGA). Secondary outcomes included preeclampsia, neonatal cord arterial blood gas pH < 7.10 and < 7.05, base excess < - 8 and < - 12 mEq/L.

11867407,Morbid obesity and tracheal intubation,"The tracheas of obese patients may be more difficult to intubate than those of normal-weight patients. We studied 100 morbidly obese patients (body mass index >40 kg/m(2)) to identify which factors complicate direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Preoperative measurements (height, weight, neck circumference, width of mouth opening, sternomental distance, and thyromental distance) and Mallampati score were recorded. The view during direct laryngoscopy was graded, and the number of attempts at tracheal intubation was recorded. Neither absolute obesity nor body mass index was associated with intubation difficulties. Large neck circumference and high Mallampati score were the only predictors of potential intubation problems. Because in all but one patient the trachea was intubated successfully by direct laryngoscopy, the neck circumference that requires an intervention such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy to establish an airway remains unknown. We conclude that obesity alone is not predictive of tracheal intubation difficulties. Implications: In 100 morbidly obese patients, neither obesity nor body mass index predicted problems with tracheal intubation. However, a high Mallampati score (greater-than-or-equal to 3) and large neck circumference may increase the potential for difficult laryngoscopy and intubation.",1,1
9065945,Airway function tests and vocal cord paralysis in lung transplant recipients,"Maximum expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume (MEFV, MIFV) curves, specific airway conductance (sGaw), and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy were examined in 8 pediatric lung transplant recipients with vocal cord paralysis (VCP). Six were heart-lung (H-L) and 2 double-lung (D-L) recipients, 7 had left VCP, and 1 had right VCP. Based on the pulmonary function tests (PFT), 2 subgroups could be distinguished in the 8 recipients with VCP. Group A (5/8 recipients; mean age, 13 +/- 3.4 years; mean height, 144.3 +/- 12.3 cm) had significantly reduced specific airway conductance (sGaw; < 2 SD from predicted) and normal MEF25, MEF50, peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and %FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC); this pattern suggested variable extrathoracic airway obstruction. PIF was normal in 4/5 and reduced in 1/5 of these recipients. Group B (3/8 recipients with VCP; mean age, 17 +/- 2.4 years; mean height, 156.3 +/- 12.0 cm) had significantly reduced sGaw, MEF25, MEF50, PEF, FEV1, and %FEV1/FVC, implying primarily small airway obstruction. These recipients had bronchiolitis obliterans. The results suggest that a pattern of reduced sGaw and normal MEFs, PEF, FEV1, and PIF should raise the possibility of VCP in patients after lung transplantation. sGaw is more sensitive than PIF and PEF in identifying airway obstruction due to VCP, and should be routinely included in the follow-up evaluation of lung transplant recipients.",0,0
22068700,Moderate sedation for elective upper endoscopy with balanced propofol versus fentanyl and midazolam alone: a randomized clinical trial,"Background and study aims: Balanced propofol sedation (BPS) combines propofol with opiates and benzodiazepines and targets at moderate sedation. Data comparing outcomes of BPS and standard sedation with opiates and benzodiazepines during elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) are sparse. The primary end point of this study was to compare, in the recovery area, patient satisfaction with EGD following BPS versus standard sedation. Patients and methods: Prospective, single-blinded randomized trial in 110 outpatients undergoing elective EGD and randomized 1:1 to BPS or standard sedation. Upon full recovery, the primary outcome of patient satisfaction was assessed using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (1 = not at all satisfied, 100 = completely satisfied). Sedation recovery times and recall of pain and gagging (1 = none, 100 = severe) were also evaluated using a VAS. Results: The BPS and standard sedation groups were similar regarding American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Mallampati class, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Compared with the standard sedation arm, the BPS group exhibited higher median procedural satisfaction (99 vs. 85, P < 0.001), and lower median scores for recall of pain (P < 0.001) and gagging (P < 0.001). BPS resulted in a shorter median recovery time (min) (11 vs. 23, P < 0.001). On multivariable regression analysis, predictors of patient satisfaction included use of propofol, increased age, and higher fentanyl dosage. Conclusions: BPS targeted to moderate sedation by adequately trained endoscopists results in superior patient satisfaction and shorter recovery times than standard sedation alone during EGD.",0,0
18280099,[Quality indicator survey of anaesthesia records in hospitals of Aquitaine],"Objectives: Assessing the quality of anaesthesia records according to the criteria of the reference frame of professional practices evaluation proposed by the French Anaesthetists College (Cfar) in 2005. Study design: Retrospective, multicentric study. Materials and methods: Fifty anaesthesia records were randomly selected from each of the 64 health care settings in Aquitaine with an inpatient surgery activity. Survey sampling was based on hospital stays longer than 24h occurring during the second half of 2005 and including a surgical procedure under anaesthesia, excepting local anaesthesia or regional analgesia for labour and delivery. Information regarding the 10 evaluation criteria defined by the Cfar and the French National Authority for Health were gathered. For each setting, the mean completion of the 50 records was rated by a global indicator defined by the number of criteria in conformity divided by the number of relevant criteria. Results: Three thousand one hundred and ninety-three anaesthetic files were screened. The completion of criteria varied between 1 and 92% with a wide dispersion for some criteria according to settings. Completions of airway assessment, preanaesthetic visit and perianaesthetic incidents/accidents were lower than 50%. The median conformity rate of the global indicator was 57%. Conclusion: This study brings information concerning the clinical relevance of anaesthesia records and preoperative evaluation practices.",0,0
26230452,Immobilization and volume reduction of heavy metals in municipal solid waste fly ash using nano-size calcium and iron-dispersed reagent,"This study was conducted to examine the synthesis and application of novel nano-size calcium/iron-based composite material as an immobilizing and separation treatment of the heavy metals in fly ash from municipal solid waste incineration. After grinding with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO and with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO₄], approximately 30 wt% and 25 wt% of magnetic fraction fly ash were separated. The highest amount of entrapped heavy metals was found in the lowest weight of the magnetically separated fly ash fraction (i.e., 91% in 25% of treated fly ash). Heavy metals in the magnetic or nonmagnetic fly ash fractions were about 98% and 100% immobilized, respectively. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS) observations indicate that the main fraction of enclosed/bound materials on treated fly ash includes Ca/PO₄-associated crystalline complexes. After nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO₄] treatment, the heavy metal concentrations in the fly ash leachate were much lower than the Japan standard regulatory limit for hazardous waste landfills. These results appear to be extremely promising. The addition of a nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/PO₄mixture with simple grinding technique is potentially applicable for the remediation and volume reduction of fly ash contaminated by heavy metals. Implications: After grinding with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO and nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO₄], approximately 30 wt% and 25 wt% of magnetic fraction fly ash were separated. The highest amount of entrapped heavy metals was found in the lowest weight of the magnetically separated fly ash fraction (i.e., 91% in 25% of treated fly ash), whereas heavy metals either in the magnetic or nonmagnetic fly ash fractions were about 98% and 100% immobilized. These results appear to be very promising, and the addition of nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/PO₄mixture with simple grinding technique may be considered potentially applicable for the remediation and volume reduction of contaminated fly ash by heavy metals.",0,0
24000653,[Video laryngoscopy and retromolar endoscopy in maxillofacial surgery],"The article presents successful intubation experience in 54 patients. Laryngoscopy was performed with McGrath Series 5 laryngoscopy with a difficult airway blade (""Airway Medical"") in 46 patients, and retromolar endoscope Bonfils (""Karl Storz"") in 9 patients. Technical traits, resulting from the use video laryngoscopy and retromolar endoscope are discussed. It was shown that video laryngoscopy is a high-performance intubation technique, including difficult ones. The possibility of video laryngoscope conduction in case of significant difficulties with mouth opening (max incisors distance of 1.3 cm) and atlantoccipital immobility make this method a real support to fiber bronchoscope intubation. Retromolar orotracheal intubation with Bonfils stylet training is associated with difficulties in case of insufficient endoscopy skills. During intubation the rule should be used: ""to enter prorsad, do everything vice versa"". The use of videolaryngoscopy and retromolar intubation is a real support for standard laryngoscopy and fiberbronchoscopy during orotracheal intubation including difficult ones. Difficult intubation may result from mouth opening restriction, atlantoocciital immobility and orolaryngopharynx deformation because of edema and rigidity, for example after an osteotomy or tumors presence. Videolaryngoscopy master is easier than retromolar endoscopy, because videolaryngoscope construction, laryngoscopy technique and larynx structures visualization are similar to the classic MAC blades.",0,0
12833493,Airway anomalies in children with Down syndrome: endoscopic findings,"Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal anomaly in humans. Numerous congenital malformations associated with DS have been described. However, there are insufficient data available about airway anomalies. Our objective was to characterize the clinical presentation, frequency, and type of airway anomalies in a population of patients with DS. A retrospective evaluation of flexible bronchoscopies performed in 24 DS patients due to significant respiratory morbidity was compared to the findings in 324 non-DS patients during the same time period. The procedure was carried out under sedation, using an Olympus BF3C20 bronchoscope. The main indications for the procedure were atelectasis of the right upper lobe (12/24) and stridor (7/24). The most common associated conditions were congenital heart disease (12/24) and reactive airways disease (12/24). The most important endoscopic findings were: laryngomalacia (12/24), tracheomalacia (8/24), tracheal bronchus (5/24), and bronchomalacia (5/24). Only six patients had a normal examination. Multiple airway anomalies (>/=2) were a common finding in this series. We conclude that patients with DS and respiratory symptoms have a high incidence of airway anomalies compared to non-DS patients. The clinician should have a high index of suspicion for airway anomalies in DS patients with respiratory symptoms.",0,0
15679130,Improving the success rate of laryngeal mask airway insertion during etomidate induction by using fentanyl or succinylcholine,"Background: Smooth and successful insertion of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) during etomidate induction requires a proper mouth opening and efforts to minimize airway reflexes such as gagging, coughing, or laryngospasm. We hypothesized that the concurrent use of fentanyl or succinylcholine with etomidate, the induction agent, could reduce the occurrence of airway reflexes and increase the success rate of LMA. Methods: Sixty adult patients, ASA class I-II, scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, were randomly allocated into three groups: group I in which patients were given etomidate 0.3 mg/kg alone; group 2 in which patients were given fentanyl 2 microg/kg and etomidate 0.3 mg/kg; groups 3 in which patients were give etomidate 0.3 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg. All patients were premedicated with atropine 0.01 mg/kg. When induction of anesthesia began we recorded the time from administering the designated regiminal agent or agents to the time of relaxation of jaw (the ease of mouth opening) and checked the patient for any excitatory movement after administering the induction agents. After inserting the LMA, we checked for signs of airway reflexes. Student's t test, Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the data. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: There were no significant differences in demographic data among the the three groups. The concurrent use of fentanyl or succinylcholine with etomidate during induction could significantly reduce the occurrence of excitatory movements and airway reflexes after LMA insertion, and increase the success rate of LMA insertion in comparison with using etomidate alone. Comparing the two adjutant agents, the concurrent use of succinylcholine could provide a significantly better jaw relaxation, shorten the time to insert the LMA and increase the success rate of LMA insertion. Conclusions: As an induction agent to facilitate insertion of LMA, etomidate alone was far from perfect. The concurrent use of 2 microg/kg of fentanyl with etomidate might significantly reduce the occurrence of airway reflexes in response to LMA insertion and increase the success rate of insertion. However, concurrent use of 1 mg/kg succinylcholine with etomidate might provide better results in terms of shortened time for the LMA insertion, jaw relaxation, and the success rate of LMA insertion than that of fentanyl.",0,0
18840591,"Emergency Cesarean delivery for umbilical cord prolapse: the head-down, knee-chest prone position for spinal anesthesia","Objective: Umbilical cord prolapse in a parturient is an emergency, where the need for immediate fetal delivery may conflict with maternal anesthetic risk factors. We describe the anesthetic management of a parturient who was rushed to the operating room, in the knee-chest prone position, because of cord prolapse with variable decelerations of fetal heart rate. Clinical features: A 28-yr-old multiparous patient presented at 37 weeks gestation. Her co-morbidities included morbid obesity and asthma. She had a Mallampati class IV airway. She required emergency Cesarean delivery, in view of umbilical cord prolapse, with evidence of fetal compromise. In light of the airway concerns, the urgency to proceed with delivery, and the presence of a palpable umbilical cord pulse in this position, we performed a spinal anesthetic in the knee-chest prone position, and immediately thereafter turned the patient supine, with lateral uterine displacement. Fetal heart rate was monitored throughout the procedure. The spinal anesthetic required less than five minutes to perform, from the time of skin preparation, until readiness for surgery. The subsequent surgical and anesthetic course was unremarkable. Conclusions: Performing spinal anesthesia in the knee-chest prone position served as an innovative solution for emergency Cesarean delivery in this case. Both the head-down lateral, and the head-down knee-chest prone positions, are compatible with spinal anesthesia, and the maternal position that achieves relief of cord compression, determined by the presence of a palpable umbilical cord pulse, may be the most important factor to determine the optimal approach to spinal anesthesia.",0,0
8874915,"Anaesthetic management of a parturient with severe muscular dystrophy, lumbar lordosis and a difficult airway","Purpose: This case describes the management of a 19-yr-old wheelchair bound primigravida with severe muscular dystrophy who presented for Caesarean section after spontaneous rupture of membranes. Anaesthesia was influenced by several features of her systemic disease which were impediments to both neuraxial and general anaesthesia. Clinical features: Other than for a prenatal record and the history obtainable from the patient, little additional medical information was available. Physical examination showed diffuse muscular weakness and an anatomically abnormal airway. Examination of the spine showed slight 10-15 degrees thoracolumbar scoliosis and > 45 degrees lumbar lordosis. Fetal assessment was normal. Echocardiography revealed mildly decreased left ventricular function and was consistent with pulmonary hypertension. After discussion with the patient and her obstetrician, elective Caesarean delivery was deemed the best management. Neuroaxial anaesthesia was at an increased risk of failure due to the profound lumbar lordosis. A plan for awake intubation and general anaesthesia was described to the patient in case regional anaesthesia could not be initiated. A fibreoptic bronchoscope and difficult intubation kit were made available. General anaesthesia was expected to have increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, hence epidural anaesthesia was attempted. After difficult catheter insertion, a sensory block was titrated to a T4 level. This was well tolerated by both mother and fetus. A healthy baby was delivered with Apgar scores of 9 and 9. Postoperatively the mother was transferred to the intensive care unit. After 72 hr, the patients respiratory status allowed transfer to the word. Conclusion: This case illustrates the use of epidural anaesthesia in the successful management of a severely compromised patient with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy undergoing elective Caesarean section.",0,0
9275382,[Comparative observation on the relationship between the MEFV and the visual inspection of small airway],"Objective: To compare the relationship between the MEFV and the visual inspection of small airway. Methods: According to the result on small airway function test (MEFV), the patients were divided into two group: MEFV abnormal group and MEFV normal group. Their bronchus and peripheral airway were observed with bronchofiberscope and ultra-thin bronchofiberscope. The visual appearance of the airways was scored in the light of the presence or absence of erythema, edema, secretions, etc. Results: The score of visual appearance observed or bronchitis index (BI) in small airway was 7.7 +/- 0.8 (BI: 3.0 +/- 0.8) and 4.7 +/- 1.6 (BI: 1.5 +/- 0.5) respectively in MEFV abnormal group and in MEFV normal group, namely the score in MEFV abnormal group was significantly higher than that of normal group (P < 0.01). The degree of pathological change in small airway was significantly correlated with the results of V25, V50, r = -0.6271, (P < 0.05) and r = 0.6964, (P < 0.02). Conclusion: The abnormal of MEFV may reflect inflamative pathological changes of small airway.",0,0
2021992,Perioperative management of paediatric microstomia,"Paediatric microstomia may occur congenitally in the whistling face syndrome but is more often acquired after accidental thermal injuries such as biting an electrical extension cord or ingesting household lye. The surgical correction of microstomia includes separation and cosmetic reconstruction of the fused lips and postoperative oral splinting. Microstomia from lye ingestion may be associated not only with limited mouth opening but also with such severe intraoral scarring that common landmarks guiding either rigid or flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy are obscured, rendering oral and nasotracheal intubation difficult or impossible. We report a case of paediatric microstomia after lye ingestion in which conventional direct laryngoscopy, flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy, and multiple blind nasal approaches to tracheal intubation were unsuccessful. However, tracheostomy was avoided and successful tracheal intubation was accomplished using a new rigid tubular pharyngolaryngoscope.",0,0

19704335,Narrow-band imaging bronchoscopy increases the specificity of bronchoscopic early lung cancer detection,"Background: Detection of nonsmall cell lung cancer at the intraepithelial stage is believed to improve cure rates. New bronchoscopic technologies, including white light videobronchoscopy (WLB), autofluorescence imaging (AFI), and narrow band imaging (NBI), are aiming to diagnose airway neoplasia at a preinvasive stage. Objectives: : To evaluate the diagnostic yields of NBI individually and in combination with WLB and AFI. Methods: A 10-month review of patients who were referred for airway screening or surveillance. Patients were randomized as to the order of AFI and NBI examinations. The airway mucosa was graded endoscopically as ""normal,"" ""abnormal,"" ""suspicious,"" or ""tumor."" All areas that were not normal were biopsied. Biopsies with a histologic grading of moderate to severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ were considered positive for intraepithelial neoplasia. Results: Sixty-two patients with a mean age of 56.2 +/- 9.8 years were studied. Five patients had invasive cancers and were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 57 cases had a 30% prevalence of intraepithelial neoplasia. The sensitivity of WLB was 0.18 and the specificity was 0.88. The relative sensitivities (compared with WLB) of AFI and NBI were 3.7 (p = 0.005) and 3.0 (p = 0.03), respectively. The relative specificities of AFI and NBI were 0.5 (p < 0.001) and 1.0 (p = 0.72), respectively. Combining AFI and NBI did not increase diagnostic yield significantly. The sequence of performing AFI and NBI did not impact findings. Conclusions: NBI is an alternative to AFI in the detection of early lung cancers because it has a comparatively higher specificity without significantly compromising the sensitivity.",0,0
21940397,"Randomized controlled trial of the A.P.

We compared the McGrath(®) Series 5 and the Venner™ A.P. Advance™ (APA) videolaryngoscopes with a Macintosh laryngoscope by studying the performance of experienced anaesthetists using manikins in normal and difficult airway scenarios. Methods: We recruited 48 anaesthetists into a randomized trial. Each performed tracheal intubation with each laryngoscope in one easy and one difficult laryngoscopy scenario. The primary endpoint was time to intubation. Other endpoints were time to best glottic visualization, grade of view, and number of glottic advances. Results: There were no dropouts. In the easy scenario, the time to intubation was greater using the McGrath [median time 40.7 s, inter-quartile range (IQR) 31.0, 57.4, P<0.001] than the other devices. In the difficult scenario, the time to intubation using the APA with Difficult Airway Blade (DAB) was less (median time 23.2 s, IQR 19.8, 29.0, P<0.001) than the other devices. Time to glottic visualization was reduced using the McGrath and the APA with DAB. Glottic advances were fewer using the APA with DAB. Conclusions: Experienced anaesthetists required a longer time for intubation in a standard manikin using a McGrath compared with other laryngoscopes, but a shorter time for intubation in a difficult manikin using an APA with DAB, and with fewer glottic advances, compared with other laryngoscopes.",0,0

16717309,Video assessment of supraglottic airway orientation through the perilaryngeal airway in pediatric patients,"The COBRA perilaryngeal airway (PLA) is a new supraglottic airway device available for use in children. We studied the orientation of the larynx as viewed through the PLA using video obtained with a fiberoptic bronchoscope in 45 infants and children. Laryngeal view was scored, and position of the grill bars of the PLA and the epiglottis was assessed. An acceptable airway was obtained in all subjects, but the laryngeal view was nearly or completely obstructed in 76.9% of the patients 10 kg and less, with the epiglottis folded over the glottic opening. This was uncommon in larger children. The grill bars of the PLA were closely opposed to the epiglottis and supraglottic structures in nearly all subjects. We conclude that 1) the PLA provides an acceptable airway in infants and children, but infolding of the epiglottis with obstruction of the view of the glottic opening is common in infants, 2) extra vigilance for airway obstruction in this age group is necessary, and 3) the PLA's close opposition to the supraglottic structures suggests that removal in a deeper plane of anesthesia might minimize laryngeal stimulation.",0,0
2331084,[Anesthetic technics for the difficult intubation],"Numerous anaesthetic techniques exist for a patient who presents with a difficult endotracheal intubation. They all require an anaesthetic protocol which cannot be improvised. When intubation is expected to be difficult at the pre-anaesthetic examination, the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope is the technique of choice for intubating adults under local anaesthesia, and children under general anaesthesia. When a fiberoptic bronchoscope is not available, several alternatives can be suggested: local anaesthesia of the glottis, retro-molar and retrograde intubation, or the use of a guide threaded over a lighted stylet; these techniques can be used in an anaesthetized patient breathing spontaneously. In the paralyzed patient impossible to intubate, various trans-laryngeal techniques of ventilation can be used in emergency: jet ventilation via the trans-crico-thyroid route, the use of a cricotomy cannula, or a minitracheotomy set.",0,0
23878439,Predicting difficult laryngoscopy in acromegalic patients undergoing surgery for excision of pituitary tumors: A comparison of extended Mallampati score with modified Mallampati classification,"Background: There are numerous reports of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in patients with acromegaly. To date, no study has assessed the application of extended Mallampati score (EMS) for predicting difficult intubation in acromegalics. The primary aim of this study was to compare EMS with modified Mallampati classification (MMP) in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in acromegalic patients. We hypothesized that since EMS has been reported to be more specific and better predictor than MMP, it may be superior to the MMP to predict difficult laryngoscopy in acromegalic patients. Materials and methods: For this prospective cohort study with matched controls, acromegalic patients scheduled to undergo pituitary surgery over a period of 3 years (January 2008-December 2010) were enrolled. Preoperative airway assessment was performed by experienced anesthesiologists and involved a MMP and the EMS. Under anesthesia, laryngoscopic view was assessed using Cormack-Lehane (CL) grading. MMP and CL grades of I and II were defined ""easy"" and III and IV as ""difficult"". EMS grade of I and II were defined ""easy"" and III as ""difficult"". Data were used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of MMP and EMS in predicting difficult laryngoscopy. Results: Seventy eight patients participated in the study (39 patients in each group). Both MMP and EMS failed to detect difficult laryngoscopy in seven patients. Only one laryngoscopy was predicted to be difficult by both tests which was in fact, difficult. Conclusion: We found that addition of neck extension did not improve the predictive value of MMP.",0,0

Her first delivery had been performed by C/S under general anesthesia at a regional hospital 6 years before. Preoperative airway assessment showed normal mouth opening and mobile cervical spine. Since she had anxiety about needle puncture and refused neuraxial blockade and since we considered the trachea could be intubated, we decided to perform C/S under general anesthesia at 37 weeks of gestation. The patient and baby had an uneventful perioperative course. Underdevelopment of bone formation results in characteristic craniofacial and vertebral abnormalities in patients with achondroplasia.

24866377,"A survey of Canadian anesthesiologists' preferences in difficult intubation and ""cannot intubate, cannot ventilate"" situations","Introduction: The purpose of this survey was to determine the equipment that anesthesiologists prefer in difficult tracheal intubation and ""cannot intubate, cannot ventilate"" (CICV) situations. Methods: A questionnaire was e-mailed to members of the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society to ascertain their preferences, experience, and comfort level with regard to their use of airway equipment in difficult intubation and CICV situations in adult patients. A Chi square test was used to analyse the data. All reported P values are two-sided. Results: Nine hundred ninety-seven of 2,532 questionnaires (39%) were returned. In an unanticipated difficult direct laryngoscopic intubation situation, 893 of 997 (90%) respondents chose a video laryngoscope as the first-choice rescue technique, while 41 (4%) and 21 (2%) of respondents chose a flexible bronchoscope and an intubating laryngeal mask airway device, respectively. The majority of anesthesiologists had experience and were comfortable with using a flexible bronchoscope or a video laryngoscope. Regarding CICV, 294 of 955 (31%) respondents stated that they had never encountered it. Wire-guided cricothyroidotomy was chosen as the first-choice surgical airway by 375 of 955 (39%) respondents, while intravenous catheter cricothyroidotomy and ""defer to tracheostomy by surgeon"" were selected by 266 (28%) and 215 (23%) respondents, respectively. Seven hundred eighty-five of 997 (78%) respondents were familiar with the exact steps of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' difficult airway algorithm, while 448 (47%) had attended an airway workshop within the past five years. Conclusions: In a difficult intubation situation, the most frequently selected first-choice airway device was a video laryngoscope, followed by a flexible bronchoscope. In a CICV situation, the most frequently selected first-choice surgical airway technique was a wire-guided cricothyroidotomy, followed by an intravenous catheter cricothyroidotomy.",0,0

26427628,Validation of human small airway measurements using endobronchial optical coherence tomography,"Background: Small airway remodeling is the cardinal feature underlying chronic airway diseases. There is no modality which identifies small airway pathological changes, which is crucial for early diagnosis, efficacy and prognostic assessment. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of endobronchial optical coherence tomography (EB-OCT) in assessing small airways morphology in vivo. Methods: Twelve patients with pulmonary nodules scheduled for lung resection underwent spirometry, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and EB-OCT. We measured D(mean) (mean luminal diameter), Ai (inner luminal area), Aw (airway wall area) and Aw% [Aw/(Ai + Aw) × 100%] from the 3rd to 5th generation bronchi of RB9 segment by MDCT. D(mean), Ai, Aw and Aw% from the 3rd to 9th generation bronchi of RB9 segment were measured by EB-OCT and histology. Correlations of these parameters, measured by three different methods, were evaluated. We recruited 4 COPD patients to determine if EB-OCT could identify peripheral airway remodeling. Results: The 4 parameters, measured by CT and EB-OCT, correlated significantly [D(mean) (r = 0.991), Ai (r = 0.997), Aw (r = 0.997), Aw% (r = 0.991), all P < 0.01]. Significant correlation were found for these parameters, measured by histology and EB-OCT, from the 3rd to 5th generation bronchi [D(mean) (r = 0.989), Ai (r = 0.997), Aw (r = 0.999), Aw% (r = 0.988), all P < 0.01], and from the 6th to 9th generation bronchi [D(mean) (r = 0.979), Ai (r = 0.997), Aw (r = 0.994) and Aw% (r = 0.988), all P < 0.01].

Furthermore it was quite difficult to place endotracheal tube, especially in younger children undergoing oral procedure. We examined the correlation among classification of mandibular hypoplasia (Pruzansky classification), the fusion of cervical spines and the degrees of difficulty in intubation for 16 patients who had had radiographs of skull, but we found no correlation among them. But in all the 3 patients with the fusion of cervical spines, intubation was difficult. Therefore, we must perform radiographic assessment of the fusion of the cervical spine.",0,0

26691626,Myofunctional therapy applied to upper airway resistance syndrome: a case report,"The literature presents publications on the treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) by myofunctional therapy, but there are no reports of this approach to patients with upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS). The objective was to verify the effect of myofunctional therapy in a case of UARS in relation to morphological and functional aspects of the stomatognathic system, anthropometric data, and quality of sleep. Patient, aged 61 years, diagnosed with UARS, underwent 12 sessions of myofunctional therapy for 3 months with exercises aimed at the suprahyoid, the tongue, and the soft palate muscles. Evaluations were performed before the start of the therapeutic process, right after the end, as well as 1, 2, 4, and 10 months after the completion of the treatment, considering: tonicity and mobility of the suprahyoid muscles, the tongue, and the soft palate; modified Mallampati grade; neck circumference; body mass index; and parameters of sleep quality. After the therapeutic process, there was a decrease in scores related to the tonus of the suprahyoid muscles, mobility, and tonus of the tongue and of the soft palate. The Mallampati grade was IV in the initial evaluation, and III in subsequent assessment. There was a reduction of 2 cm in neck circumference and BMI remained similar over time. In analyzing the three parameters of sleep quality, improvement was observed in all evaluations after discharge. Therefore, the effect of myofunctional therapy in a case of UARS was positive for all parameters.",0,0
26154460,Craniofacial changes and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing in healthy children,"Introduction: The main cause of mouth breathing and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in childhood is associated with upper airway narrowing to varying degrees. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of morphological and functional craniofacial changes and the main clinical symptoms of SDB in healthy children. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted. A sample comprising 687 healthy schoolchildren, aged 7-12 years old and attending public schools, was assessed by medical history, clinical medical and dental examination, and respiratory tests. The self-perceived quality of life of mouth breathing children was obtained by a validated questionnaire. Results: Out of the total sample, 520 children were nose breathers (NB) while 167 (24.3%) were mouth breathers (MB); 32.5% had severe hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils, 18% had a Mallampati score of III or IV, 26.1% had excessive overjet and 17.7% had anterior open bite malocclusion. Among the MB, 53.9% had atresic palate, 35.9% had lip incompetence, 33.5% reported sleepiness during the day, 32.2% often sneezed, 32.2% had a stuffy nose, 19.6% snored, and 9.4% reported having the feeling to stop breathing while asleep. However, the self-perception of their quality of life was considered good. Conclusion: High prevalence of facial changes as well as signs and symptoms of mouth breathing were found among health children, requiring early diagnosis and treatment to reduce the risk of SDB.",0,0
19915475,The supraglottic airway I-gel in comparison with ProSeal laryngeal mask airway and classic laryngeal mask airway in anaesthetized patients,"Background and objective: The I-gel is a new single-use supraglottic airway device without an inflatable cuff. This study was designed to investigate the usefulness of the I-gel compared with the classic laryngeal mask airway (cLMA) and ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (pLMA) in anaesthetized, paralysed patients. Methods: The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients (n = 167) scheduled for orthopaedic surgery were included in this prospective study. General anaesthesia was achieved with intravenous infusion of propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium. The patients were randomly assigned to I-gel, pLMA and cLMA groups (64, 53 and 50 patients, respectively). Properly sized I-gel (No. 3-4) or LMA (No. 4-5) was inserted. We assessed haemodynamic data, airway leak pressure, leak volume, success rates and postoperative complications. Results: There were no differences in the demographic data and haemodynamic data immediately after insertion of devices among the three groups. The airway leak pressures of the I-gel group (27.1 +/- 6.4 cmH2O) and pLMA group (29.8 +/- 5.7 cmH2O) were significantly higher than that of the cLMA group (24.7 +/- 6.2 cmH2O). The success rates for first attempt of insertion were similar among the three groups (P = 0.670). There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events except for the larger incidence of sore throat in the cLMA group. Conclusion: I-gel may have a similar airway sealing to that of pLMA, higher than that of cLMA, and is not associated with adverse events. The I-gel might be an effective alternative as a supraglottic airway device.",0,0
23462579,Extrinsic bronchial obstruction caused by scoliosis,"Study design: A case report. Objective: To emphasize the importance of monitoring the breathing capacity in patients with moderate to severe scoliosis, even in adulthood. Summary of background data: Diseases that disturb the structure of the chest wall affect the function of the respiratory pump. Restrictive respiratory pattern is caused by severe scoliosis. However, scoliosis may provoke obstructive changes due to compression of the airways. It can be a direct compression because of imprinting of vertebral bodies, or an indirect one, due to rotation forces. METHODS.: We have collected data from the patients' clinical history and have reviewed similar published cases. Case presentation: a white female, with frequent respiratory tract infections during her childhood. She was diagnosed as having 55° right T5-T11 scoliosis. At age of 26, an increase of her pulmonary symptoms appeared with difficulty to expel mucus and medium efforts dyspnea. A computed axial tomographic scan showed T8 vertebral body pushing against the right intermediate bronchus. A bronchoscopy found a decrease in the bronchial area, with near contact between the walls. Lung function test: 41% forced vital capacity (FVC), 43% forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and 91 FEV1/FVC1. The patient underwent surgical correction using rods and pedicle screws; she had improvement of symptoms, image tests, and pulmonary function (70% FVC, 71% FEV1, and 101 FEV1/FVC). Conclusion: Increased frequency and severity of respiratory tract infections, difficulty in expelling mucus and dyspnea are warning signs of compromised airways. Spirometry tests and image tests such as computed axial tomography and bronchoscopy are essential for diagnosis. Surgical approach may be the treatment of choice.",0,0

19468563,[Bilateral blockade of the pudend nerve to hemorrhoidectomy in achondroplasic patient: case report],"Background and objectives: The achondroplasic dwarfism or achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism and occurs, in most of the cases, as a result of spontaneous genetic alteration. The anesthesia in these patients presents several particularities. The objective of the present report was to describe an achondroplasic patient case, with a previous history of surgical procedure of the vertebral column for medullar decompression, submitted to haemorrhoidectomy through the bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves. Case report: Male patient, 47 years old, achondroplasic, hospitalized to perform hemorrhoidectomy. Upon physical examination, he presented a shortened neck with limited extension of the head, Mallampati class IV, thyromental distance of 6 cm and opening of the mouth of 3.5 cm. The vertebral column presented thoracic kyphosis and severe lumbar lordosis, in addition to a surgical scar in the lumbar region. A bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves was performed with ropivacaine at 1%, via transperineal, with isolated needle measuring 0.8 mm x 100 mm 21G (Stimuplex A100 BBraun, Melsungen, Germany) connected to the peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex-DIG, BBraun).The patient was positioned in ventral decubitus and the surgery started after 15 minutes of anesthetic administration. During the entire procedure, the patient remained conscious and did not report pain or discomfort. Up to the moment his hospital discharge (22 hours after the performance of the blockade), the patient did not mention pain, discomfort, nausea, vomit, motor blockade, urinary retention or incontinence. After his discharge from the hospital, he evolved well presenting evacuation after 31 hours from surgery. Conclusions: The case illustrated the use of the bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves, with the help of the neurostimulator, as an isolated anesthetic techniques for hemorrhoidectomy.",0,0
2644052,Laryngoscope design and the difficult adult tracheal intubation,"Clinical examination of a patient is very likely to reveal the factors making tracheal intubation difficult and thus increasing the likelihood of a traumatized temporo-mandibular joint or mouth. Although laryngoscopes and bronchoscopes incorporating fiberoptic visual devices are invaluable they are usually only employed for extremely difficult patients. Other laryngoscopes exist in a variety of designs and can be categorised according to the particular problem they address: (i) prominent sternal region, (ii) narrow space between the incisors, (iii) reduced intraoral space and, (iv) the anteriorly positioned larynx. An atraumatic tracheal intubation will be assisted if the laryngoscope blade to be used is selected on the basis of the anatomic difficulties prescribed by the patient. The Miller, Jackson-Wisconsin, Macintosh, Soper, Bizarri-Guffrida, and Bainton blades together with appropriate handles and fittings comprise a group from which selection can be made.",0,0
25199334,[General anesthesia for a pregnant patient with PAPA syndrome],"A 31-year-old female, with 22 weeks of pregnancy, presented with sudden onset of severe headache. CT scan showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. A cerebral angiogram showed dissecting aneurysm of right cerebral artery. To obliterate the aneurysm and prevent rupture, the patient underwent coil embolization via an endovascular approach under general anesthesia because the procedure under sedation with local anesthesia was too risky for re-bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed as PAPA syndrome. Although the arthritis was now stable and she was taking no drug, remarkable osteoarthritis was observed. The cervical spine X ray demonstrated no cervical ankylosis. As patient was sedated with propofol, airway examination could not be done except noticing thyromental distance of seven centimeters. Patient's trachea was intubated using Macintosh size #3 laryngoscope blade and a 7.0 non-styletted tracheal tube at the first attempt without any problems (Cormack grade I). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, fentanyl and remifentanil. After the end of endovascular surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation. She was weaned from mechanical ventilation 2 days later but consciousness was unclear. Right incomplete paralysis was also observed. MRI revealed vasospasm on the bilateral internal carotid artery. The patient underwent percutaneous tansluminalangioplasty coil and intraarterial injection of fasudil hydrochloride under local anesthesia. The consciousness recovered fully and the paralysis was improved.

18507649,Sputum neurokinin A in Egyptian asthmatic children and adolescents: relation to exacerbation severity,"Background: Neurogenic inflammation may participate in the development and progression of bronchial asthma. The molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenic inflammation are orchestrated by a large number of neuropeptides including tachykinins such as neurokinin A (NKA) and substance P. Tachykinins are secreted from sensory airway nerves and inflammatory cells after allergens exposure. In clinical practice, assessment of airway inflammation is difficult. Therefore, detection of biological markers of airway inflammation in sputum might offer help for proper monitoring of asthma severity. Aim of the study: We aimed to measure sputum NKA in relation to acute asthma exacerbations of varying severity. Methods: Sputum NKA was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 24 children and adolescents during and after acute asthma exacerbation and 24 healthy matched controls. Results: Sputum NKA was significantly higher in asthmatic patients during acute exacerbation than controls [217.5 (284) vs 10 (7) ng/ml, P < 0.001]. When patients with acute asthma exacerbation were followed-up till remission, sputum NKA levels decreased significantly, but they remained significantly higher than controls. Sputum NKA levels were significantly higher in severe than moderate and in moderate than mild exacerbations, and was negatively correlated to peak expiratory flow rate (r = -0.9, P < 0.001). Sputum NKA had significant positive correlations to eosinophil counts in blood and sputum (r = 0.6, P < 0.001 and r = 0.7, P < 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: Sputum NKA is up-regulated during acute asthma exacerbation and it positively correlates to its severity. Thus, NKA may aid in objective classification of the exacerbation severity. In addition, NKA may be a target for new asthma therapy.",0,0
19293691,"Prediction and outcomes of impossible mask ventilation: a review of 50,000 anesthetics","Background: There are no existing data regarding risk factors for impossible mask ventilation and limited data regarding its incidence. The authors sought to determine the incidence, predictors, and outcomes associated with impossible mask ventilation. Methods: The authors performed an observational study over a 4-yr period. For each adult patient undergoing a general anesthetic, preoperative patient characteristics, detailed airway physical exam, and airway outcome data were collected. The primary outcome was impossible mask ventilation defined as the inability to exchange air during bag-mask ventilation attempts, despite multiple providers, airway adjuvants, or neuromuscular blockade. Secondary outcomes included the final, definitive airway management technique and direct laryngoscopy view. The incidence of impossible mask ventilation was calculated. Independent (P < 0.05) predictors of impossible mask ventilation were identified by performing a logistic regression full model fit. Results: Over a 4-yr period from 2004 to 2008, 53,041 attempts at mask ventilation were recorded. A total of 77 cases of impossible mask ventilation (0.15%) were observed. Neck radiation changes, male sex, sleep apnea, Mallampati III or IV, and presence of beard were identified as independent predictors. The receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve for this model was 0.80 +/- 0.03. Nineteen impossible mask ventilation patients (25%) also demonstrated difficult intubation, with 15 being intubated successfully. Twelve patients required an alternative intubation technique, including two surgical airways and two patients who were awakened and underwent successful fiberoptic intubation. Conclusions: Impossible mask ventilation is an infrequent airway event that is associated with difficult intubation. Neck radiation changes represent the most significant clinical predictor of impossible mask ventilation in the patient dataset.",1,1
24810379,[French national survey on difficult intubation in intensive care units],"Objectives: Assessing the theoretical knowledge, practical experience of French intensivists, and their compliance with French Anesthesiology and Critical Care Society's difficult airway algorithms of the expert's SFAR conference of 2006. Study design: Prospective and descriptive national survey. Material and methods: An anonymous questionnaire with 40 questions was emailed to physicians working in intensive care units in France. Results: Five hundred and eight intensivists answered the survey. Ninety-seven percent of physicians reported having a portable storage unit for difficult intubation. As for practical experience, 421 physicians (83 %) have set up less than 10 laryngeal mask airway, 257 (51 %) have performed less than 10 intubations under fibroscopy and 269 (53 %) have never performed a cricothyroidotomy on mannequin, and 331 (65 %) on a patient. In case of emergency intubation, 29 % of them do not use a rapid sequence induction. Three hundred physicians (59 %) use capnography as monitoring of the endotracheal position. Two hundred and nine (42 %) consider they have not been trained to difficult intubation and 443 (87 %) would like to participate in high fidelity simulations mannequin. Conclusions: National airway management algorithm was insufficiently followed. Alternative techniques do not seem to be mastered by all physicians.

19857270,Successful establishment of primary small airway cell cultures in human lung transplantation,"Background: The study of small airway diseases such as post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is hampered by the difficulty in assessing peripheral airway function either physiologically or directly. Our aims were to develop robust methods for sampling small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and to establish submerged SAEC cultures for downstream experimentation. Methods: SAEC were obtained at 62 post-transplant bronchoscopies in 26 patients using radiologically guided bronchial brushings. Submerged cell cultures were established and SAEC lineage was confirmed using expression of clara cell secretory protein (CCSP). Results: The cell yield for SAEC (0.956 +/- 0.063 x 106) was lower than for large airway cells (1.306 +/- 0.077 x 106) but did not significantly impact on the culture establishment rate (79.0 +/- 5.2% vs. 83.8 +/- 4.7% p = 0.49). The presence of BOS significantly compromised culture success (independent of cell yield) for SAEC (odds ratio (95%CI) 0.067 (0.01-0.40)) but not LAEC (0.3 (0.05-1.9)). Established cultures were successfully passaged and expanded. Conclusion: Primary SAEC can be successfully obtained from human lung transplant recipients and maintained in culture for downstream experimentation. This technique will facilitate the development of primary in vitro models for BOS and other diseases with a small airway component such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD.",0,0
17898397,A two-dimensional model of anatomic relationships during laryngoscopy,"Background: The view obtained during direct laryngoscopy is only seen by a single anesthesiologist. The inability of instructors to observe the view poses problems for teaching the technique. The anatomic interactions affecting laryngoscopy are largely internal, hampering efforts to understand why some patients are unexpectedly difficult to intubate. In response, we have constructed a full scale, adjustable, two-dimensional model showing the head and neck in the sagittal plane. In this article, we validate the mannequin and test how various conditions or changes in equipment affect the laryngoscopic view. Methods: Model parameters were compared with literature values. Glottic exposure was evaluated over a range of jaw lengths and interincisor gaps for Macintosh 3, Miller 2, and Macintosh 4 blades. Results: Thirty segmental airway distances and 10 angles were within 1 standard deviation from published values. Spine and jaw mobilities approximated normal range of motion. Glottic exposure decreased steeply for mouth openings below a threshold. A larger mouth opening was required to obtain a view when the mandible was short. None of the blades exposed the glottis when mouth opening was narrow, 2.4 cm. The Macintosh 4 blade was closest to success, within 7 mm of viewing the posterior cords. Conclusions: The model reflects an average 16-yr-old male patient in size, proportion, and mobility. It can be used to explicate how anatomic relationships affect laryngoscopy. An objective assessment is necessary to determine the model's utility for teaching and as a tool for researching the mechanisms responsible for laryngoscopic difficulty.",0,0
26794330,[The relationship between passive rhinomanometry measurements in sitting and supine position and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome],"Objectives: This study aims to investigate the possible relationship between passive rhinomanometry measurements in sitting and supine position and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Patients and methods: Between January 2011 and December 2013, 88 male patients (mean age 46.8 years; range 18 to 79 years) underwent passive rhinomanometry in sitting and supine position following history, physical examination and fiberoptic endoscopic examination. 1.5 lt/sn air flow was pumped into the nose of each patient via a silicone nasal mask. Meanwhile, flow and pressure values were measured. Results: There was no correlation between the resistance values and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) scores and polysomnography and physical examination parameters (p>0.05). The differential resistance was correlated with AHI (r=0.325, p<0.05), body mass index (r=0.324, p<0.05), neck circumference (r=0.421, p<0.01), waist circumference (r=0.444, p<0.01), modified Mallampati score (r=0.356, p<0.05), and retropalatal grade (r=0.438, p<0.01). Conclusion: The correlation between the differential resistance and physical examination parameters and AHI scores support the hypothesis that position-related retropalatal segment alterations can be measured by passive rhinomanometry while awake.",0,0
25430446,Application of a new combined model including radiological indicators to predict difficult airway in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis,"Background: Airway management is crucial in clinical anesthesia. Many complications associated with airway management result from unexpected difficult airway, but predicting a difficult airway is a major challenge. We investigated the efficacy of a new combined model including radiological indicators to predict difficult airway in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis, a population with a high incidence of difficult airway. Methods: We randomly enrolled 303 patients scheduled for elective surgery for cervical spondylosis at Peking University Third Hospital between August 2012 and March 2013. Preoperatively, patients were evaluated for difficult airway according to a clinical index and parameters on lateral cervical radiographs and magnetic resonance images. Difficult airway was defined as Cormack-Lehane grades III-IV. Logistic regression was used to identify a combined (clinical and radiological) model for difficult airway. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to describe the effectiveness of prediction. Results: We identified three clinical predictive factors using the ROC curve: mouth opening, sternomental distance, and neck mobility. We created a clinical model using three factors: gender, age, and mouth opening, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.370, 1.034, and 0.358, respectively. Using the clinical and radiological parameters, we formulated a combined model with five risk factors: gender, mouth opening, atlanto-occipital gap, the angle from the second to sixth cervical vertebraes in the neutral position, and the angle difference of d (the angle between the laryngeal axis and the epiglottic axis) from the neutral position to extension (OR: 0.107, 0.355, 0.846, 1.057, and 0.952, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of the combined model were 80.0% and 65.7%, respectively, and the ROC curve confirmed that the combined model was better than any single clinical predictor and the clinical model. Conclusion: The efficacy of the combined model including both clinical and radiological indicators was better than any single clinical predictor or the clinical model in patients undergoing elective surgery for cervical spondylosis.",0,0

15578472,Difficult intubation in pediatric cardiac anesthesia,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate cases of difficult intubation in pediatric cardiac surgical patients and to evaluate the importance of associated congenital abnormalities. Design: Retrospective analysis. Setting: Departments of Anesthesiology and Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery of a tertiary university hospital. Participants: All children undergoing congenital heart surgery. Interventions: Patients who had difficult intubations according to their anesthetic charts were further evaluated from hospital files for demographic characteristics, associated congenital abnormalities, and perioperative airway and/or respiratory complications. Measurements and main results: A total of 1,278 pediatric patients with congenital heart disease were operated on from January 1999 to July 2002. Difficult intubation was encountered in 16 cases (1.25%). Two of these were newborns, 11 were infants, and 3 were in the pediatric age group. Anterior larynx was the most common reason for difficult intubation (7 cases, 43.7%). There were associated syndromes and/or other congenital abnormalities in 8 children (50%). Conclusion: The likelihood of difficult intubation during pediatric cardiac surgery, especially in cases with other congenital pathologies should be kept in mind, and the anesthetic approach must be planned accordingly.",0,0
15753502,"Modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance and inter-incisor gap are the best predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in West Africans","Purpose: To determine the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx (DVL) from the following preoperative airway predictive indices, in isolation and combination: modified Mallampati test (MMT), thyromental distance (TMD), sternomental distance (SMD), horizontal length of the mandible (HLM) and inter-incisor gap (IIG). Methods: Three hundred and eighty consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia were evaluated using the MMT, TMD, SMD, HLM and IIG and the cut-off points for the airway predictors were Mallampati III and IV; < or = 6.5 cm, < or = 13.5 cm, < or = 9.0 cm and < or = 4.0 cm respectively. During direct laryngoscopy, the laryngeal view was graded using the Cormack and Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult visualization. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of DVL. Results: Difficulty to visualize the larynx was found in 13 (3.4%) patients. The sensitivity, specificity and the positive predictive value for the five airway predictors were: MMT (61.5%; 98.4%; 57.1%), TMD (15.4%; 98.1%; 22.2%), SMD (0%; 100%; 0%), HLM (30.8%, 76.0%; 4.3%) and IIG (30.8%; 97.3%; 28.6%). The best combination of predictors was MMT/TMD/IIG with a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 84.6%; 94.6%; 35.5% respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that weight, MMT, IIG and TMD were independent predictors of DVL. Conclusion: MMT, TMD and IIG appear to provide the optimal combination in prediction of DVL in a West African population.",1,1
10941589,Teaching airway management skills. How and what to learn and teach,"It is important to instruct all individuals involved in patient care in airway management. The degree of skills actually taught depends on the student. Currently, there are many options for teaching. Mannequin training is the one best suited to instruct a large number of students in a variety of skills. Training of surgical and obstetric residents improves relations, may improve patient safety, and educates these individuals regarding the risks of failed intubation. Actual clinical decisions regarding patient management are based on the airway examination. There is room for improvement in instruction, even in anesthesiology programs.

15781548,The chewing of betel quid and oral submucous fibrosis and anesthesia,"Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a premalignant lesion of the buccal mucosa caused by chewing betel quid. It results in progressive inability to open the mouth. OSMF causes difficulty in laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea. Patients with OSMF require anesthesia for trismus correction, resection, and reconstructive (oncoplastic) surgery for coexisting oral malignancies or other unrelated surgeries. Our review of the anesthetics of 44 patients with oral malignancies suggested that 8 had OSMF. The preoperative airway assessment, including the Mallampati score and the clinical Tumor Node Metastasis stage, were useful in predicting the need for fiberoptic intubation. Patients with oral malignancies and OSMF had increased requirement for fiberoptic endotracheal intubations (62.5%) compared with those without OSMF (44.4%). Three different techniques of airway management (tracheal intubation after direct laryngoscopy, fiberoptic tracheal intubation, and tracheostomy) in four patients with OSMF are described.

Hereby, we report a case of CAS in a child undergoing complete dental restoration under GA after receiving a small dose of atropine to reverse hypoxia induced bradycardia. Intraoperative events such as hypoxia or cardiac arrest may play a role as triggers for CAS. However, we cannot establish a causal relationship between the occurrence of CAS and such critical events.",0,0
8595696,Evaluation of the Augustine Guide for difficult tracheal intubation,"Successful tracheal intubation with Augustine Guide (Augustine Medical, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN) in patients with normal airways has recently been described. There are no studies describing Augustine Guide (AG) use in patients with difficult airways. Accordingly, we studied AG intubation in a population of patients with expected difficult airways due to cervical spine pathology, limited mouth opening, obesity, facial trauma or deformity due to previous operation or radiation and in patients with unexpectedly difficult airways. A total of 44 patients were studied. The AG was used as a primary intubating tool in patients with known difficult airways (n = 36) and as a secondary intubating tool in patients with unexpected inability to intubate using conventional direct laryngoscopy (n = 8). Airway difficulty was predicted by history and physical examination. Intubations were performed under general anaesthesia in 40 of the 44 patients studied. In four patients with predictably difficult airways, topical anaesthesia and sedation were used. Backup methods to achieve intubation were available. Thirty-two of the 36 with known or suspected difficult airways were classified as Mallampati Class III or IV. In the remaining eight patients the preoperative examination suggested an easy airway; however, after induction of general anaesthesia, their laryngeal inlet could not be seen using direct laryngoscopy. Using the AG, all were intubated successfully (36/44 at the first attempt, in 8/44 repositioning of the AG to allow successful laryngeal entry of the stylet was necessary). There were no failures or complications secondary to AG use. This study shows that the AG is a useful device for oral tracheal intubation in patients with known or unexpectedly difficult airways.",0,0
9618131,Investigative techniques in the assessment of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia,"Oral-pharyngeal dysphagia is a common problem with a high morbidity and mortality. In general, it is not managed as well as esophageal dysphagia by gastroenterologists. A number of techniques are now available for the assessment of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia. However, a careful clinical assessment followed by a video barium swallow is all that is required for the diagnosis and management in the majority of patients. Pharyngeal manometry is likely to play an increasingly important role in the assessment of difficult or atypical cases in whom it can provide functional information not achievable with videoradiography alone. Videolaryngoscopy is a quick and simple way of detecting structural lesions and of assessing deglutitive airway protection. Videolaryngoscopy is non-invasive and easily performed in an office setting. Ultrasonography is a convenient way of assessing lingual function, but provides no more information than the video barium swallow. Pharyngeal scintigraphy is likely to assume a greater clinical relevance as a means of quantifying swallow efficiency and response to therapy.",0,0
3171121,Evaluating anatomical factors affecting endotracheal intubation,"Critically ill patients often require endotracheal intubation in the emergency department. Sometimes immediate attempts at endotracheal intubation are indicated. In other situations, a momentary delay to assess the anatomic factors that might make intubation difficult is advantageous. This examination should include assessment of nose and oral cavity patency, mobility and posterior depth of the mandible, and mobility and length of the neck.",0,0
24353862,Nasal obstruction and palate-tongue position on sleep-disordered breathing,"Objectives: We wanted to evaluate whether the presence of nasal obstruction makes a change on the association between the modified Mallampati score and the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and the sleep quality. Methods: Polysomnography (PSG), the modified Mallampati score (MMS), the body-mass index, and a questionnaire about nasal obstruction were acquired from 275 suspected SDB patients. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the presence of nasal obstruction. The clinical differences between the two groups were evaluated and the associations between the MMS and PSG variables in each group were also assessed. Results: Significant correlations were found between the MMS and many PSG variables, including the apnea-hypopnea index, the arousal index and the proportion of deep sleep, for the patients with nasal obstruction, although this was not valid for the total patients or the patients without nasal obstruction. Conclusion: The severity of SDB and the quality of sleep are well correlated with the MMS, and especially for the patients with nasal obstruction. The MMS can give more valuable information about the severity of SDB when combined with simple questions about nasal obstruction.",0,0
18646710,[The target plasma concentration of propofol required to induce electroencephalography burst suppression with target-controlled infusion],"Objective: To determine the optimal target plasma concentration of propofol required to induce EEG burst suppression administered by TCI in order to decrease cerebral metabolic rate and increase tolerance to cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. Methods: One hundred and fifty ASA I-II patients(aged 18-55 years-old, BMI < 30, Mallampati Score I-II) scheduled for elective surgery undergoing general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. Patients with systemic diseases or other factors effecting the electrical activity of brain were excluded. ECG, IBP, SpO2, PetCO2, Temperature and EEG (two-channel referential montage system) were continuously monitored during the procedure. Patients were induced with TCI propofol (the target plasma concentration was initially set at 5.4 microg/ml), After induction and intubation, target plasma concentration was increased by 0.3 microg/ml increment and sustained 15 minutes until EEG burst suppression appeared(stable burst suppression waveform and BSR > 50%), and this target concentration was recorded. Results: The mean target plasma concentration of propofol with TCI required to induce EEG burst suppression was 6.1 +/- 0.6 microg/ml with 95% confidence interval of 5.99-6.19 microg/ml. There was no significant difference between the genders. Conclusions: The target plasma concentration of propofol reached 6.2 microg/ml can induce EEG burst suppression, which is better for intraoperative cerebral protection.",0,0
8104675,Rhythmic delta-frequency activities in the nucleus accumbens of anesthetized and freely moving rats,"In urethane-anesthetized rats, a membrane potential oscillation (MPO) of up to 30 mV and 0.5-2 Hz (delta frequency range) was found in neurons of the nucleus accumbens. The membrane potential oscillations were of similar frequency and reversed in phase to the extracellular EEG of about 0.5 mV. In freely moving rats, a rhythmic delta EEG of 0.5-3 Hz was found in the nucleus accumbens, and it was of highest amplitude and regularity during awake immobility and face washing, less regular during slow wave sleep, and of the lowest amplitude during body and head movements and rapid eye movement sleep. The behavioural relation of the accumbens EEG was not critically affected after amphetamine, haloperidol, and parachlorophenylalanine, which depleted serotonin, although the accumbens EEG during awake immobility was less regular after blocking muscarinic cholinergic receptors by atropine sulfate. However, stimulation of the ventral tegmental area suppressed the accumbens delta membrane potential oscillations and EEG, and this effect was antagonized by haloperidol, suggesting that endogenous dopamine release may suppress the accumbens delta rhythm. It was concluded that the delta rhythm in the nucleus accumbens may represent a state of bilateral synchrony among accumbens neurons that is perhaps characteristic of an idling system, while desynchronization of the delta rhythm may occur closely with motor action.",0,0
20049576,Rapid sequence induction for appendectomies: a retrospective case-review analysis,"Purpose: Rapid sequence induction (RSI) with cricoid pressure is suggested to decrease the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. However, the effectiveness of RSI has been questioned, and the technique may lead to airway and hemodynamic complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of RSI use in patients with acute appendicitis, the types of drugs administered, and the occurrence of any complications. Methods: After approval by the Ethics Committee, the charts of patients undergoing appendectomy in a one-year period were examined retrospectively. Information was retrieved on Mallampati airway evaluation, airway device used, preoxygenation, RSI, and drugs at induction. Reported complications were noted, including airway difficulties, hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) and hypertension (>160 mmHg) in the 20-min period after induction. Results: General anesthesia with tracheal intubation was used in 248 of 250 cases reviewed. The Mallampati airway evaluation, preoxygenation, and RSI were recorded as performed in 95, 94, and 81% of cases, respectively. Opioids, propofol, and neuromuscular blocking agents were given in 98, 98, and 99% of patients, respectively. Succinylcholine use was common (80%), with 96% of these patients receiving rocuronium precurarization. Difficult intubation with successful alternate technique was encountered in three patients (1.2%). Hypotension and hypertension occurred in 27% and 8% of patients, respectively. There were no documented cases of aspiration. Oxygen desaturation was mentioned in one case at induction and in three cases at emergence. Conclusion: An RSI with opioid, induction agent, and succinylcholine is the technique of choice for appendectomies at our institution. The frequency of airway complications is too low to recommend a change in practice.",1,1
23918003,Postoperative laryngeal symptoms in a general surgery setting. Clinical study,"Introduction: Vocal cord injuries (VI), postoperative hoarseness (PH), dysphonia (DN), dysphagia (DG) and sore throat (ST) are common complications after general anesthesia; there is actually a lack of consensus to support the proper timing for post-operative laryngoscopy that is reliable to support the diagnosis of laryngeal or vocal fold lesions after surgery and there are no valid studies about the entity of laryngeal trauma in oro-tracheal intubation. Aim of our study is to evaluate the statistical relation between anatomic, anesthesiological and surgical variables in the case of PH, DG or impaired voice register. Materials and methods: 50 patients (30 thyroidectomies, 8 videolaparoscopic cholecistectomies, 2 right emicolectomies, 2 left emicolectomies, 1 gastrectomy, 1 hemorrhoidectomy, 1 nefrectomy, 1 diagnostic videothoracoscopy, 1 superior right lung lobectomy, 1 appendicectomy, 1 incisional hernia repair, 1 low anterior rectal resection, 1 radical hysterectomy) underwent clinical evaluation and direct laryngoscopy before surgery, within 6 hours, after 72 hours and after 30 days, to evaluate motility and breathing space, phonatory motility, true and false vocal folds and arytenoids oedema. We evaluated also mean age (56.6 ± 3.6 years), male:female ratio (1:1.5), cigarette smoke (20%), atopic comorbidity (17/50 = 34%), Mallampati class (32% 1, 38% 2, 26% 3, 2% 4), mean duration of intubation (159 minutes, range 50 - 405 minutes), Cormack-Lehane score (34% 1, 22% 2, 22% 3, 2% 4), difficult intubation in 9 cases (18%). No complication during the laryngoscopy were registered. We investigated the statistic relationship between pre and intraoperative variables and laryngeal symptoms and lesions. Results: In our experience, statistically significant relations were found in prevalence of vocal folds oedema in smokers (p < 0.005), self limiting DG and DN in younger patients (p < 0.005) and in thyroidectomy (p < 0.01), DG after thyroidectomy (p < 0.01). The short preoperative use of steroids and antihistaminic to prevent allergic reactions appears not related to reduction or prevention of DN, DG, PH and ST. No statistical relation in incidence of postoperative complications was found for the prolonged intubation, gastro-esophageal reflux, BURP manoeuvre (backward upward right sided pressure) and Mallampati and Cormack-Lehane class more than 2, maintenance with sevoflurane 2% and use of stilet. Conclusions: Direct laryngoscopy is essential for the detection of arytenoid lesions after orotracheal intubation for general anesthesia. In our opinion, a part of temporary post-operative DN or PH is due to monolateral or bilateral arytenoids oedema, secondary to prolonged or difficult orotracheal intubation, valuable with laryngoscopy 72 hours after surgery. Is necessary to adjunct these complications in the surgical informed consensus scheme.",0,0
25925037,Does ultrasonographic volume of the thyroid gland correlate with difficult intubation? An observational study,"Background and objectives: Preoperative ultrasonographic evaluation of the thyroid gland done by surgeons could let us foresee airway management challenges. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effects of thyroid-related parameters assessed preoperatively by surgeons via ultrasonography and chest X-ray on intubation conditions. Methods: Fifty patients undergoing thyroid surgery were enrolled. Thyromental distance, Mallampati score, neck circumference and range of neck movement were evaluated before the operation. Thyroid volume, signs of invasion or compression and tracheal deviation on chest X-ray were also noted. The intubation conditions were assessed with Cormack and Lehane score and the intubation difficulty scale. Statistical analyses were done with SPSS 15.0 software. Results: The mean thyroid volume of the patients was 26.38 ± 14 mL. The median intubation difficulty scale was 1 (0-2). Thyromental distance (p = 0.011; r = 0.36; 95% CI 0.582-0.088), Mallampati score (p = 0.041; r = 0.29; 95% CI 0.013-0.526), compression or invasion signs (p = 0.041; r = 0.28; 95% CI 0.006-0.521) and tracheal deviation on chest X-ray (p = 0.041; r = 0.52; 95% CI 0.268-0.702) were correlated with intubation difficulty scale. Also patients were classified into two groups related to their intubation difficulty scale (Group I, n = 19: intubation difficulty scale = 0; Group II, n = 31: 1< intubation difficulty scale ≤ 5) and difficult intubation predictors and thyroid-related parameters were compared. Only Mallampati score was significantly different between groups (p = 0.025). Conclusion: The thyroid volume is not associated with difficult intubation. However clinical assessment parameters may predict difficult intubation.",0,0
23588011,Emergency airway management: common ventilation techniques,"Maintaining a patient's airway and facilitating breathing are the main priorities during any emergency situation in which breathing is compromised. The key to safe management of an airway is thorough assessment, primarily to ensure the airway is patent. In an emergency situation, a bag-valve-mask may be the most effective way to assist ventilation. If ventilation is required for prolonged periods in an emergency situation, then endotracheal intubation should be performed. This involves the placement of a cuffed, endotracheal tube in the trachea, through which ventilation is maintained. Each tracheal intubation event should be anticipated as a potentially difficult intubation. Longer term ventilatory support may be achieved by the use of mechanical ventilators, which are designed to assist the movement of gases (air) into and out of a patient's lungs, while minimising the work and effort of breathing. This article provides nurses with an overview of the techniques and equipment that is most often used within emergency and intensive care units to maintain the patency of a patient's airway and provide ventilatory support.",0,0
7436242,Acute upper airway obstruction in infants and children. Evaluation by the fiberoptic bronchoscope,"All infants and children seen by the pediatric pulmonary service who display symptoms of upper airway obstruction undergo transnasal fiberoptic evaluation with the 3.2 mm flexible instrument. The procedure enables the observer to immediately visualize the nasopharynx, supraglottic, glottic and subglottic structures. Instrumentation is done in the sitting upright position and takes the skilled observer about 20 seconds to perform. The differentiation of epiglottitis from subglottic croup, foreign body aspiration and other less common causes of airway obstruction is easily performed and well tolerated. The fiberoptic instrument is often utilized both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. It can be utilized to intubate cases of epiglottitis and to evaluate the epiglottis to determine the appropriate time for extubation. This procedure is superior to oral airway examination because it does not distort airway anatomy, can be performed in the upright position, and does not further exacerbate airway obstruction.",0,0
19185869,Development and validation of a liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of capreomycin sulfate and its related substances,"A gradient LC method for the analysis of capreomycin sulfate and its related substances was developed.

12131113,The unexpected difficult airway and lingual tonsil hyperplasia: a case series and a review of the literature,"Background: An unexpected difficult intubation occurs because physical examination of the airway is imperfect in predicting it. Lingual tonsil hyperplasia (LTH) is one risk factor for an unanticipated failed intubation that is not detectable during a routine oropharyngeal examination. The authors attempted to determine the incidence of LTH in unanticipated failed intubation in patients subjected to general anesthesia. Methods: Thirty-three patients with unanticipated failed intubation via direct laryngoscopy were subjected to airway examinations and fiberoptic pharyngoscopy to determine the cause(s) of failure. Mouth opening, mandibular subluxation, head extension, thyromental distance, and Mallampati airway class were recorded. Fiberoptic pharyngoscopy was then performed to evaluate the base of the tongue and valleculae. Results: Of these 33 patients, none had an airway examination that suggested a difficult intubation. The lungs of 12 patients were difficult to ventilate by mask. In 15 patients, airway measurements were within normal limits with Mallampati class of I or II. Ten patients had a Mallampati class III airway, 6 associated with obesity and 5 with mildly limited head extension. Among the 5 morbidly obese patients, most of the weight was distributed on the lower trunk and body. The 3 remaining patients had a thyromental distance of 6 cm or less but otherwise had a normal airway examination. The only finding common to all 33 patients was LTH observed on fiberoptic pharyngoscopy. Conclusion: Lingual tonsil hyperplasia can interfere with rigid laryngoscopic intubation and face mask ventilation. Routine physical examination of the airway will not identify its presence. The prevalence of LTH in adults and the extent of its contribution to failed intubation is unknown.",0,0
19399488,Comparing three-dimensional volume-rendered CT images with fibreoptic tracheobronchoscopy in the evaluation of airway compression caused by tuberculous lymphadenopathy in children,"Background: Lymphobronchial tuberculosis (TB) causes airway compression in 38% of patients. The airway obstruction is conventionally assessed with fibreoptic tracheobronchoscopy (FTB). Multidetector-row spiral computed tomography (MDCT) with three-dimensional volume rendering (3-D VR) has significantly improved the imaging of the airways. No previous studies have assessed the accuracy of 3-D VR in determining the degree of airway compression in children due to TB lymphadenopathy. Objective: To compare 3-D VR CT to FTB for the assessment of airway compression due to TB lymphadenopathy in children. Materials and methods: Included in the study were 26 children presenting with symptoms of airway compression caused by pulmonary TB. MDCT of the chest and FTB were performed in all patients. Retrospective 3-D VR reconstruction of the major airways was performed from the original CT raw data and used to evaluate the tracheobronchial tree for site and degree of airway compression and then compared to the FTB findings. FTB was used as the reference standard Results: By FTB 87 sites of airway compression were identified. Using the 3-D VR technique, 138 sites of airway compression were identified, of which 78 (90%) matched with the sites identified by FTB. The sensitivity and specificity of 3-D VR when compared with that of FTB was 92% and 85%, respectively. In four patients (15%), severe narrowing of the bronchus intermedius made FTB evaluation of the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi impossible. VR demonstrated significant distal obstruction in three of these four patients Conclusion: 3-D VR demonstrates a very good correlation with FTB in determining airway compression caused by TB lymphadenopathy in children. In combination with FTB, 3-D VR adds confidence to the bronchoscopy findings and complements FTB by adding additional information on the status of the airway distal to severe obstructions unreachable by FTB.",0,0
2281854,[A modified Macintosh blade with an angulated tip for difficult intubations],"The depth of the proximal part of a normal Macintosh blade was carved more shallow and the tip of the blade was made adjustable in its angle by means of a joint controlled by a screw-lock fixation via a small wire parallel to the blade. Clinical experience with this modified blade in 33 patients is reported. In 10 of 13 patients with severely reduced mouth opening less than or equal to 25 mm and 19 of 20 patients with a mouth opening greater than 25 mm, visibility during laryngoscopy with the modified blade was improved, compared to the normal Macintosh blade.

1474628,The 1991 Fraser Gurd Lecture: evolution of airway control in the management of injured patients,"The evolution of methods for airway control has been an important factor in improving overall trauma care. Many important advances have been made in technique, tubes, and timing. Current methods of airway control are listed in Table 2 and are categorized as emergency or elective. It is always assumed that basic life support techniques will be in place before this hierarchic scheme for airway control is used. Unfortunately, hypoxemia continues to be a factor in preventable trauma deaths. There is much to be done in the future to further improve airway management in injured patients. There is an immediate need to assess methods of airway control in the pre-hospital phase using a randomized clinical trial. The ideal tube for cricothyroidotomy, tracheostomy, or endotracheal intubation remains to be designed. There is a need for further multicenter trials on the timing of tracheostomy in the critical care unit. The role of differential ventilators in the management of unilateral pulmonary parenchymal injury requires clinical validation. Intravascular membrane oxygenators have been proposed in advanced pulmonary insufficiency in a ventilated patient. Thus, while many important strides have been made in airway management following trauma, there remain great challenges in addressing the persistent problem of systemic hypoxemia after multiple injuries.",0,0
11811602,Airway management--when and how?,"Keeping the airway patent and protected is the crucial first step in resuscitation of collapsed patients. The patency of the airway can be maintained by head tilt, chin lift and jaw thrust, with or without the assistance of airway adjunct, for example oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways. Before securing definitive airway by endotracheal intubation, the degree of difficulty for intubation can be predicted using Mallampati, Cormack and Lehane classification. Laryngeal mask airway may have a role in resuscitation. A comprehensive training program must be in place to improve the success rate of the laryngeal mask airway insertion and reduce the complication rate associated with the placement of this device. In order to ensure survival of collapsed patients, all medical and nursing staff must know when and how to manage the airways. ""Do Not Resuscitate"" orders should be written for terminally ill patients to reduce futile resuscitation.",0,0
26343783,Endotracheal tube positioning during neck extension in thyroidectomy,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of body mass index and neck length on endotracheal tube movement during neck extension in thyroidectomy. Methods: A prospective study was conducted of 30 patients undergoing thyroidectomy during an 8-month period. Patient characteristics were recorded and endotracheal tube displacement was determined. Results: Mean body mass index was 27.8 kg/m2 (range, 17.5-34.7 kg/m2) and mean neck circumference was 43.2 cm (range, 28-56 cm). The mean (± standard deviation) upward displacement of the endotracheal tube during neck extension was 7.17 ± 5.87 mm. Patients with a larger body mass index had a significantly greater amount of tube displacement (R2 = 0.67, p < 0.0001), as did patients with a smaller neck length (R2 = 0.48, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Neck extension results in upward displacement of the endotracheal tube. The amount of displacement is significantly higher in patients with a larger body mass index or shorter neck length. This has particular relevance for nerve monitoring in thyroidectomy.",0,0

17087846,Fibre-optic intubation teaching in sedated patients with anticipated difficult intubation,"Background and objectives: The objective of the study was to assess the safety of training fibre-optic intubation performed under propofol light general anaesthesia in patients with an anticipated difficult intubation. Methods: Patients with ear, nose and throat cancer having at least two criteria for anticipated difficult intubation and scheduled for fibre-optic intubation were included prospectively. In 26 patients, intubation was performed by an anaesthesia resident (under senior supervision), whereas in 20 patients, it was performed by a senior anaesthesiologist. All patients received propofol light general anaesthesia adjusted to maintain both loss of consciousness and spontaneous ventilation. Results: Of the 46 patients, 45 had successful fibre-optic intubation, and one needed a rescue procedure because of hypoxaemia. Residents failed to intubate four patients, who were easily intubated by the senior. Episodic hypoxaemia (SPO2 < 90%) occurred in three patients in each group. No statistically significant difference was found between junior and senior neither on the duration of the procedure (9.3 +/- 4.9 vs. 7.5 +/- 4.0 min) nor on the propofol consumption (197 +/- 130 vs. 193 +/- 103 mg) or the ETCO2 at the end of the procedure (36 +/- 6 vs. 38 +/- 6 mmHg), respectively. Conclusion: Teaching fibre-optic tracheal intubation in patients with anticipated difficult intubation and sedated with propofol did not increase morbidity significantly compared with an experienced anaesthesiologist. Fibre-optic intubation under propofol light general anaesthesia could be safely performed by a resident as long as a senior anaesthesiologist is permanently present, spontaneous ventilation is maintained and a rescue oxygenation technique is immediately available.",0,0
11013469,The palm print as a sensitive predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in diabetics: a comparison with other airway evaluation indices,"Aims: To evaluate the ink impression made by the palm of the dominant hand as a screening tool for difficult laryngoscopy in diabetic patients. Subjects and methods: In this prospective study, airway of 50 adult diabetic patients, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia, was assessed preoperatively using the common clinical indices such as Modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance, degree of head extension and a specific index- the palm print test. Following induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular relaxation, laryngoscopy was performed and the laryngoscopic view scored. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of each airway evaluation index were calculated. Results: The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was 16%. The palm print test had the highest sensitivity (75%) of all the indices. The thyromental distance less than six cm had the highest specificity (95.2%) but was least sensitive (25%). 87% of patients with difficult laryngoscopy had two or more indices abnormal. Conclusion: Though the palm print test was the most sensitive index of the four indices studied, a better prediction of difficult laryngoscopy can be achieved by evaluating all the four airway indices preoperatively.",1,1
18543503,[Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope: experience in 350 cases],"Background: The aim of this study was to describe our experience in managing the new adult color model of the Lo-Pro GlideScope in a diverse group of patients. Material and methods: Prospective, descriptive study of 350 ASA 1-5 patients who underwent oral or nasal tracheal intubation with the Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope. Patients whose maximum mouth opening was inadequate were excluded. We recorded the following data: demographic variables, predictors of difficult direct laryngoscopy, Cormack-Lehane grade, presence of morbid obesity, adjusting maneuvers required, intubations in awake patients, intubations with a selective double lumen tube, rescues of failed intubations, oropharyngeal lesions, postoperative sore throat, and failed intubation. Results: Cormack-Lehane grade was 1 in 80.6% of the cases, 2 in 16.9%, and 3 in 2.6%. There were no Cormack-Lehane 4 patients. Rotation of the tube was necessary when entering the glottis in 38%. There were no significant differences in the incidence of oropharyngeal lesions between oral and nasal intubations. There were no abandoned attempts. Conclusions: The rate of successful tracheal intubation is high with the new Lo-Pro Adult Color GlideScope when it is used by trained staff, even in patients with difficult airways. It is also a useful device for intubating awake patients.",0,0
10793528,[Use of intubating laryngeal mask airway for three patients with difficult intubation],"We used intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILM) for three patients with difficult intubation, and tracheal intubation was successfully performed through the ILM in all three cases. Difficult intubation in the first case was caused by direct invasion of malignant lymphoma into the right maxillary sinus leading to restricted mouth opening. Neck stiffness due to invasion of metastatic cancer into the cervical spine in the second case and facial trauma caused by traffic accident in the third case gave rise to the difficult intubation. Insertion of the ILM was successfully performed in all the patients following induction of general anesthesia, and the ventilation through the ILM was possible without any difficulties. Subsequently, all patients were intubated through the ILM successfully. We realized that the ILM is useful and should be prepared on the induction of anesthesia in patients suspected of difficult intubation.",0,0
15805890,Sleep endoscopy versus modified Mallampati score in sleep apnea and snoring,"Objectives/hypothesis: The aim of this study is to quantify the correlation between a large tongue classified by the modified Mallampati score (MMS) and obstruction at the tongue base observed during sleep endoscopy in patients with socially unacceptable snoring (SUS) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Study design: Prospective. Methods: One hundred twenty-seven patients with obstructive sleep apnea and SUS underwent sleep endoscopy. Patients were classified into four specific groups according to their MMS. After intravenous administration of midazolam, obstructive events in the upper airway were classified. The level of obstruction was expressed as palatal (2), palatal and to a lesser degree base of the tongue/laryngeal level (2), tongue base/laryngeal level and to a lesser degree palatal (3), and tongue base/laryngeal level (3). The degree of correlation between the level of obstruction and the MMS was analyzed by means of Spearman's rank-order correlation. Results: No linear association between the level of obstruction and MMS could be found. A large tongue (MMS 3 or 4) does not predict obstruction at the base of the tongue. Patients classified as MMS 1 or 2 did not frequently show obstruction at the base of the tongue (9 of 38, 23,6%). The majority of the population showed retropalatal obstruction. A large tongue (MMS 3 or 4) was often accompanied by retropalatal obstruction, 76% of the cases (64 of 89). Conclusions: No positive correlation exists between a large tongue and obstruction at tongue base level. In both groups, retropalatal obstruction occurred more often than retrolingual obstruction.

21304457,A novel rescue technique for difficult intubation and difficult ventilation,"We describe a novel non surgical technique to maintain oxygenation and ventilation in a case of difficult intubation and difficult ventilation, which works especially well with poor mask fit. Can not intubate, can not ventilate"" (CICV) is a potentially life threatening situation. In this video we present a simulation of the technique we used in a case of CICV where oxygenation and ventilation were maintained by inserting an endotracheal tube (ETT) nasally down to the level of the naso-pharynx while sealing the mouth and nares for successful positive pressure ventilation. A 13 year old patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage of a neck abscess and direct laryngobronchoscopy. After preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced intravenously. Mask ventilation was found to be extremely difficult because of the swelling of the soft tissue. The face mask could not fit properly on the face due to significant facial swelling as well. A direct laryngoscopy was attempted with no visualization of the larynx. Oxygen saturation was difficult to maintain, with saturations falling to 80%. In order to oxygenate and ventilate the patient, an endotracheal tube was then inserted nasally after nasal spray with nasal decongestant and lubricant. The tube was pushed gently and blindly into the hypopharynx. The mouth and nose of the patient were sealed by hand and positive pressure ventilation was possible with 100% O2 with good oxygen saturation during that period of time. Once the patient was stable and well sedated, a rigid bronchoscope was introduced by the otolaryngologist showing extensive subglottic and epiglottic edema, and a mass effect from the abscess, contributing to the airway compromise. The airway was secured with an ETT tube by the otolaryngologist.This video will show a simulation of the technique on a patient undergoing general anesthesia for dental restorations.",0,0
25221769,"A comparison of between hyomental distance ratios, ratio of height to thyromental, modified Mallamapati classification test and upper lip bite test in predicting difficult laryngoscopy of patients undergoing general anesthesia","Background: Failed intubation is imperative source of anesthetic interrelated patient's mortality. The aim of this present study was to compare the ability to predict difficult visualization of the larynx from the following pre-operative airway predictive indices, in isolation and combination: Modified Mallampati test (MMT), the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD), hyomental distance ratios (HMDR), and the upper-lip-bite test (ULBT). Materials and methods: We collected data on 525 consecutive patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation and then evaluated all four factors before surgery. A skilled anesthesiologist, not imparted of the noted pre-operative airway assessment, did the laryngoscopy and rating (as per Cormack and Lehane's classification). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for every airway predictor in isolation and in combination were established. Results: The most sensitive of the single tests was ULBT with a sensitivity of 90.2%. The hyomental distance extreme of head extension was the least sensitive of the single tests with a sensitivity of 56.9. The HMDR had sensitivity 86.3%. The ULBT had the highest negative predictive value: And the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC curve) among single predictors. The AUC of ROC curve for ULBT, HMDR and RHTMD was significantly more than for MMT (P < 0.05). No significant difference was noted in the AUC of ROC curve for ULBT, HMDR, and RHTMD (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The HMDR is comparable with RHTMD and ULBT for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in the general population, but was significantly more than for MMT.",1,1
25540067,Advanced airway management is necessary in prehospital trauma patients,"Background: Treatment of airway compromise in trauma patients is a priority. Basic airway management is provided by all emergency personnel, but the requirement for on-scene advanced airway management is controversial. We attempted to establish the demand for on-scene advanced airway interventions. Trauma patients managed with standard UK paramedic airway interventions were assessed to determine whether airway compromise had been effectively treated or whether more advanced airway management was required. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted to identify trauma patients requiring prehospital advanced airway management attended by a doctor-paramedic team. The team assessed and documented airway compromise on arrival, interventions performed before and after their arrival, and their impact on airway compromise. Results: Four hundred and seventy-two patients required advanced airway intervention and received 925 airway interventions by ground-based paramedics. Two hundred and sixty-nine patients (57%) still had airway compromise on arrival of the enhanced care team; no oxygen had been administered to 52 patients (11%). There were 45 attempted intubations by ground paramedics with a 64% success rate and 11% unrecognized oesophageal intubation rate. Doctor-paramedic teams delivering prehospital anaesthesia achieved definitive airway management for all patients. Conclusions: A significant proportion of severely injured trauma patients required advanced airway interventions to effectively treat airway compromise. Standard ambulance service interventions were only effective for a proportion of patients, but might not have always been applied appropriately. Complications of advanced airway management occurred in both provider groups, but failed intubation and unrecognized oesophageal intubation were a particular problem in the paramedic intubation group.",0,0

23168902,"Tools of the Trade: A Novel Bronchoscope With a Built-in Miniature Video Screen, Camera, and Light Source","Objective: To evaluate the performance of a mobile bronchoscope with miniature video screen, light source, and a digital camera. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Inpatient and outpatient tertiary care center. Interventions: None. Patients: Twenty patients who were undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy from May 2009 to July 2009. Measurements and main results: Thirteen patients underwent bronchoscopy via the oral and nasal approach, 2 via a tracheostomy, and 5 via an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway. The scope was also used in the placement of a percutaneous tracheostomy tube and in the operating room for 3 procedural endotracheal intubations. The overall performance of mobile bronchoscope was satisfactory. The majority of difficulties encountered by the bronchoscopists came from the performance of the monitor. The main issue was the need to turn the screen to view the image in an upright position. Conclusions: The Airway Mobile Scope is well suited for airway examination and interventions often needed in emergency rooms, intensive care units, operating rooms, and office settings. The ease of use of the bronchoscope could be enhanced with small changes to the display of the image on the LCD screen.",0,0
26186767,Facial Image Analysis for Fully Automatic Prediction of Difficult Endotracheal Intubation,"Goal: Difficult tracheal intubation is a major cause of anesthesia-related injuries with potential life threatening complications. Detection and anticipation of difficult airway in the preoperative period is, thus, crucial for the patients' safety. We propose an automatic face-analysis approach to detect morphological traits related to difficult intubation and improve its prediction. Methods: For this purpose, we have collected a database of 970 patients including photos, videos, and ground truth data. Specific statistical face models have been learned using the faces in our database providing an automated parametrization of the facial morphology. The most discriminative morphological features are selected through the importance ranking provided by the random forest algorithm. The random forest approach has also been used to train a classifier on these selected features. We compare a threshold tuning method based on class prior with two methods, which learn an optimal threshold on a training set for tackling the inherent imbalanced nature of the database. Results: Our fully automated method achieves an AUC of 81.0% in a simplified experimental setup, where only easy and difficult patients are considered. A further validation on the entire database has proven that our method is applicable for real-world difficult intubation prediction, with AUC = 77.9%. Conclusion: The system performance is in line with the state-of-the-art medical diagnosis, based on ratings provided by trained anesthesiologists, whose assessment is guided by an extensive set of criteria. Significance: We present the first completely automatic and noninvasive difficult intubation detection system that is suitable for use in clinical settings.",0,0
10932687,Comparison between two different propofol dosage regimens for insertion of cuffed oro-pharyngeal airway,"Conditions for insertion of the cuffed oropharyngeal airway (COPA) were assessed following two different dosage regimens of propofol: group I (n = 40): 1.5 mg.kg-1; group II (n = 40): 2.5 mg.kg-1. The insertion conditions were evaluated by using a scoring system (-, + and +2) of gag and cough reflexes. The necessary use of additional dosage of propofol and the duration of post-induction apnea were also recorded. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of coughing, gagging and the additional usage of induction agent. The mean (+/- SD) duration of apnea was significantly longer in the high dose group: 9 +/- 6 min vs 5 +/- 7 min (p = 0.007). Low dose of propofol combines efficient insertion conditions with decreased length of post-induction apnea.",0,0
9229740,[Relationship between laryngoscopy degree and intubation difficulty],"Objectives: To determine the relation between difficult intubation and grade of direct laryngoscopy, as well as the factors that influence them, and prognosis. Patients and method: In 1,336 patients receiving general anesthesia, seven airway measurements were made to reflect degree of difficulty and predictive value of presurgical tests on direct laryngoscopy and intubation. Results: The incidences of difficult laryngoscopic and intubation procedures were 1.4 and 3.0%, respectively. Difficult intubation was more frequent in women and in patients between 40 and 65 years of age (p < 0.05). In 105 intubations (64.8%) performed with moderate difficulty (use of a stylette, external laryngeal pressure or two tries) and 17 (41.5%) performed with difficulty (three or more tries), the laryngoscopic procedure was graded as easy (Cormack-Lehane grade I-II). In these cases (easy laryngoscopy with moderate/difficult intubation), the causes recorded were size of endotracheal tube in comparison with the laryngeal opening (n = 11); anterior glotis (n = 36); insufficient relaxation (n = 31); disease in or beyond the vocal cords (n = 29); or undetermined (n = 15). In the easy intubation cases, the laryngoscopic procedures were grade III in 2.9%. Intubation was difficult in 16.3% (n = 39) of patients presenting some type of abnormality upon examination of the airway (p < 0.05). The airway characteristic that best predicted laryngoscopic difficulty was extension of the lower neck to 90 degrees (relative risk of 4.46), mouth opening less than 3.5 cm (3.92), presence of two airway abnormalities (4.25) and presence of three or more abnormalities (5.39) (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The fact that cases of easy laryngoscopy coincide with difficult intubation suggests that, to the degree of intubation difficulty must be added extrinsic factors (individual skill, maneuvers performed, instrumentation, relaxation of the laryngeal musculature and others) that are hard to standardize and reflect when predicting an intubation by the grade of difficulty in laryngoscopy.",0,0
17056964,Craniocervical extension improves the specificity and predictive value of the Mallampati airway evaluation,"Background: The modified Mallampati (MMP) classification is a standard airway examination that assesses mouth opening and structures within the oral cavity. Recent data suggest that maximal mouth opening (as measured by interdental distance) is possible only with extension of the craniocervical junction. Because the MMP examination is performed with the head in a neutral position, the airway may appear worse because of submaximal interdental distance. We hypothesized that adding craniocervical extension to the MMP would allow for greater mouth opening, lower scores, and less false positives than the traditional MMP examination. Methods: Multiple clinicians with at least 1 yr of airway experience evaluated adult airways (n = 60) with the MMP examination (with head in neutral position). The same examination was then repeated with the addition of craniocervical extension (Extended Mallampati Score, EMS). Results: On average, craniocervical extension decreased the MMP class (P < 0.002). The EMS improved specificity from 70% to 80% and positive predictive value from 24% to 31% when compared with the traditional MMP. The sensitivity (83%) was the same for MMP and EMS. Conclusions: Craniocervical extension improves the specificity and positive predictive value of the MMP airway evaluation while retaining sensitivity of the traditional MMP examination. The introduction of the EMS into clinical practice should be considered.",0,0

24247414,Collaborative intervention to improve airway assessment and safety in management for anaesthesia: the Qualitat & Via Aèria (QUAVA) study,"Background: Airway assessment and management are cornerstones of anaesthesia, yet airway complications remain an important source of morbidity. Objective: We performed a before-and-after evaluation of a collaborative intervention to improve adherence to airway assessment and management guidelines in patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia. Design: A prospective, multicentre before-and-after evaluation of a collaborative intervention. Setting: Collaborative intervention to improve adherence to airway assessment and management guidelines in patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia. Data were collected on 21 consecutive days before and after the intervention. Participants: Anaesthetists with staff or residency positions at 22 hospitals. Patients aged 18 years or older undergoing nonemergency surgery were recruited. Intervention: Establishing a learning network that included local leaders, meetings to share experiences and knowledge, interactive sessions and provision of printed materials on airway assessment and management. Clinical airway management for general anaesthesia was provided by the anaesthetists participating in the study. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were the completion of airway assessment at the preanaesthetic visit, rates of unanticipated difficult airway, algorithm adherence and related airway complications. Results: The study included 3753 patients (1947 preintervention and 1806 postintervention). The percentage of patients with a complete airway assessment increased from 25.1% preintervention to 48.4% postintervention (P <0.001). The incidences of unanticipated difficult airway were 4.1% before the intervention and 3% after it (P = 0.433). Rates of adherence to the algorithms for anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway management were similar in the two periods. The incidences of related adverse events were also similar. Conclusion: The collaborative intervention was effective in improving airway assessment but not in changing difficult airway management practices.",0,0
20191771,Airway assessment based on a three column model of direct laryngoscopy,"Airway assessment has remained a problematic area, largely due to the low sensitivities, specificities and/or positive predictive values of most bedside tests. In this paper a structured overview of the common preoperative airway assessment tests is presented, based on a model for direct laryngoscopy that has been previously described. This model is composed of three columns: anterior middle and posterior The anterior column tests are classified into the assessment of volume and compliance of the submandibular space, the range of movement of the temporomandibular joints and the flexibility of the stylohyoid ligament. Reductions in volume of the anterior column may be absolute or relative. An absolute reduction may occur with shortening of either the incisor-hyoid distance, the temporomandibular joint-incisor distance or the temporomandibular joint-temporomandibular joint distance. A relative reduction may be seen with either prominent upper front incisors or large tongues. Testing of the middle column includes a history and physical examination of the upper respiratory system, imaging of the airway (such as X-ray, computed tomography scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans) and nasopharyngoscopy. The posterior column may be assessed by the range of movement of the neck, especially the range of extension of the occipito-atlanto-axial complex. By integrating common tests of the anterior middle and posterior columns within this three-column model, the practitioner may be better positioned to understand the complexity of direct laryngoscopy in both normal and difficult airway scenarios.",0,0
16116830,Oncological outcome after CO2 laser cordectomy for early-stage glottic carcinoma,"This study aims to define indications for micro-endoscopic laser surgery in early glottic carcinoma (Tis, T1a and T1b), to examine patterns of local recurrences and related retreatment methods. A cohort of 79 patients with previously untreated early glottic carcinoma, subjected to endoscopic CO2 laser excision between January 1993 and October 2000, was retrospectively examined. Patients included in data analysis had a mean follow-up of 39 months. Depth and extension of excisions were graded according to European Laryngological Society Classification, and included 5 types of cordectomy. Actuarial overall survival, determinate survival, disease-free survival, ultimate local control, and laryngeal preservation rates, at 3 years, were 97.5%, 98.7%, 89.9%, 92.4%, and 97.4%, respectively. Survival curves for overall and disease-free survival were calculated from the date of diagnosis using the KaplanMeier method. Of the 8 patients with local recurrences, 5 were managed with larynx-sparing treatment: a second endoscopic CO, laser cordectomy was performed in 2 patients, a supracricoid laryngectomy in 2 patients, and one patient was treated with radiotherapy. The remaining 3 patients were submitted to total laryngectomy, one of whom died due to neck metastases. One patient died from other causes. All other patients were alive and disease-free at the last follow-up. Understanding the diffusion pathways and timing of laryngeal glottic cancer is important both for treatment and prognosis. Correct knowledge of the subsites of the larynx and the routine use of pre-operative and intra-operative diagnostic assessment is useful in the selection of the appropriate type of resection. Microendoscopic laser surgery is efficacious for early glottic carcinoma, with oncological results comparable to those observed following radiotherapy or conventional partial laryngectomy, however, in this case, local recurrences have a greater range of re-treatment options.",0,0
27190925,Innovative Application of a Microlaryngeal Surgery Tube for difficult Airway Management in a Case of Down's Syndrome,"An 11-year-old male child, known case of down's syndrome with congenital oesophageal stricture was posted for oesophageal dilatation. Preoperative airway assessment revealed a high arched palate, receding mandible and Mallampati Score of 2. During surgery, after loss of consciousness which was described as loss of eyelash reflex and adequate jaw relaxation, direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation was attempted with a cuffed endotracheal tube number 5.0mm ID (internal diameter). The endotracheal tube could not be negotiated smoothly, so 5.0mm ID uncuffed endotracheal tube was used which passed through easily, but on auscultation revealed a significant leak. Later, intubation via a Micro Laryngeal Surgery (MLS) cuffed tube 4.0mm ID was attempted. The MLS tube advanced smoothly and there was no associated leak on positive pressure ventilation. Thus by innovative thinking and avant-garde reasoning, a definitive airway device could be positioned with no other suitable alternative at hand.",0,0

1416135,Tracheal intubation without the use of muscle relaxants: a technique using propofol and varying doses of alfentanil,"We have noted that tracheal intubation can be accomplished in many patients after induction of anesthesia with propofol and alfentanil without the simultaneous use of muscle relaxants. This study was designed to evaluate airway and intubating conditions after administration of propofol and alfentanil in 75 ASA physical status I or II outpatients with Mallampati class I airways undergoing various surgical procedures. The patients were randomly assigned to one of five groups for induction of anesthesia. All patients received midazolam 1 mg IV before induction of anesthesia. Group I patients (n = 15) received d-tubocurarine 3 mg, thiamylal 4 mg/kg, and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV. Groups II-V patients (n = 15 each) received alfentanil 30, 40, 50, or 60 micrograms/kg followed by propofol 2 mg/kg IV. No muscle relaxants were given to patients in groups II-V. Airway management was performed by one of the authors who was blinded as to the dose of alfentanil administered. After loss of consciousness, patients' lungs were ventilated via face mask, and the ease of ventilation was recorded. Jaw mobility was also assessed. Ninety seconds after administration of the propofol or thiamylal, laryngoscopy was performed and exposure of the glottis and position of the vocal cords were noted. Intubation of the trachea was performed and patient response was noted. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were also recorded before induction of anesthesia, after induction, and then again after intubation of the trachea. The lungs of all patients were easily ventilated via mask, and the jaw was judged to be relaxed in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0
25712988,Tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce mesenchymal stem cell-mediated resistance in BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used as a frontline therapy for BCR-ABL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, resistance to TKI therapy arises rapidly, and its underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel cascade of events initiated by TKIs and traversing through mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to leukemic cells, leading to resistance. MSCs exposed to TKIs acquired a new functional status with the expression of genes encoding for chemo-attractants, adhesion molecules, and prosurvival growth factors, and this priming enabled leukemic cells to form clusters underneath the MSCs. This cluster formation was associated with the protection of ALL cells from therapy as leukemic cells switched from BCR-ABL signaling to IL-7R/Janus kinase signaling to survive in the MSC milieu. Our findings illustrate a novel perspective in the evolution of TKI resistance and provide insights for advancing the treatment of BCR-ABL(+) ALL.",0,0
18187998,Tonsillar lipoma causing difficult intubation: a case report,"A 63-year-old woman with confusion and disorientation was referred to the Pulmonary Medicine Department of Afyon Kocatepe University. She was uncooperative and her peripheral oxygen saturation was 75%. She was on diuretic therapy for heart failure. An emergency intubation was planned due to the development of respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia, but the patient could not be intubated. After several attempts, intubation was successful only by digital manipulation of a lateral pharyngeal mass noticed incidentally. She was inadvertently extubated on the third day of intubation and an emergency tracheotomy was performed. Otolaryngological examination revealed a mass originating from the right palatine tonsil, and a computed tomography scan showed a hypodense mass extending from the uvula to the epiglottis. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent a right tonsillectomy and a lipomatous mass (3.6x3.2x2.2 cm) and the palatine tonsil (3.5x1.1x0.8 cm) were resected. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of mature adipocytes with thin fibrous septae.

19396507,Effect of manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine in adults on the rate of difficult orotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy: a randomized controlled trial,"Purpose: Although manual in-line stabilization (MILS) is commonly used during endotracheal intubation in patients with either known or suspected cervical spine instability, the effect of MILS on orotracheal intubation is poorly documented. This study evaluated the rate of failed tracheal intubation in a fixed time interval with MILS. Methods: Two hundred elective surgical patients were randomized into two groups. In the MILS group, the patient's head was stabilized in a neutral position by grasping the patient's mastoid processes to minimize any head movement during tracheal intubation. In the control group, the patient's head rested in an optimal position for tracheal intubation. A 30-sec period was allowed to complete tracheal intubation with a #3 Macintosh laryngoscope blade. The primary endpoint was the rate of failed tracheal intubation at 30 sec. Secondary endpoints included tracheal intubation time and the Cormack & Lehane grade of laryngoscopy. Results: Patient characteristics were similar with respect to demographic data and risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation. The rate of failed tracheal intubation at 30 sec was 50% (47/94) in the MILS group compared to 5.7% (6/105) in the control group (P < 0.0001). Laryngoscopic grades 3 and 4 were more frequently observed in the MILS group. Mean times for successful tracheal intubation were 15.8 +/- 8.5 sec and 8.7 +/- 4.6 sec for the MILS and control groups, respectively (mean difference 7.1, CI(95%) 5.0-9.3, P < 0.0001). All patients who failed tracheal intubation in the MILS group were successfully intubated when MILS was removed. Conclusion: In patients with otherwise normal airways, MILS increases the tracheal intubation failure rate at 30 sec and worsens laryngeal visualization during direct laryngoscopy.",0,0
24105784,Airway algorithm for the management of patients with a King LT,"Objectives/hypothesis: To discuss an algorithm for managing the airway in patients presenting with a King LT in place. Study design: Case series at a single institution with planned chart review. Methods: This study reviewed the management of three patients who presented to a tertiary academic medical facility emergency department following placement of a King LT at an outside hospital or in the field. Clinical history at admission as well as each patient's hospital course was evaluated. We discuss the management of the airway in each of these cases and use these to help design an algorithm for improving outcomes in patients with a King LT in place. Results: In each of the three cases presented, the Otolaryngology Department was consulted for definitive airway management. In two of these patients, the airway was successfully secured using endotracheal intubation. Only one patient required tracheostomy. We discuss an algorithm for managing these patients to obtain a safe airway, which includes assessing the airway with flexible endoscopy and then proceeding with intubation by the Seldinger technique or intubation using a video laryngoscope. In some cases, tracheostomy will be required to definitively secure the airway. Conclusions: The King LT is a valuable tool available in the field to help to temporarily secure the airway. Otolaryngologists should have an appropriate airway algorithm for managing patients with a King LT in place to minimize the need for a tracheostomy.",0,0
24842175,"Is video laryngoscope-assisted flexible tracheoscope intubation feasible for patients with predicted difficult airway? A prospective, randomized clinical trial","Background: Failed intubation may result in both increased morbidity and mortality. The combination of a video laryngoscope and a flexible tracheoscope used as a flexible video stylet may improve the success rate of securing a difficult airway. We tested the hypothesis that this combination is a feasible way to facilitate intubation in patients with a predicted difficult airway in that it will shorten intubation times and reduce the number of intubation attempts. Methods: We conducted a randomized, prospective trial in 140 patients with anticipated difficult airways undergoing elective or urgent surgery. After insertion of video laryngoscope, patients were randomly assigned to either having their tube placed with the use of a preformed stylet (control group) or with a flexible tracheoscope (intervention group). The primary outcome measures were time to successful intubation and number of intubation attempts. Results: The number of intubations requiring 2 or more intubation attempts was similar in the 2 groups (14% control vs 13% intervention, P = 1.0); the number of patients requiring 3 or more intubation attempts was not significantly different (8.6% control vs 1.4% intervention, P = 0.12). Distribution for time to intubation also did not differ between the control (median of 66 seconds, interquartile range 47-89) and the intervention group (median of 71 seconds, interquartile range 52-100; P = 0.35). In the control group, 4 patients, all with cervical spine pathology, had the trachea intubated successfully with the video laryngoscope plus flexible tracheoscope after 3 failed attempts with video laryngoscope and rigid stylet. For these 4 patients, time from the decision to change the intubation method to successful intubation with a flexible tracheoscope was 36 ± 14 seconds. Overall success probability for cervical spine patients was 100% (20/20) in the intervention group and 80% (16/20) in the control group, with an exact 95% confidence interval for the difference of 1.4% to 44%, P = 0.04. Conclusions: Flexible tracheoscope-assisted video laryngoscopic intubation is a feasible alternative to video laryngoscope only intubation in patients with predicted difficult airways. A flexible tracheoscope used in combination with video laryngoscope may also further increase the success rate of intubation in select patients with a proven difficult airway, particularly when in-line stabilization is required.",0,0
9389866,Unsuspected difficult intubation caused by a laryngeal web,"We report a case of unsuspected difficult intubation in an adult caused by laryngeal web formation in the anterior commissure of the larynx. After induction of anaesthesia, most parts of the posterior commissure of the vocal cords were seen clearly at laryngoscopy, but a 7.5-mm internal diameter (id) tracheal tube could not be advanced below the level of the vocal cords because of resistance. Intubation was re-attempted several times after oxygenation by mask with trials of smaller tubes. Finally, a 5.0-mm id cuffed tube was passed successfully through the vocal cords, and secured in place. Because of the unexpected difficulties in intubation, an otolaryngologist was consulted to examine the larynx with a microscope. A web of 0.5 cm in the anterior commissures was found which caused subglottic stenosis.",0,0
26460721,Nasotracheal intubation in patients with limited mouth opening: a comparison between fibreoptic intubation and the Trachway®,"In patients with limited mouth opening, traditional laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopes are not useful when performing nasotracheal intubation. Eighty patients with limited mouth opening who required nasotracheal intubation were randomly assigned to either fibreoptic intubation (n = 40) or the Trachway(®) (n = 40). Using the modified nasal intubation difficulty scale, 22 (55%) patients who received fibreoptic intubation were categorised as no difficulty compared with 40 (100%) patients in the Trachway group (p < 0.001). Mean (SD) total intubation time was 71.8 (23.3) s in patients who received fibreoptic intubation compared with 35.4 (9.8) s in the Trachway group (p < 0.001).

19496760,Combining the EndoFlex tube with fiberoptic bronchoscopy in difficult intubation,"We applied a combination technique using the EndoFlex tube with fiberoptic bronchoscopy for a 69-year-old man presenting with limited mouth opening and neck movement. Awake nasotracheal intubation was performed under conscious sedation with propofol and fentanyl. After positioning the tip of the EndoFlex tube in the oropharynx, the fiberoptic bronchoscope was inserted into the tube until the tip reached the bevel of the tube. Anterior flexion of the distal tip of the EndoFlex tube facilitated uncomplicated insertion of the tube into the trachea without impingement on the arytenoids. Fiberoptic visualization confirmed that the distal-tip flexing mechanism of the EndoFlex tube corrected the direction of the tube tip anteriorly, allowing entry into the trachea. We present a case where this technique proved valuable for tracheal intubation in a patient with limitations of mouth opening and neck movement.",0,0
26670262,Radical evolution: the 2015 Difficult Airway Society guidelines for managing unanticipated difficult or failed tracheal intubation,"There is little doubt that these guidelines incorporate advances made in airway management since 2004. They will change day-to-day practice of anaesthesia, as outlined above, from pre-operative airway assessment, to integrating the WHO team briefing, to the use and provision of equipment and drugs, and the recording of information on the anaesthesia chart. They will inform the later analysis of any critical airway incidents, especially as documentation and postoperative management are addressed, and they will encourage training in a range of techniques. Taken together, not quite a revolution but certainly a very 'radical evolution'.Assessment of the utility of the new guidelines should consider if they can be used as tools to enhance knowledge and training, or in addition as a prosthesis to bridge the gap between the requirements of and our abilities during emergencies. Formal testing may reveal which aspects of their design, complex as it is, may distract from, rather than enhance, airway management during crises.All guidelines represent a standard of care or a normative approach to a clinical problem. As such, they not only help guide clinicians, but they also provide the broader community with the opportunity to improve standards, to ensure equipment is available, and that training for the skills and processes required are in place to ensure successful adoption.",0,0
22475762,Predictors of a difficult intubation in the bariatric patient: does preoperative body mass index matter?,"Background: The incidence of difficult intubations in morbidly obese patients has been reported to be 12-20%; however, no well-established predictors of a difficult intubation exist for this patient population. Our objective was to evaluate the factors associated with a difficult intubation in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at an integrated multispecialty health system with a 325-bed community teaching hospital serving 19 counties. Methods: The anesthetic records of patients undergoing LRYGB from 2001 to 2010 were reviewed. Difficult intubations were defined as direct laryngoscopy graded ≥1 on a 0-2 difficulty scale and unplanned fiberoptic intubations. Statistical analysis included chi-square, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 915 consecutive patients underwent LRYGB during the study period. Of these, 3 patients were excluded because of incomplete data. Of the 912 included patients, 25 (2.7%) underwent planned fiberoptic intubation, 830 (91%) had an uneventful intubation, and 57 (6.3%) had a difficult intubation. Difficult intubations were more common in men than in women (11% versus 6%, P = .027). Difficult intubations were not associated with an increasing preoperative body mass index (P = .073), the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (P = .784), or the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (P = .335). Multivariate predictors of a difficult intubation were Mallampati class 4 (odds ratio [OR] 2.76, P = .035), abnormal thyromental distance (OR 4.39, P = .001), restricted jaw mobility (OR 3.26, P = .018), and a history of a difficult intubation (OR 4.17, P = .002). Conclusions: An increased Mallampati class, abnormal thyromental distance, restricted jaw mobility, and a history of difficult intubations were independent predictors of a difficult intubation. An increasing body mass index did not predict for a difficult intubation.",0,0
23251996,Infection control practices of laryngoscope blades: a review of the literature,"Current procedures for cleaning anesthesia airway equipment as assessed by the presence of visible and occult blood on laryngoscope blades and handles as labeled ""ready for patient use"" has been reported to be ineffective. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are 2 commonly seen pathogens that frequently are found in the healthcare setting. It has been shown that HBV can survive on a dry surface for at least 7 days and both HIV and HBV are transmitted via blood. The potential for cross-contamination from airway equipment to patient has been shown in several studies. To prevent further potential infections, it should be ascertained why anesthesia providers are not all using disposable laryngoscope blades. The purpose of this literature review is to determine the use and infection control practices of disposable laryngoscope blades. Their frequency of use, their evaluation of ease of use, and any complications encountered when using the disposable blade are reviewed, as well as the perceptions of anesthesia providers regarding disposable laryngoscope blades.",0,0

18378968,Brief report: tracheal intubation using the Bonfils intubation fibrescope or direct laryngoscopy for patients with a simulated difficult airway,"Background: The Bonfils intubation fibrescope (BIF), a rigid, straight and reusable fibreoptic device, is being used increasingly to facilitate endotracheal intubation after direct laryngoscopy has failed. We tested the hypothesis that, with the BIF compared to direct laryngoscopy, the rate of failed endotracheal intubation could be reduced in patients with a difficult airway, simulated by means of a rigid cervical immobilization collar. Methods: Seventy-six adults undergoing elective gynecological surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to have endotracheal intubation, facilitated with either a standard size 3 Macintosh laryngoscope blade, or the BIF. A rigid cervical immobilization collar was used to simulate a difficult airway, by reducing mouth opening and limiting neck extension. If endotracheal intubation could not be achieved within two attempts, the cervical collar was removed, and direct laryngoscopy was performed thereafter, using a Macintosh blade in all subjects. The success rate of endotracheal tube placement was the primary outcome variable. Results: Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. After neck immobilization, the inter-incisor distance was reduced to 2.6 +/- 0.7 cm (Macintosh) and 2.6 +/- 0.8 cm (BIF). Tube placement was successful in 15/38 (39.5%) patients with a Macintosh blade, and in 31/38 patients with the BIF (81.6%; P = 0.0003). Time required for tube placement was 53 +/- 22 sec (Macintosh) and 64 +/- 24 sec (BIF; P = 0.15). Conclusion: The Bonfils intubation fibrescope is a more effective intubating device for patients with immobilized cervical spine and significantly limited inter-incisor distance, when compared to direct laryngoscopy.",0,0
15117468,Determination of the changes in the hypoglossal nerve function after suspension laryngoscopy with needle electromyography of the tongue,"The purpose of this study was to determine changes in the hypoglossal nerve function after suspension laryngoscopy with needle electromyography of the tongue. This study also attempted to determine the possible relationship between the predictive factors of intubation difficulty by using the intubation difficulty scale, which was introduced by Adnet et al., duration of suspension laryngoscopy and changes in hypoglossal nerve function after suspension laryngoscopy. The study was performed on 39 patients who underwent suspension laryngoscopy for benign glottic pathology. Pre-operative airway assessment was evaluated by the intubation difficulty scale and the duration of suspension laryngoscopy was recorded. Needle electromyography of the tongue was performed three or four weeks after the suspension laryngoscopy. After needle electromyography of the tongue, increased polyphasia was found in 13 patients (33 per cent), bilaterally in three of them. The interference pattern was reduced in two of these 13 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in predictive factors of intubation difficulty and the duration of the operation between these 13 patients with increased polyphasia and the remaining 26 patients with completely normal electromyography findings. These findings show that, in spite of normal clinical tongue function, subclinical changes can be detected by needle electromyography of the tongue after suspension laryngoscopy.",0,0
23330426,Airway management disasters--lessons from the United Kingdom,"The Fourth National Audit Project (NAP4) was set up by the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society to provide an insight into major complications of airway management in the United Kingdom. The NAP4 found that one serious airway complication such as death, brain damage, the need for surgical airway or unexpected intensive care admission, was reported for every 5500 general anaesthetics. Most of the events happened during daytime to a senior experienced clinicians. Airway assessment was not recorded before surgery in 74% of patients that ended up with life threatening airway complications. Aspiration was responsible for 26% of life threatening airway complications and for 50% of all deaths. The NAP4 found that airway problems were twice as common in obese patients (BMI 30-35) and four times as common in morbidly obese (BMI >35). Awake fibreoptic intubation was indicated and not performed in a significant number of reported incidents. Thirty percent of serious airway complications were associated with extubation or removal of laryngeal mask airway at the end of anaesthesia. The findings of the NAP4 have the potential to significantly influence airway management practice of all anaesthetists irrespective of where in the world they practice anaesthesia.",0,0
8342749,[A difficult intubation: prolapse of the epiglottis into the trachea in an infant],"Luxation of the epiglottic cartilage is a very uncommon complication of endotracheal intubation in paediatric anaesthesia. We report on a case of prolapse of the epiglottic cartilage into the trachea in a 4-month-old child who had been anaesthetized for palliative banding of the pulmonary artery and correction of a coarctation of the aorta. Further malformations included a single ventricle combined with an ASD II and VSD. The first intubation (ID 3.5 mm) via the nasopharyngeal route seemed not to involve any problems; breathing pressure, however, increased to 25 cm H2O. Direct laryngoscopy after extubation of the smaller tube and insertion of another one (ID 4.0 mm) demonstrated a completely blocked trachea. The epiglottidean cartilage had prolapsed into the tracheal lumen and excluded any possibility of ventilating the patient. After seizing the epiglottic cartilage with a Magill forceps it was possible to pull the cartilage out of the trachea and to intubate again with the 4.0 mm tube. There were no complications in the postoperative period.",0,0

In this study, the impact of this typical anesthesia co-morbidity on revenues of an university hospital was investigated. Methods: The computerized records of 21,204 anesthesia procedures from the year 2005 were scanned for failed or difficult intubations. The results were checked for accordance with the coding recommendation of the Medical Service of the Health Insurance Funds (MDK) with respect to the co-morbidity T88.4. For all valid cases, the DRG, the diagnosis code and the co-morbidity codes were retrieved from the hospital information system. Subsequently all cases were regrouped with the GetDRG grouper (Fa. GEOS), taking the co-morbidity T88.4 in account. Results: Out of the 21,204 patients, 12,261 were intubated for general anesthesia. A failed or difficult intubation according to the definition of the expert group of social medicine was documented in 276 anesthesia cases (2.3%). In 31 cases the coding of the co-morbidity T88.4 led to an increase in revenue by grouping the case in a different DRG. Using the base rate of the year 2005 (EUR 3,379.66), the surplus in basic points of 17.093 resulted in an additional reimbursement of EUR 57,768.53. Conclusion: With this study it was shown that the consequent coding of the co-morbidity T88.4 during anesthesia can lead to increased reimbursement. A prerequisite is the accurate documentation and coding by the attending anesthetist.",0,0
19950730,Upper lip bite test as a predictor of difficult mask ventilation: a prospective study,"Background: Oxygenation and ventilation by means of bag-mask and ambubag play a significant role in maintaining an optimal oxygen saturation of blood and hence the essence of life itself. Predicting difficulty in mask ventilation is again of paramount importance at the time of induction of anesthesia, and in emergency situations. In this study we aimed at evaluating factors that could help in predicting the difficulty of bag-mask ventilation. Methods: In a prospective study, 200 patients were allocated into two groups, 100 each. First group with a ULBT class I, and the other group with ULBT class II and III. Factors such as height, weight, gender, past history of snoring, neck circumference, Mallampati class, sternomental and thyromental distances were then evaluated in each of the patients in the two groups in order to arrive at their impact on the incidence of difficult mask ventilation. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, student t-test and Fisher's exact tests depending upon the situation. A p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The results revealed that negative predictive value (NPV) of ULBT class, history of snoring and neck circumference were 86%, 83%, 81%, respectively. A combination of these three predictors had an NPV of 95%. Conclusion: ULBT class alone was of value in predicting difficulty in mask ventilation, but a combination of the three tests significantly improved the predictive value.",1,1
23666770,Anatomical reconstructions of pediatric airways from endoscopic images: a pilot study of the accuracy of quantitative endoscopy,"Objectives/hypothesis: To evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) airway reconstructions obtained using quantitative endoscopy (QE). We developed this novel technique to reconstruct precise 3D representations of airway geometries from endoscopic video streams. This method, based on machine vision methodologies, uses a post-processing step of the standard videos obtained during routine laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. We hypothesize that this method is precise and will generate assessment of airway size and shape similar to those obtained using computed tomography (CT). Study design: This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB). We analyzed video sequences from pediatric patients receiving rigid bronchoscopy. Methods: We generated 3D scaled airway models of the subglottis, trachea, and carina using QE. These models were compared to 3D airway models generated from CT. We used the CT data as the gold standard measure of airway size, and used a mixed linear model to estimate the average error in cross-sectional area and effective diameter for QE. Results: The average error in cross sectional area (area sliced perpendicular to the long axis of the airway) was 7.7 mm(2) (variance 33.447 mm(4)). The average error in effective diameter was 0.38775 mm (variance 2.45 mm(2)), approximately 9% error. Conclusion: Our pilot study suggests that QE can be used to generate precise 3D reconstructions of airways. This technique is atraumatic, does not require ionizing radiation, and integrates easily into standard airway assessment protocols. We conjecture that this technology will be useful for staging airway disease and assessing surgical outcomes.",0,0

1489077,[Fiberoptic determination of the position of the laryngeal mask],"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) provides a patent airway when placed 'blindly' into the hypopharynx. At the laryngeal side it is supposed to form a seal surrounding the laryngeal inlet with the epiglottis lying outside the mask aperture. This study is designed to assess the prelaryngeal position of the mask by the fibreoptic technique. METHODS. After approval by the local ethical committee and informed consent, 100 adult patients (ASA groups I and II) undergoing general anaesthesia for extracorporal stroke wave lithotripsy (ESWL, Lithotripter HM 3, Dornier) of the kidney were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5-2.5 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (1-1.5 micrograms.kg-1) and maintained with isoflurane and N2O (65% in O2) as clinically indicated. The LMA was left in situ until the patients opened their mouth on command. Monitoring consisted of an ECG (SMV 104-D, Dornier), a pulse oximeter (Nellcor 200, Draeger), and a non-invasive blood pressure monitor (BP 103 N, Hoyer). Clinical assessment of airway patency and fibreoptic laryngoscopy (BF Typ 10, Olympus)--immediately and 20 min following the insertion of the LMA--were performed by two observers. RESULTS. The insertion of the LMA was successful on the first attempt in 89 patients while 5% required two, 4% three and 2% four attempts. 'Blindly' inserted without neuromuscular blockade the LMA provided a clinically sufficient airway in all patients. A central position of the LMA was assessed in only 59% of the cases. In 4 patients the mask was riding on the vocal folds. Positioned at the posterior larynx the cuff produced a compression of the laryngeal orifice when insufflated. Oblique insertion of the LMA or oblique head position during insertion produced a misplacement of the LMA. In 5 cases the LMA followed lateral movements of the head without losing its central position. In 87% the epiglottis was within the lumen of the LMA. Secretions inside the mask lumen or at the anatomic structures were seen in 36%. During manual ventilation with high inspiratory pressure (> 25 cm H2O) the oesophagus opened in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS. Previous studies have suggested that the LMA takes a 'perfect' position at the laryngeal side when a clinically patent airway is recognized. In contrast, our results demonstrated that a central position of the LMA is achieved in only 59% of the cases. Our results indicate that epiglottic downfolding or left/right side or anterior/posterior misplacement are common but generally provide a satisfactory patent airway. This is consistent with fibreoptic findings in children and radiological observations in adults. The LMA is an essential enrichment to conventional airway management. It provides a better seal than the face mask, especially in bearded or in old patients where the facial contours are often not suited to the mask. Ideal indications seem to be elective operations of intermediate duration (1-2 h). The LMA does not protect against aspiration. For patients who are at risk of regurgitation of gastric contents, use of the LMA is absolutely contraindicated. Relative contraindications are local pathology of the pharynx and situations with low pulmonary compliance and/or high airway resistance (massive obesity, asthma, etc.), especially during controlled ventilation. Further studies are necessary to establish definite indications for the application of the LMA.",0,0
21572078,No evidence for diagnostic value of Mallampati score in patients suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Objective: To analyze whether the Mallampati score is reliable as a simple diagnostic test for predicting obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Data sources: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases. Review methods: Studies were ranked by their relevance and validity in a critical appraisal table. Positive and negative predictive values were obtained or recalculated from the selected articles. Results: Eight relevant articles met the inclusion criteria. Three studies reported predictive values for a Mallampati score of 3 to 4. The prevalence (or prior probability) of OSAS in these 3 studies was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50-67), 76% (95% CI, 72-79), and 82% (95% CI, 80-84), respectively. With a Mallampati score of 1 to 2, the risk of OSAS decreases to 45% (95% CI, 33-58), 74% (95% CI, 70-78), and 81% (95% CI, 77-86), respectively. With a Mallampati score of 3 to 4, the risk of OSAS is 69% (95% CI, 59-80), 82% (95% CI, 74-89), and 82% (95% CI, 79-85), respectively. The differences between the prior and the posterior probabilities are rather small and do not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: There is no evidence to maintain that the Mallampati score is of added value for ruling in or ruling out a diagnosis of OSAS in patients suspected for OSAS.",0,0
7573863,Difficult direct laryngoscopy in patients with cervical spine disease,"Two hundred and fifty three patients were examined before surgery for cervical spine disease. The grade of glottic visibility was determined at direct laryngoscopy, using the classification proposed by Cormack and Lehane. The overall prevalence of difficulty (grades 3 and 4) was 20%. Patients with disease that includes the occipito-atlanto-axial complex have a higher prevalence of difficulty than those with disease below the axis vertebra. Occipito-atlanto-axial disease is associated with poor mandibular protrusion. The best single predictor of difficulty was reduced separation of the posterior elements of the first and second cervical vertebrae on lateral radiographs. The Mallampati examination was the best single predictor on physical examination. The Mallampati may be an indicator of poor cranio-cervical extension. Difficulty was rare in patients with class A mandibular protrusion, and invariable in patients with class C protrusion.",0,0
15168942,[Perioperative management of a patient with alcaptonuria--a case report],"Alcaptonuria is a very rare enzymatic disease with a compromised degradation of the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. As a consequence, homogentisic acid accumulates, most of which is cleared by the kidneys. In time, homogentisic acid forms black pigment, which accumulates throughout the body in connective tissue such as cartilage and joints. Apart from superficial discoloration, the most clinical manifestation of the disease is arthropathy, starting in middle age. From the anaesthesiologist's point of view, there is a severe risk of difficult airway because of an advanced stiffness of the cervical spine and a reduced mouth opening in these patients. Due to deformity and stiffness of the spine, difficulties in spinal and epidural anaesthesia must be reckoned with. A further risk for patients with alcaptonuria is cardiac involvement, which occurs later than degenerative changes of the joints. The accumulated pigment most likely adds to the development of degenerative changes of the valve and coronary artery disease and there is an increased risk of developing aneurysms in atherosclerotic altered vessels. Therefore, at the preoperative visit a thorough clinical cardiovascular examination should be performed. Cardiological advice and an examination should be sought from a specialist. For intubation, fibreoptic procedures should be considered. Anaesthetic management and perioperative monitoring are determined by the results of the cardiological examination and the type and extent of the operation.",0,0

This study evaluated the impact of a comprehensive effort to improve trauma care through multidisciplinary education and the use of simulation training to reinforce training and evaluate performance. Methods: For a 1-year period, expanded trauma education including monthly trauma simulation sessions using high-fidelity simulators was implemented. All members of the multidisciplinary trauma resuscitation team participated in education, including simulations. Each simulation session included 2 trauma scenarios that were videotaped for debriefing as well as subsequent analysis of team performance. Scored simulations were divided into early (initial 4 months) and late (final 4 months) for comparison. Results: For the first year of the program, 160 members of our multidisciplinary team participated in the simulation. In the early group, the mean percentage of appropriately completed tasks was 65%, whereas in the late group, this increased to 75% (P < .05). Improvements were also observed in initial assessment, airway management, management of pelvic fractures, and cervical spine care. Conclusions: Training of a multidisciplinary team in the care of pediatric trauma patients can be enhanced and evaluated through the use of high-fidelity simulation.

25582398,Clinical predictors of effective continuous positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome,"Objectives/hypothesis: To identify standard clinical parameters that may predict the optimal level of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Study design: This is a retrospective study in a tertiary academic medical center that included 129 adult patients (117 males and 12 females) with OSAHS confirmed by diagnostic polysomnography (PSG). Methods: All OSAHS patients underwent successful full-night manual titration to determine the optimal CPAP pressure level for OSAHS treatment. The PSG parameters and completed physical examination, including body mass index, tonsil size grading, modified Mallampati grade (also known as updated Friedman's tongue position [uFTP]), uvular length, neck circumference, waist circumference, hip circumference, thyroid-mental distance, and hyoid-mental distance (HMD) were recorded. Results: When the physical examination variables and OSAHS disease were correlated singly with the optimal CPAP pressure, we found that uFTP, HMD, and apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) were reliable predictors of CPAP pressures (P = .013, P = .002, and P < .001, respectively, by multiple regression). When all important factors were considered in a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, a significant correlation with optimal CPAP pressure was formulated by factoring the uFTP, HMD, and AHI (optimal CPAP pressure = 1.01 uFTP + 0.74 HMD + 0.059 AHI - 1.603). Conclusions: This study distinguished the correlation between uFTP, HMD, and AHI with the optimal CPAP pressure. The structure of the upper airway (especially tongue base obstruction) and disease severity may predict the effective level of CPAP pressure. Level of evidence: 4.",0,0
15071886,[Lockjaw caused by induction of anesthesia in a volunteer bone marrow donor],"A 43-year-old healthy female volunteer donor was scheduled for bone marrow harvesting. In the operating room her mouth opening was ascertained to be 5 cm. Anesthesia was induced with thiamylal 250 mg, fentanyl 0.1 mg and vecuronium 6 mg i.v. Her mouth opening was found reduced to 2 cm that was not improved by additional vecuronium 2 mg. A consulted oral surgeon diagnosed temporomandibular disorder. After she was awakened once with resumed mouth opening, anesthesia was reinduced with a bite block placed and with her jaw held open by the oral surgeon, which brought the same results. Laryngoscopy was performed with the jaw forcefully opened and with cricoid pressure applied and the trachea was intubated. The surgical procedure and anesthesia thereafter were uneventful. Postoperative MRI was coincident with the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder. It was speculated that in the donor patient with preexisted type II temporomandibular disorder, muscle relaxation induced by anesthesia caused the mandibular head fall behind the articular disk and dislocated the disk forwardly ending up in closed lock of temporomandibular joint.",0,0
12041624,Endoscopic survey of post-extubation stridor in children,"Endotracheal intubation is an important airway procedure in the management of neonates and infants. Prolonged intubation may result in severe laryngeal injury which may lead to chronic laryngeal disability. The nature and causes of post-extubation airway obstruction were evaluated with videoendoscopy. From June 1998 to September 2000, detailed videoendoscopic examination of pediatric airway was performed in 30 children who had persistent stridor after endotracheal extubation or failure of elective extubation. Common locations of post-extubation lesion are the posterior glottis and subglottis. Retrospective analysis of the causes of stridor included: (1) isolated intubation laryngotracheitis (n = 19); (2) intubation laryngotracheitis with neuromuscular dysfunction which resulted in tongue drop, laryngotracheal incoordination, saliva pooling over the larynx or poor cough reflex(n = 5); and (3) specific airway problems such as laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis or vocal paralysis(n = 6). We favored the term of ""intubation laryngotracheitis"" instead of ""intubation injury"" or 'intubation trauma"". Although most cases of intubation laryngotracheitis heal, leaving a normal or near-normal larynx, some of them still suffer from airway obstruction after endotracheal extubation. Specific airway problems such as severe laryngomalacia or vocal cords paralysis and neurogenic defects should also be taken into consideration.",0,0
1785711,"[Use of the PVC, a laryngoscope for difficult intubation]","The PCV (Piquet-Crinquette-Vilette) laryngoscope has been designed for use in difficult endotracheal intubation in the adult. Its blade, 170 mm long, is curved, narrow (12 mm internal diameter) and semicircular in cross-section, like a closed C. An 8 mm endotracheal tube can be pushed through this blade. There is a cold light source. The use of this blade requires a teeth protector. The epiglottis will be lifted directly, and the blade will be moved into the vestibule, stopping short of the vocal cords. The endotracheal tube will then be introduced into the laryngoscope blade which guides it in between the cords. Once the tube has been checked to be within the trachea, the laryngoscope is removed by sliding the blade backwards over the tube. The PCV may be introduced into the mouth either on the right, or on the left, or behind the molar teeth, or between two teeth. It can held with the handle horizontal in case of a prominent sternum. The limits of this tool are a mouth opening of less then 20 mm, and some rare predictable difficulties which require an X-ray assessment to determine the best intubation technique to be used. Of 115 patients with a predicted difficult endotracheal intubation, fifty were intubated with the PCV without any failures. Also, twenty-five patients, out of thirty, were successfully intubated with the PCV after an attempt with a MacIntosh blade had failed. Of these five failures, one was never intubated by any technique whatsoever, two were intubated by fibroscopy and two by the ENT surgeon.",0,0
9067050,Laryngeal mask airway in severe cervical ankylosis,"Purpose: We present a case of the successful use of a laryngeal airway (LMA) to ventilate the lungs of a patient with severe ankylosing spondylitis for surgery requiring intense muscular relaxation. The use of an LMA in such circumstances is controversial. Clinical features: The patient was a 61-yr-old man with severe emphysema, a cervical spine fixed in marked anterior flexion, and reduced mouth opening (35 mm). The patient refused an awake tracheal intubation because of a previous distressing experience with a fibreoptic awake nasal intubation and an 11 day SICU stay with controlled ventilation via an endotracheal tube. Attempts at spinal blocks had failed in the past. After administration of thiopentone and succinylcholine a #4 LMA was inserted and the lungs were safely ventilated for a 10 min reduction of a dislocated femoral head. Conclusion: The present view that severe ankylosing spondylitis is a contraindication to the use of an LMA may need revision in view of this and other reports of successful airway management in patients with that disease.",0,0
22348802,Standardizing the diagnosis of inhalation injury using a descriptive score based on mucosal injury criteria,"Introduction: Inhalation injury is an important determinant of outcome in patients with major burns. However the diagnostic criteria remain imprecise, preventing objective comparisons of published data. The aims were to evaluate the utility of an inhalation score based on mucosal injury, while assessing separately the oro-pharyngeal sphere (ENT) and tracheobronchial tree (TB) in patients admitted to the ICU with a suspicion of inhalation injury. Methods: Prospective observational study in 100 patients admitted with suspicion of inhalation injury among 168 consecutive burn admissions to the ICU of a university hospital. Inclusion criteria, endoscopic airway assessment during the first hours. ENT/TB lesion grading was 1: oedema, hyperemia, hypersecretion, 2: bullous mucosal detachment, erosion, exudates, 3: profound ulcers, necrosis. Results: Of the 100 patients (age 42±17 years, burns 23±19%BSA), 79 presented an ENT inhalation injury ≥ENT1 (soot present in 24%): 36 had a tracheobronchial extension, 33 having a grade ≥TB1. Burned vibrissae: 10 patients ""without"" suffered ENT injury, while 6 patients ""with"" had no further lesions. Length of mechanical ventilation was strongly associated with the first 24 hrs' fluid resuscitation volume (p<0.0001) and the presence of inhalation injury (p=0.03), while the ICU length of stay was correlated with the %BSA. Soot was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation (p=0.0115). There was no extubation failure. Conclusions: The developed inhalation score was simple to use, providing a unified language, and drawing attention to upper airway involvement. Burned vibrissae and suspected history proved to be insufficient diagnostic criteria. Further studies are required to validate the score in a larger population.",0,0
20196416,Modified Mallampati test and thyromental distance as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in Thai patients,"Background: Preoperative evaluation of anatomical landmarks and clinical factors are important in the detection of patients at risk for difficult laryngoscopy. The modified Mallampati test (MMT) and thyromental distance (TMD) are commonly used for this purpose but there are controversies regarding their accuracy. Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of MMT and TMD in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in Thai patients. Material and method: 1888 consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were evaluated preoperatively using the MMT and TMD. The cut-off points for the difficult airway predictors were: Mallampati 3, 4 and TMD less than 6 cm. During direct laryngoscopy, the laryngeal view was graded using the Cormack and Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult laryngoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. Results: The present study found Mallampati grade I 1050 patients (55.6%), grade II 730 patients (38.7%), grade III 104 patients (5.5%), grade IV 4 pateints (0.2%) and TMD less than 6 cm 85 patients (4.5%), TMD more than 6 cm 1803 patients (95.5%). Difficult laryngoscopy occurred in 60 patients (3.2%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the two airway predictors were: MMT 41.7%, 95.5%, 23.1% and 98.0% and TMD 23.3%, 96.1%, 16.5% and 97.4% respectively. The combination of two predictors with a sensitivity, specificity PPV and NPV were 55.0%, 92.3%, 19.1% and 98.4%. Conclusion: MMT TMD and their combination are good predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in a Thai population.",1,1
22286814,Inter-observer reproducibility of 15 tests used for predicting difficult intubation,"Aim: To determine the inter-observer reproducibility of 15 tests used for predicting difficult tracheal intubation (DI). Material and methods: Following local ethics committee approval and informed consent, 101 volunteers were examined by two assessors using 15 tests for predicting DI. The two assessors who were blinded to the results of the other, examined each volunteer independently. Cohen's kappa (κ) or first-order agreement coefficient (AC1) were used to measure agreement between assessor ratings on a qualitative scale. Agreement between two quantitative outcomes was described using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson's (PCC) or Spearman's (SCC) correlation coefficients. The following interpretation of the coefficients was used: poor (< 0.20), fair (0.21-0.40), satisfactory (0.41-0.60), good (0.61-0.80), and excellent (0.81-1.00). Results: Respective coefficients of inter-rater agreement and correlation coefficients were determined for the following parameters: pathologies associated with DI (κ=0.662, AC1=0.990), clinical impression (κ=-0.013, AC1=0.969), modified Mallampati test (κ=0.503, AC1=0.861), upper lip bite test (κ=0.370, AC1=0.897), temporo-mandibular joint movement (κ=0.088, AC1=0.797), max. anteroflexion of C-spine (ICC=0.136, SCC=0.391), max. retroflexion of C-spine (ICC=0.020, SCC=0.284), mandibular length (ICC=0.301, SCC=0.553), neck circumference (ICC=0.832, SCC=0.928), hyo-mental distance (ICC=0.378, SCC=0.472), thyro-mental distance (ICC=-0.002, PCC=0.265), sternomental distance (ICC=0.674, PCC=0.815), and finally, inter-incisor gap (ICC=0.695, PCC=0.785). Two tests (positive history of DI and retrogenia), were excluded from calculation because no positive cases were found. Conclusion: Best inter-rater agreement was found for the assessment of neck circumference while the highest discrepancies between raters were in goniometrically-measured mobility of the C-spine. Many of the pre-operative airway tests had only fair inter-observer reproducibility. This may be one reason why models for predicting difficult intubation are not universally reliable.",0,0
15058127,An assessment of small simulators used to teach basic airway management,"This study assessed small simulators sold for teaching basic airway management. The assessment used criteria based on guidelines produced by the Australian Resuscitation Council and our experience teaching health professional trainees. Criteria included how well the simulators demonstrated manoeuvres to open the airway, mouth-to-mouth and mask-to-mouth expired air resuscitation and artificial ventilation using a bag and mask. Simulators with permanently open airways (as is the case with some intubation manikins) were not tested. Each simulator was also assessed for realism in relation to look and feel, hygiene and sturdiness of construction. Clinical staff and medical students who teach basic airway management undertook a standardized assessment of nine simulators. There were significant differences between simulators that could impact on learning. Generally, models with hard surfaces tended to be less realistic in both look and feel compared to those with flexible ""skin"". Realism of lung inflation and its relationship to airway opening manoeuvres varied greatly between simulators. The Little Anne small simulator functioned most realistically in our tests.",0,0
21490818,The relationship between the predictors of obstructive sleep apnea and difficult intubation,"Background: The study was performed in order to determine the risk factors for difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients. Methods: For 115 male patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and who were undergoing palatal muscle resection (PMR), we investigated the correlation between their age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), their Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), their neck circumference and the difficulty of tracheal intubation. Results: The factors significantly related to difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients were a high AHI and a large neck circumference. There was no significant correlation between weight, BMI, arterial hypertension, ESS and difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients. Conclusions: In this study, a high AHI and a large neck circumference can predict difficult tracheal intubation in obstructive sleep apnea patients.",0,0

Clinical case],"Authors report a Launoise-Bensaude-Madelung disease case, in a 64 year old man, admitted to a Plastic Surgical Department for obesity, dysphonia, dysphagia, dyspnea. Early symptoms appeared 20 years before Hospital admission. Lipomatous tissue occupied nape, mandible, neck and shoulders. Surgical exeresis of lipomatous tissue under general anesthesia needed for the patient. Neck movements and mouth opening were short (Mallampati Score = 4); a neck computed tomography showed a tracheal compression and right displacement. Tracheal intubation was considered difficult or impossible. Nose-tracheal intubation was performed using a pediatric fiberoptic instrument as guide for a small gauge tracheal tube. Tracheal stenosis required many attempts for correct nose-tracheal intubation. Fiberoptic instrument as guide for tracheal tube can be useful for patients with Launoise-Bensaude-Madelung disease, when tracheal intubation is considered difficult or impossible. Knowledge of fiberoptic tracheal intubation techniques is mandatory for anesthesiologists, allowing tracheal intubation in patients with anatomical variations of mouth or upper respiratory airways.",0,0
25429746,Evaluation of risk factors for arytenoid dislocation after endotracheal intubation: a retrospective case-control study,"Objective: To investigate the risk factors for postoperative arytenoid dislocation. Methods: From September 2003 to August 2013, the records of 16 patients with a history of postoperative arytenoid dislocation were reviewed. Patients matched in terms of date and type of procedures were chosen as the controls (n=16). Recorded data for all patients were demographics, smoking status, alcoholic status, preoperative physical status, airway evaluation, intubation procedures, preoperative laboratory test results, anesthetic consumption and intensive care unit stay. For arytenoid dislocation cases, we further analyzed the incidences of the left and right arytenoid dislocation, and the outcomes of surgical repair and conservative treatment. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, and were compared using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables were expressed as means±SD and compared using the Student's unpaired t-test. To determine the predictors of arytenoid dislocation, a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Sixteen patients with postoperative arytenoid dislocation were enrolled, with a median age of 52 years. Most postoperative arytenoid dislocation patients (15/16, 93.75%) received surgical repair, except one patient who recovered after conservative treatment. None of the postoperative arytenoid dislocation patients were smokers. Red blood cell (P=0.044) and hemoglobin (P=0.031) levels were significantly lower among arytenoid dislocation cases compared with the controls. Conclusions: Non-smoking and anemic patients may be susceptible to postoperative arytenoid dislocation. However, neither of them was independent risk factor for postoperative arytenoid dislocation.",0,0
25868969,Airway management in patients with burn contractures of the neck,"Airway management of patients with burn contracture of the neck (PBC neck) is a challenge to the anesthesiologist. Patient evaluation includes history, physical and airway examination. A safe approach in the airway management of a patient with moderate to severe PBC neck is to secure the airway with the patient awake. The anesthesiologist should have a pre-planned strategy for intubation of the difficult airway. The choices advocated for airway management of such patients include awake fiberoptic-guided intubation, use of intubating laryngeal mask airway, intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents, intubation with neuromuscular blocking agents after testing the ability to ventilate by mask, pre-induction neck scar release under local anesthesia and ketamine or sedation followed by direct laryngoscopy and intubation and video-laryngoscope guided intubation, amongst others. Preparation of the patient includes an explanation of the proposed procedure, sedation, administration of antisialogogues and regional anesthesia of the airway. The various options for intubation of patients with PBC neck, intraoperative concerns and safe extubation are described. Back-up plans, airway rescue strategies and a review of literature on this subject are presented.",0,0
21206744,Mallampati class is not useful in the clinical assessment of sleep clinic patients,"Study objectives: To assess the utility of Mallampati class, a simple grade of oropharyngeal appearance used to assess difficulty of intubation, to predict severe obstructive sleep apnea and absence of OSA (rule in severe OSA and rule out OSA). Method: Retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic polysomnography in a tertiary referral sleep disorders center. Modified Mallampati class and other simple patient characteristics (age, gender, body mass index) were compared to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated for Mallampati class IV to detect an AHI > 30 (rule in severe OSA) and Mallampati class I to detect an AHI < 5 (rule out OSA). Results: A total of 953 consecutive patients (619 male) undergoing diagnostic polysomnography were included. The age of the cohort was 50.0 ± 6.4 years, with a BMI of 33.8 ± 8.6 kg/m² and AHI of 26.1 ± 25.1 /h (95% CI 1.4-78.8). Mallampati class was significantly associated with AHI (r = 0.13, p < 0.001), but there were no differences in AHI between Mallampati classes. A Mallampati class IV had a sensitivity of 40%, specificity of 67%, LR+ of 1.21, and LR- of 0.90 for an AHI > 30. A Mallampati class I was only 13% sensitive but 92% specific for an AHI < 5, with LR+ of 1.63 and LR- 0.90. Conclusions: Mallampati class is associated with AHI but does not significantly modify likelihood of severe OSA or absence of OSA. As such, it is of limited use to ""rule in"" severe OSA or ""rule out OSA"" in the sleep clinic population.",0,0
24215652,Straight video blades are advantageous than curved blades in simulated pediatric difficult intubation,"Background: It is still controversial which laryngoscope may be a better option in unanticipated difficult airway in pediatric patients. The aim of the present study was to compare two direct and two video-assisted laryngoscope devices for the management of difficult pediatric airway. Methods: Forty-five anesthesiology residents and nurse anesthetists participated in the study. Macintosh, Miller, Storz Miller, and McGrath Mac curved laryngoscopes were used for tracheal intubation of 3-6-month Airsim Pierre Robin manikin. We compared the duration of successful intubation, number of attempts, glottic view grades, severity of dental trauma, the use of optimization maneuvers, and the difficulty of use of the devices with straight and curved laryngoscope blades. Results: Successful intubation duration was significantly lower in Storz Miller device, and the number of intubation attempts was significantly higher in the Macintosh laryngoscope (P < 0.01). According to the Cormack and Lehane classification, Grades 1 and 2 glottic view was 20% for Macintosh and 40% for Miller laryngoscope, while it was 100% for Storz Miller and 80% for McGrath (P < 0.001). Difficulty VAS scores of Storz Miller device were significantly lower than the scores of Macintosh, Miller, and McGrath laryngoscopes (15.7 ± 14.89, 34.7 ± 26.44, 31.5 ± 26.74, 33.4 ± 26.67 mm, respectively; P < 0.01). The severity of dental trauma was significantly lower in Storz Miller compared with Macintosh, Miller, and McGrath laryngoscopes (0.96 ± 1.04, 1.67 ± 1.15, 1.38 ± 1.05, 1.42 ± 1.27, respectively; P < 0.01).

14570789,Randomized comparison of the classic Laryngeal Mask Airway with the Airway Management Device during anaesthesia,"Background: We compared the modified Airway Management Device (AMD) with the classic Laryngeal Mask Airway (cLMA) in a randomized comparative trial. Methods: Primary outcome was success of airway placement. Secondary outcomes included time to achieve an airway, airway manipulations required, complications during use and fibre-optic assessment of airway positioning. Results: We planned to study 300 patients but interim analysis demonstrated the study should be stopped after 100 patients. The AMD was inserted on the first attempt less frequently than the cLMA (P=0.04). Eight AMDs and one cLMA could not be placed within three attempts (P=0.03). The AMD required more attempts (P=0.03) and more manipulations (P=0.02) and caused more complications (P=0.01) during insertion. During maintenance of anaesthesia, three AMDs and no cLMAs had to be removed as a result of complications. Seal pressure was better with the AMD than with the cLMA (AMD 25 cm H2O, cLMA 20 cm H2O, P=0.001). Efficacy of ventilation was better with the cLMA than with the AMD (P=0.005). On fibre-optic examination, positioning over the larynx was better with the cLMA than with the AMD (P=0.005). Two of 32 attempts to pass an orogastric tube via the AMD were successful. During recovery, two AMDs and no cLMAs required premature removal. Tolerance during emergence, the incidence of blood on the devices and the incidence of postoperative complications were equivalent between devices. Overall failure rate of the AMD was greater than that of the cLMA (P=0.001). Conclusions: Successful insertion of the cLMA is more likely than that of the AMD. Insertion of the AMD required more attempts and caused a greater number of complications. Fibre-optic position was poorer than with the cLMA. When an airway is established, the AMD caused a greater number of complications during anaesthesia and failed more frequently than the cLMA. During recovery from anaesthesia, more complications occurred with the AMD. Overall performance of the AMD was poorer than with the classic LMA.",0,0
20337000,[Use of a rigid laryngoscope and a flexible nasal fiberoptic scope to assess the difficult airway: description of 3 cases],"Indirect inspection of the airway using a 70 degrees rigid laryngoscope plus a flexible nasal fiberoptic scope can provide additional information when the anesthesiologist foresees that airway management will be difficult. These devices are useful for detecting structural abnormalities, they can be attached to the same visualization system, and they do not require topical anesthesia or sedation of the patient. We report on 3 patients diagnosed with difficult airway. Inspection with a rigid laryngoscope during the preanesthetic assessment visit revealed abnormalities that prevented visualization of the glottis. In the first case, the epiglottis was absent, as it had been removed with a surrounding tumor; in the second and third cases, an epiglottic deformity and hypertrophy of the base of the tongue were found. A flexible nasal fiberoptic scope gave an unobstructed view of the glottis in these cases, making it easier to choose an intubation method.",0,0
26280546,Tongue Volume Influences Lowest Oxygen Saturation but Not Apnea-Hypopnea Index in Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify correlations between sleep apnea severity and tongue volume or posterior airway space measured via three-dimensional reconstruction of volumetric computerized tomography (CT) images in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for use in predicting OSA severity and in surgical treatment. We also assessed associations between tongue volume and Mallampati score. Methods: Snoring/OSA male patients (n = 64) who underwent polysomnography, cephalometry, and CT scans were enrolled in this retrospective study. OSA was diagnosed when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was greater than 5 (mild 5-14; moderate 15-29; severe>30). The patients were also categorized into the normal-mild group (n = 22) and the moderate-severe group (n = 42). Using volumetric CT images with the three-dimensional reconstruction technique, the volume of the tongue, posterior airway space volume, and intra-mandibular space were measured. The volumes, polysomnographic parameters, and physical examination findings were compared, and independent factors that are related to OSA were analysed. Results: No associations between tongue volume or posterior airway space and the AHI were observed. However, multivariate linear analyses showed that tongue volume had significantly negative association with lowest O2 saturation (r = 0.365, p = 0.027). High BMI was related to an increase in tongue volume. Modified Mallampati scores showed borderline significant positive correlations with absolute tongue volume (r = 0.251, p = 0.046) and standardized tongue volume (absolute tongue volume / intramandibular area; r = 0.266, p = 0.034). Between the normal-mild and moderate-severe groups, absolute tongue volumes were not different, although the standardized tongue volume in the moderate-severe group was significantly higher. Conclusion: Absolute tongue volume showed stronger associations with lowest O2 saturation during sleep than with the severity of AHI. We also found that high BMI was a relevant factor for an increase in absolute tongue volume and modified Mallampati grading was a useful physical examination to predict tongue size.",0,0
21602973,Comparison of the ease of laryngeal mask airway ProSeal insertion and the fiberoptic scoring according to the head position and the presence of a difficult airway,"Background: The sniffing position is recommended for conventional laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion. However, there has been a high success rate of LMA insertion with the head in the neutral position. The effect of a difficult airway on the ease of LMA insertion is not clear. In this study, we compared the ease of LMA ProSeal™ (PLMA) insertion and the fiberoptic scoring according to the head position and the presence of a difficult airway. Methods: After obtaining informed consent from the subjects, we enrolled 144 adult patients (age range: 18-65) with an ASA physical status 1 or 2. After evaluation of the airway, all the patients were grouped into the EA (easy airway) group (n = 68) and the DA (difficult airway) group (n = 76). According to the head position, each group was divided into the EA-SE (extension) group (n = 35), the EA-SN (sniffing) group (n = 33), the DA-SE group (n = 39) and the DA-SN group (n = 37). The success rate and insertion time at the first attempt were evaluated. The position of the PLMA was fiberoptically scored from the mask aperture of the airway tube in the original head position. After the head position was changed to the sniffing and neutral positions in the SE and SN group, respectively, the position of PLMA was re-evaluated fiberoptically. Results: The success rate and insertion time at the first attempt and the fiberoptic score showed no significant difference among the groups. After head position was changed, there were no significant changes in the fiberopitc scores. Conclusions: A difficult airway and the head position had no influence on the ease of PLMA insertion and the fiberopic score. Therefore, the head position can be selected according to the individual patient's situation.",0,0
23683449,Use of simple clinical predictors on preoperative diagnosis of difficult endotracheal intubation in obese patients,"Background and objectives: Although the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy is similar in obese and non-obese patients, there are more reports of difficult intubation in obese individuals. Alternatives for the diagnosis and prediction of difficult intubation in the preoperative period may help reduce anesthetic complications in obese patients. The aim of this study was to identify predictors for the diagnosis of difficult airway in obese patients, correlating with the clinical methods of pre-anesthetic evaluation and polysomnography. We also compared the incidence of difficult facemask ventilation and difficult laryngoscopy between obese and non-obese patients, identifying the most prevalent predictors. Methods: Observational, prospective and comparative study, with 88 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. In the preoperative period, we evaluated a questionnaire on the clinical predictors of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and anatomical parameters. During anesthesia, we evaluated difficult facemask ventilation and laryngoscopy. Descriptive statistics and correlation test were used for analysis. Results: Patients were allocated into two groups: obese group (n=43) and non-obese group (n=45). Physical status, prevalence of snoring, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, neck circumference, and Mallampati index were higher in the obese group. Obese patients had a higher incidence of difficult facemask ventilation and laryngoscopy. There was no correlation between anatomical or clinical variable and difficult facemask ventilation in both groups. In obese patients, the diagnosis of OSAS showed strong correlation with difficult laryngoscopy. Conclusions: The clinical and polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA proved useful in the preoperative diagnosis of difficult laryngoscopy. Obese patients are more prone to difficult facemask ventilation and laryngoscopy.",0,0
10989859,Variations in ILMA external diameters: another cause of device failure,"Purpose: To report failure of insertion of #5 and #4 intubating laryngeal mask airways (ILMAs) in a patient with a mouth opening of just under 25 mm, and the variances among same-size ILMAs. Clinical features: A 53-yr-old man with obstructive sleep apnea underwent elective ENT surgical repair. His mouth opening was just under 25 mm. Ventilation by mask was easy. Direct laryngoscopy failed after induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular block. Neither a #5 nor a #4 ILMA could be passed between the patient's teeth, despite different twisting maneuvres. A #4 LMA was thus prepared as a conduit for fibreoptic intubation. Placement of the LMA was easy, as was fibreoptic-guided intubation. The LMA was removed over the tracheal tube (TT) to enable ENT surgery, and the further course was uneventful. Manual examination showed that, unlike others of the same type, the failed ILMAs were not sufficiently compressible either to allow insertion in this patient or to the 20 mm reported as the maximal outer dimension of the device. Radiological examination revealed that, at the point of the device where it is intended to be compressible, the silicone layer was thicker in the failed devices than in stock compressible ILMAs, and the end of the steel tube was not so sharply beveled. Conclusion: Our inability to insert an ILMA in a patient with an interdental distance of just under 25 mm was because the device was not sufficiently compressible although the manufacturer states the maximal outer dimension to be 20 mm.",0,0
27366492,Comparison of the Macintosh and Airtraq Laryngoscopes in Endotracheal Intubation Success,"Objective: Endotracheal intubation of patients is an effective method for controlling airway and breathing. However, laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation is not easy in every case. There is a recent abundance of equipment used for controlling ventilation and intubation. Airtraq is one of those equipments. In this study, our main objective is to compare the success rates of the Airtraq and Macintosh (direct and classic) laryngoscopes in endotracheal intubation. Methods: In this single-center, prospective, randomized, clinical study was performed on 80 patients who were operated under general anesthesia, ASA I-II, 18-65 years old. Patients were intubated using two different endotracheal intubation tools. Group A was intubated using the Macintosh (direct and classic) laryngoscope, meanwhile Group B was intubated using the Airtraq laryngoscope. Patients' snoring complaints, modified Mallampati scores, sternomental distances, thyromental distances, interincisor distance measurements and Cormack-Lehane (C-L) laryngoscopic classification, upper lip bite test results, intubation time, number of intubation attempts, maneuvers and techniques used for facilitating intubation and complications arising from intubation were recorded. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of C-L scores (p=0.041). In all, 8 patients in the Macintosh group, and 2 patients in the Airtraq group were C-L grade III. In intubation of the Airtraq group, only 3 patients required facilitating techniques, meanwhile in intubation of the Macintosh group 15 patients we had to use one or more facilitating maneuver. The rate of Mallampati scoring ""difficult"" was 4/6 in the Macintosh and 2/11 in Airtraq laryngoscopy groups (p=0.553). Conclusion: In cases with seemingly difficult intubations, we believe the Airtraq laryngoscope has an advantage over the Macintosh laryngoscope, owing to its better view of the oropharyngeal and glottic areas in addition to facilitating intubation in patients with limited head extension.",0,0
1862892,Intubation through the laryngeal mask. A technique for unexpected difficult intubation,"Unexpected difficulty with tracheal intubation contributes to anaesthetic mortality. The laryngeal mask can almost always be placed satisfactorily and its position should facilitate blind intubation. A 6-mm cuffed tube will pass through both adult sizes of the mask and this study tested the feasibility of intubation through the mask. The effect of the application of cricoid pressure on the technique was also investigated. Intubation via the laryngeal mask was attempted in 100 routine patients: of the first 50 (group 1, no cricoid pressure), 45 (90%) were successfully intubated. Maintenance of cricoid pressure throughout the manoeuvre (group 2) reduced the success rate significantly to 56% (p less than 0.05). Despite the possibility that cricoid pressure may have to be interrupted momentarily, the ease with which the technique can be learnt, and the immediate availability of the necessary apparatus suggest that it should be considered for inclusion in failed intubation drill.",0,0
26903674,Current practice of difficult airway management: A survey,"Background and aims: Difficult airway (DA) management depends on both training and actual usage of the various approaches in the event of difficulty. The aim of the study was to assess how well the anaesthesiologists are equipped to deal with DA situations. The current practice preference of DA management was also assessed. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed in a continuing medical education (CME) programme dedicated to DA and responses were noted and analysed, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18. Results: The response rate was 73%. Airway assessment was performed by majority. Sixty eight percent consultants and 47% residents were well aware of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' DA algorithm. 67% consultants and 65% residents attended at least one CME on DA in the previous 5 years. There was an overall deficiency of video laryngoscopes, retrograde intubation and cricothyrotomy sets. Most of the respondents were comfortable in using supraglottic airway devices (SGADs). In anticipated DA, the preferred choice of management for junior doctors was attempting conventional method once and awake fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) for the experienced. In unanticipated DA, most of the residents and consultants opted for SGAD. Extubation strategy was similar for both. Thirty four percent of respondents experienced a 'cannot intubate-cannot ventilate' situation at least once. Conclusion: Our survey showed that most respondents performed routine pre-operative airway assessment. A good armamentarium of airway gadgets should be made available in hospitals. Further training in techniques like video laryngoscopy, FOB or cricothyrotomy are essential.",0,0
19697822,[Rocuronium vs atracurium vs suxamethonium for double-lumen endobronchial tube intubation],"Background: Intubation with a double lumen tube requires excellent and stable relaxation, necessary for accurate positioning of the device using a fibre optic scope. Methods: We have compared conditions for endobronchial intubation after administration of 1 mg kg(-1) rocuronium (group E), 0.1 mg kg(-1) cis-atracurium (group N) and 1.5 mg kg(-1) suxamethonium (group P) in 70 randomly allocated adult patients, scheduled for elective lung surgery. Conditions for intubation were assessed using Mallampati, Cromack-Lehan and Krieg scores. Results: The duration and conditions for intubation, and the onset of relaxation were comparable in all groups. Patients paralysed with suxamethonium required more frequent repositioning of double lumen tubes, compared to those paralysed with rocuronium and cis-atracurium. Discussion: Although all drugs given in equipotent doses proved to be suitable for the planned procedure, we conclude that suxamethonium could easily be abandoned in routine anaesthesia for elective lung surgery.",0,0
25900232,What Factors Influence Community Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons' Choice to Use Capnography in the Office-Based Ambulatory Anesthesia Setting?,"Purpose: The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons Board of Trustees mandated monitoring using capnography during moderate sedation (MS) and deep sedation or general anesthesia (DS/GA) delivered in the office setting effective January 1, 2014. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of capnography use and to identify variables associated with a clinician's choice to use capnography before the mandate. Materials and methods: To address the research purpose, the authors designed a prospective cohort study and enrolled 2 samples: 1) American private practicing oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) and 2) all eligible patients for whom these OMSs delivered MS or DS/GA. The predictor variables were categorized as surgeon or patient demographics, anesthesia risk factors, procedure-related variables, and anesthetic medications. The outcome variable was capnography use during MS or DS/GA. Descriptive, bivariate, and forward stepwise multiple logistic regression statistics were computed to evaluate the association between the predictor variables and capnography use, with statistical significance set at a P value less than or equal to .05. Results: The surgeon sample was composed of 95 OMSs and 13.7% reported using capnography. The patient sample included 3,495 patients with a mean age of 30.6 years (standard deviation, 17.8 yr), 43.5% were men, and 5.6% were monitored using capnography. Based on bivariate analyses, 17 variables were associated with capnography use. Forward stepwise regression modeling identified 9 variables statistically associated with capnography use. These variables were patient's age, Mallampati airway score, alcohol consumption, board certification, sevoflurane use, number of monitoring methods, electrocardiogram use, precordial stethoscope use, and number of personnel in operating suite. Conclusions: Although this study might be of historical interest at this time, the results offer insight into OMSs' practice patterns before the mandatory requirement to use capnography. As more OMSs comply with the capnography mandate, their practice patterns involving variables found to statistically correlate with capnography use might become more similar to those of early adopters of this technology.",0,0
16564296,Tracheobronchopathia osteoplastica: cause of difficult tracheal intubation,"Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica is a rare benign disorder affecting the trachea and the bronchi. We report a case presenting as difficulty during tracheal intubation. Chest roentgenogram revealed nothing before surgery. Findings on computed tomographic imaging scans show calcified nodular densities protruding into the tracheal lumen, with an abnormally irregular tracheal morphology and decreased lateral diameter. The fiber optic bronchoscopy, which was unable to pass more than 4 to 5 cm, showed enormous prominent protrusion with significant narrowing of the tracheal lumen. The diagnosis was confirmed by virtual bronchoscopy, which showed a tracheal narrowing with a beaded appearance and an irregular border that extended into the trachea and main bronchi.",0,0
11861352,Submucous fibrosis secondary to chewing of quids: another cause of unanticipated difficult intubation,"Purpose: To report a case of unusual difficult intubation secondary to oral submucosal fibrosis (SMF) associated with malignancy of the hypopharynx. Clinical features: A 57-yr-old male, ASA-I physical status presented for percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. The patient was a known alcoholic and smoker with a habit of chewing quids for the past 36 years. Airway assessment revealed oral SMF and slight difficulty in opening the mouth fully. Mentohyoid and mentothyroid distances were normal. However, during intubation, unanticipated difficulty was encountered. On direct laryngoscopy, the tip of the epiglottis could barely be visualized. Intubation was possible after passing a gum elastic bougie blindly under the epiglottis and negotiating a 7.0 internal diameter tracheal tube over it. Postoperatively, indirect laryngoscopy (IDL) showed severe SMF involving the oral cavity, epiglottis and pyriform fossae and an ulcerative malignancy of the hypopharynx with fixation of the left hemilarynx. Conclusion: SMF is a premalignant condition of the oral cavity associated with fibrosis of involved structures that can be associated with malignancy of the aerodigestive tract. Distortion of the airway anatomy may render intubation difficult. IDL maybe useful in the preoperative evaluation of these patients.",0,0
16428573,"An evaluation of the insertion and function of a new supraglottic airway device, the King LT, during spontaneous ventilation","Trials of the King LT trade mark (LT, King Systems, Noblesville, IN) in controlled ventilation of the lungs have shown that it is an effective supraglottic airway device. We designed this study to evaluate the King LT regarding ease of insertion, position within the airway, and anatomic sealing properties during spontaneous ventilation in 50 ASA physical status I-III, Mallampati I-III, adult patients undergoing routine general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with up to 2 microg/kg fentanyl and 1.5-2 mg/kg propofol and maintained with 70% N2O/30%O2 and isoflurane. Insertion time, oropharyngeal leak pressures, fiberoptic position, and spirometry and hemodynamic data were recorded. Any complications were noted. Insertion was determined to be easy and a patent airway was achieved in all patients. First, second, and third attempt insertion rates were 86%, 12%, and 2%, respectively. Time to place the King LT trade mark was <5 s in 90% of cases. Baseline leak pressures were 31 +/- 8.8 cm H2O (17-50 cm H2O). Complications included laryngospasm (1) and coughing (3) on extubation. The incidence of sore throat at 1 h and 24 h postoperatively was 22% and 15%, respectively. The King LT trade mark is a simple and reliable supraglottic airway device for airway management during spontaneous ventilation.",0,0
